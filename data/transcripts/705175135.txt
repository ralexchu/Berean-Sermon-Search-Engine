[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   I'll be reading from verse 5 through 10 this morning.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:25.320]   Luke chapter 1 verse 5 through 10.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040]   Luke chapter 1 verses 5 through 10.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.440]   In the days of Herod king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias of the division
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.000]   of Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.900]   They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.980]   and requirements of the Lord.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840]   But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.560]   Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly service before God in the appointed
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.200]   order of his division, according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by law
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.360]   to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.640]   And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640]   offering.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.240]   Let's pray.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.160]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.560]   We pray, Father God, that your word would really speak to us, allow us to hear your
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.440]   voice, Lord God, and not just words of men.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.480]   Help us, Lord, to be illuminated, to not only know your thoughts, but your own heart.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.880]   We pray that we would get a glimpse of who you are, that we may learn to love you, to
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.840]   honor you, to obey you in all things.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.240]   You know, oftentimes when various things happen in our life, we don't have a complete answer
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.680]   as to why is this happening, because we're not able to see the big picture.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.200]   We don't see the past.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.640]   We don't see what this is going to lead to.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.960]   So we oftentimes just trust that God is sovereign.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.280]   We don't know where this is going.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.120]   And typically we will read verses like Romans 8, 28, says, "We know that God causes all
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.080]   things to work together for good, to those who love God, to those who are called according
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   to his purpose."
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.780]   And so we use that verse to encourage one another, to encourage ourselves, to remind
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.400]   us that God is sovereign.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.880]   But oftentimes we don't know exactly where this is headed.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.240]   And so when we look at redemptive history, we're able to see the fruition of these passages.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.520]   What does he mean by this?
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.240]   What has God been doing behind this scene?
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.640]   Galatians 4, verse 4 says, "But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth his
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   Son.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.480]   Born of a woman, born under the law, God waited for the perfect time."
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.720]   What made it the perfect time?
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.680]   And I remember thinking early on, and you hear maybe other people saying, "It made
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.640]   a perfect time because the Romans, you know, they came into power and they created all
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.440]   these roads.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.680]   So that if you were going to go evangelize to the remotest part of the world, that would
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.720]   have been the perfect time because all the roads have been created so that they can pretty
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.220]   much get anywhere they needed to go."
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.960]   Or it was a perfect time because the language was united.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.480]   The Greeks did such a great job of bringing people together, all of a sudden they were
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   able to communicate.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.040]   They had the local language and then they had Greek language.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.320]   And so because of that, now they were able to communicate with one another.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.920]   Politically, Romans conquered so much of the land that they were able to move from place
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.120]   to place and didn't have much problem.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.740]   Now, all of these things may be true, but none of that is mentioned in the Bible.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.920]   Those are just speculations that, yes, it was an ideal time.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.720]   But what the Bible does mention is that God waited until the law exposed sin to be utterly
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.400]   sinful.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.680]   He allowed sin to have its full effect.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.160]   In fact, when you study the book of Romans, Romans begins by telling us this very thing.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.320]   And if you've studied the book of Romans, if you were with us a while back, and Romans
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.680]   chapter one was a long time ago.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.640]   But if you look at Romans chapter one, it's clear that the reference that he's making
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.880]   to specifically is to the nation of Israel.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.080]   Even though it has ramification to all the nations, he specifically says the nation of
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.980]   Israel, for even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.360]   But they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened, professing
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.600]   to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of God for the incorruptible God,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.060]   glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.200]   and of four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.160]   Now again, this can be applied to all mankind, but specifically it's in reference to how
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.560]   God has given them the law.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.640]   He showed his glory.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.760]   He performed miracles.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.800]   And yet, though God made it very clear to them who he is, showed them the glory, they
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.320]   chose to continue to chase after idols.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.800]   And this basically is Israel's history.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.720]   So it says in verse four, all the way down to verse 28, three separate times he mentions,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.400]   therefore God gave them over.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.440]   Verse 24, therefore God gave them over in the lust of their hearts to impurity so that
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.040]   their bodies would be dishonored among them for they exchanged the truth of God for a
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.560]   lie, worshipped and served the creatures rather than the creator who is blessed forever.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.760]   Amen.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.080]   And then again in verse 26, for this reason God gave them over to degrading passions.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.680]   For their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.080]   And in the same way also the man abandoned natural function of the women and burned in
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.000]   their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.400]   Again in verse 28, and just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.040]   gave them over to depraved minds to do those things which are not proper.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.640]   So three separate times in chapter one he says wrath of God is being revealed and even
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.920]   though he made who he is through natural revelation, specifically to the Jews through special revelation
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.040]   through the law, and yet they continue to chase after idols, reject him, and he says
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.720]   God gave them over, God gave them over, God gave them over.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.960]   So Israel's history is a repeating cycle of a rebellion against God and as a result
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.980]   of that falling into sin and then God allowing this sin to bear the fruit that it's supposed
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.840]   to bear.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.800]   The reason why I say all of this is because Luke breaks into this darkness.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.960]   And so it's important for us to first recognize why, what made this the fullness of time?
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.280]   Why at this time was Jesus coming?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   Why couldn't he have come 400 years before?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.080]   Why didn't he come 400 years later?
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.720]   It's almost as if God was waiting for whatever it is that they were chasing after to have
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:13.080]   its full effect so that when Christ comes and he turns the light on, the people who
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.480]   are in darkness would recognize immediately that must be Christ.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.200]   There's three people that are mentioned here that I'm going to go over that on the surface
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680]   kind of seems random, right?
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.960]   Because Luke started by saying that he's going to make an orderly account, a careful
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   account.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.040]   He's going to interview eyewitnesses and he's going to present it probably in a chronological
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.640]   manner at least to the best of his ability and to present to Theophilus so that he may
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.840]   be convicted about things that he's already heard of, right?
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.120]   So typically in other Gospels they'll either start right off with Jesus or they'll jump
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.200]   into John the Baptist shows up and he does ministry and he gets baptized and boom they
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.320]   go into ministry.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:04.760]   Here he spends quite a bit of time in chapter one of something that seems almost insignificant,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   right?
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   At least on the surface.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.800]   Initially he starts by saying Herod the Idrimian was the king of that time.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.400]   Now superficially that's how they dated things at that time, right?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.800]   Today if we want to keep a record of something we would say on this particular day, on 9/11/2001
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.460]   this happened, right?
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.360]   And we know exactly when that happened.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.840]   Well at that particular time in order to date something they would date it based on who
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.560]   was the king at the time.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.800]   This is the third year of king so and so or the fourth year or the beginning year of this
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.200]   and that's how they knew exactly when this happened.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:49.240]   But in the Gospels it has greater significance than just dating when this happens.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.760]   Because if you look at Israel's history it's filled with God pleading with the nation of
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.360]   Israel to turn from their sin and warning them that if they do not a foreign nation
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.060]   is going to come and dominate over them.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:11.000]   He warns prophet after prophet after prophet that if you do not turn from your sin that
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.880]   the Assyrians are coming, that the Babylonians are coming, that they will come and take away
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:25.400]   your strongmen, your wives, your children and you will no longer be a nation.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.200]   Well that's exactly what happens.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.920]   The Assyrians come in 900 BC and they take the northern kingdom into captivity.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.680]   All ten of the tribes are taken into captivity never to be restored again.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.520]   In 587 BC the Babylonians come and they take the southern kingdom, Judah and the Benjamites
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.560]   and then they go into captivity.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:54.400]   And so for over 900 years Israel's history is one oppression from a foreign nation, from
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.440]   a pagan nation after another.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.200]   Assyrians come in, the Babylonians come in, after that the Persians come in.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:10.360]   During the Persian era God raises up a pagan king, King Cyrus and softens his heart and
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.620]   he allows the nation of Israel to return back to their land to rebuild their temple.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:22.540]   But by that time Israelites have forgotten and have been moved so far away from God that
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.200]   even though they had every support that they needed to go back and rebuild the nation,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.520]   only a very small remnant returned, drop in a bucket.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.520]   Which means majority of them have already forgotten about the covenant.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.760]   Whatever promises that God made, they've already forgotten about it because their life has
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.880]   become so easy in Babylon.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.720]   They've integrated into Persia.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.660]   It's in the middle of this that Malachi is sent as a prophet and he's the last prophet
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.360]   and after him there's 400 years where God no longer sends a prophet.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.000]   Malachi 3.1 says, "Behold I am going to send my messenger and he will clear the way before
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.680]   me.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.800]   And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple and the messenger of the covenant
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.880]   in whom you delight, behold he is coming says the Lord of hosts."
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   So the last prophet, the last thing that he says is that once all this period that God
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.520]   has ordained because of your sin, after that period is done, he will come.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.960]   The messenger is going to come, John the Baptist is going to come and he's going to prepare
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.480]   for the Messiah to come and that's the last prophecy that was given to the nation of Israel.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.160]   And then there's 400 years of silence.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   No prophet is sent.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.200]   Now for 400 years, even though there was no prophet, it doesn't mean that there was nothing
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.880]   going on.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.200]   After that the Greeks take over and they Hellenize everybody.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.560]   If the Babylonians and the Persians made it easy to integrate into the pagan nation, the
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.800]   Greeks made it much easier.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.480]   I mean they even given them a name for some people who were Hellenized.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.840]   Meaning they integrated so well that they began to lose their culture and even their
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   language.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.320]   They said they were Hellenized Jews.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.720]   They were Jew by heritage but in everything else they were Greeks.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.200]   That's how good of a job that the Greeks did.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.480]   And more and more people start to drift away from who God is.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.560]   And then after the Greeks leave, they have turmoil during that period.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:37.160]   There's some hope during the Hasmonean rebellion but that is almost immediately crushed.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.560]   And then the Romans come in and they completely dominate.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:50.640]   Romans conquered so much of that modern nation that they had to put puppet figures all over
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   it.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.280]   You know kind of like what's going on with Russia and Ukraine right now.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.520]   The Russia came into Ukraine because they want to set up a puppet president that they
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.800]   can control.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.080]   So they can make sure that that area is going to benefit them.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.920]   Well that's exactly what happened with Israel.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:17.080]   So King Herod of this time was a puppet king whose main job was to suppress rebellion from
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.040]   the Jews and to appease the Romans.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.720]   So who he was on the surface is pretty obvious by what he did.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.880]   Remember the temple that Jesus comes in and he cleanses the temple right?
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.080]   And he does that twice during his ministry.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   That temple was built by this king, King Herod.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.120]   Now you look at that and you say, "Wow he must have cared about his religion.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.660]   He must have clearly had some affection for God."
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:57.440]   But this same king who made the temple, that same king also made dozens of pagan temples.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.600]   So this guy wasn't the king of Israel.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.000]   He was just a politician who's trying to appease both sides.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.280]   Now that in and of itself just kind of gives us a historical background of what's going
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:16.600]   on but this king was so paranoid that his own family members would usurp his authority
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.240]   that anybody that he considered a threat he just murdered.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.940]   Kind of like what's going on in North Korea right?
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.340]   Anybody that Kim Jong-un thinks is a threat they're gone.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.980]   And that's basically what this king did.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:37.020]   So if that wasn't enough, it's made very clear in Matthew chapter 2, 16 to 17, this king
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.380]   was so paranoid that, let me just read it for you in verse 16 it says, "Then when Herod
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:50.340]   saw that he had been tricked by the Magi, he became very enraged and sent and slew all
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:56.200]   the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity from two years old and under
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.980]   according to the time which he had determined from the Magi."
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.940]   Imagine if you were a young family of that time and you had a child under the age of
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.500]   two.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.180]   And this king who wasn't even a Jew, he was an Edomite, who was a traitor to his people
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:20.020]   and he was basically a politician setting up pagan nations, pagan temples, now came
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.440]   and killed one of your children.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:28.160]   Simply because he was afraid that one of those children were going to be usurping his authority,
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.940]   that he was going to be the king of the Jews, the true king of the Jews was coming.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:40.020]   And just for that alone, he went and slaughtered all the children under the age of two.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:46.380]   Imagine the frustration, the anger, the bitterness, the sadness that Israel was under at this
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.900]   time.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.240]   And they had no power.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.940]   And if they didn't submit, they would have come and completely destroyed them.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.280]   So there was constant turmoil among the Jewish nation.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:03.960]   And so mentioning Herod the Edomite, just knowing the background, the context of which
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.920]   he says it, and all of this is to emphasize for us that this has become a dark period
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.240]   in Israel's history.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.840]   Sin has become utterly sinful as a nation.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.200]   God gave them over to their lust, God gave them over to their passion, God gave them
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.240]   over to what they pursued in their rebellion, and as a result of that, this is the fruit
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.480]   of the nation of Israel.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.280]   But along with that, we have two other people mentioned here that on the surface doesn't
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.960]   make any sense.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   Zacharias.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.160]   Now, we know he's a significant figure simply because he's in the Bible.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.440]   Why is Zacharias even mentioned?
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:50.480]   Like President Biden today, he was a vice president for eight years under Obama.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:57.440]   What did you know about President Obama or President Biden today when he was vice president?
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.480]   Almost nothing, right?
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.280]   Because usually what happens is if the president comes out and you do a piece on the president,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.680]   and you may do a little side piece on the vice president, because his whole job is if
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.040]   he dies, he'll step in.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.960]   So unless there's a danger of Obama dying, usually they'll just say, oh, this guy's a
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.640]   politician, these are his views, and then they move on, right?
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.560]   They don't do a piece about his mom, his dad, and even Hunter Biden, what's going on.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.000]   All of that was revealed because he's a president, but while he was vice president, nobody really
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.120]   cared.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.600]   Remember President Bush, right?
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   Remember his vice president?
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.960]   Remember who he was?
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.640]   Most of you, many of you probably already forgot, right?
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   Dick Cheney.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.240]   Do you remember his wife's name?
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.120]   Mrs. Cheney, right?
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.440]   We don't know.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:06.720]   You don't know anything about Dick Cheney's wife or husband, not husband, but mom or dad.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.240]   You don't know because he was just a side piece, right?
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.440]   Just in case Bush dies, but we don't know much about him.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.080]   So imagine if the president is, you know, they're running for president, they do a piece
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.000]   about the vice president, not only the piece about the vice president, but his mom and
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.140]   dad.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.420]   You would never do that.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.080]   But that's exactly what happens here.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.520]   He says he's going to give an orderly account, and he starts with John the Baptist, who's
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.480]   supposed to go six months before him, and then spends almost a whole chapter talking
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.360]   about Zacharias and Elizabeth.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.840]   But we have to ask, like, why is he, why are they in here?
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   What's the purpose?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840]   Why is he being highlighted?
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.880]   Clearly there must be a purpose.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   Zacharias' name literally means God has remembered again.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.480]   Just by the name, you know what's going on.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.020]   His name means God has remembered again.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:13.520]   Not God has remembered, not God has forgotten, but God has remembered again.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.400]   And the reason why this is significant is because all throughout Israel's history is
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.000]   a repeat cycle over and over again.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.540]   You know, many people study the book of Hosea, and they come out and say, well, it's a great
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.580]   love story between God and sinful nation, and how God is so patient.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.960]   God tells Hosea to marry this prostitute, basically, who continues to commit adultery
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.480]   against him, and God continues to chase after him, and he illustrates this between the relationship
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.800]   with Hosea and Gomer.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.960]   And typically we come out saying, well, what a beautiful story of God's unconditional love
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.000]   towards sinners.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.480]   Now that may be true, but if you study the book of Hosea carefully, Hosea is actually
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.080]   a rebuke to the nation.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.440]   It's not just saying, oh, look how much God loves us.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.600]   All that is true.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.280]   But if you study it, the end result is because God has given you chance after chance after
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:16.520]   chance after chance, and you continue to commit adultery, that the Assyrians are coming, the
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   nations are coming, and you're going to be under their bondage.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.640]   And for 900 years this happens.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.740]   But along with the judgment against the nation of Israel, almost every prophet that brings
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:38.040]   judgment upon Israel, God always ends, almost always ends, with a glimmer of hope.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:43.640]   That hope is mentioned in Hosea chapter 14, 4 through 6, is I will heal their apostasy.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.960]   I will love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.080]   I will be like the dew to Israel.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.320]   He will blossom like the lily, and he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.240]   His shoots will sprout, and his beauty will be like the olive tree, and his fragrance
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.360]   like the cedars of Lebanon.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.960]   Can you imagine if you heard everything that Hosea was saying, and the captivity actually
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   happens exactly like Hosea said, they would be holding on to this passage and say, when
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.360]   is this going to happen?
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.040]   We get it, we sinned, we made a mistake, we want to repent, but when is this going to
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   happen?
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.840]   They waited 900 years for the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:33.160]   Now God initiated it, the final fulfillment will happen at the end, but this is what they
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:40.800]   were waiting for, and so when Zacharias appears, God has remembered again.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.440]   Despite your sins, God has not forgotten.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.720]   Again he will remember you.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.360]   Zacharias it says was a priest of the order of Abijah, and Elizabeth is a descendant of
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:01.520]   Aaron himself, and so they were priests together, and again to better understand what's going
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.880]   on here, there were 18,000 priests at that time.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.600]   Of 18,000 priests, and obviously they're not, you know, you don't need that many people
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.560]   to go in and out of the temple, so they divided into 24 orders, and so he was under one of
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:23.400]   those orders, Abijah, and so if your group happened to be chosen, you came and served
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   one, two weeks out of the year, whole year, and out of that they would throw lots, and
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.880]   whoever gets chosen, one priest would represent and go into the holy, holies, not the holy
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.920]   of holies, and then they were able to light the candle representing the prayers of the
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.920]   nation.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.840]   That's why all the priests are sitting, standing outside praying for the nation, and that one
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.600]   priest that was chosen would go in and light these candles representing the prayers.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.880]   You have to understand for a priest, that's like winning the lottery, because majority
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.880]   of them would never have this privilege.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:10.000]   Now John the Baptist was prophesied, right, 400 years before he came, so Zacharias is
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.800]   the father that was necessary for the son to come, yet all of this happens on the surface,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.640]   seems like by chance.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.680]   Even his choosing, you would think that, you know, Zacharias, there's some angel would
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   appear and say, Zacharias, you come inside.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   Instead, a lot takes place, and then just randomly, it's like rolling dice.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:37.480]   It falls on him, and he wins the lottery, and he goes in to light the candle.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.440]   What seems chaotic and random on the surface is never random, because we believe in a sovereign
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.920]   God.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.160]   In Proverbs 16, 32, it says, "The lot is cast into the lap, but every decision is from the
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.240]   Lord."
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   Even the lot casting.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.840]   Remember in Acts chapter 2, after Judas betrays, there's only 11 apostles left, and they need
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.800]   to fill the number 12, and so they decide that they have some parameters, that they
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.920]   need to be somebody that was with the Lord and saw his life, and was there when he was
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.160]   resurrected, and they break it down to two people, Matthias and Barsabbas.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.840]   Now both of them qualified, but now they needed to choose one, and they cast lots.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:33.000]   This is the 12th person of the apostles, who's going to have an eternal position, and yet
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.960]   it was cast by lots.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.800]   You know, you say the other 11, you say, well Jesus chose me.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.400]   Right, and you're going to eternity, and Matthias, how did you get here?
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.560]   It's like, oh they cast lots.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.560]   Jesus didn't choose you?
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.600]   It's like, well he kind of did, but through the apostles, through the lots, right?
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:58.040]   So it seems so random that a 12th person of the apostles will be chosen in that way.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.600]   But God says, again, he didn't just randomly choose anybody, he said he met the criteria,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.080]   but God chose him through the lots.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.160]   So again, my point is, on the surface it seems like nothing, it seems random, but clearly
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.360]   God has a purpose.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:18.960]   He's breaking into the darkness through this man to remind the nation of Israel that the
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.640]   Messiah is coming.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.160]   The rest of the time I want to spend on what's happening with Elizabeth.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.240]   It says in verse 6, and you really have to pay attention to this, because this is really
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.800]   the main point of what he's trying to say here.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.240]   They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.440]   and requirements of the Lord.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.440]   Let me stop right there.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.320]   Clearly he's not talking about judicially he was innocent before God.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.640]   The whole reason why Jesus came is because all have sinned and fall short of the glory
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.040]   of God.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.520]   He's saying that in their walk, just like Apostle Paul says in Philippians chapter 3,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.720]   that according to the law he was blameless.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.520]   He was perfect.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.120]   Meaning that he lived his life to fulfill the law and to obey to the best of his ability.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.760]   It doesn't mean that he was innocent before God.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.160]   The reason why I mention that is because I hear a lot of times people saying that there's
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:18.520]   nothing we can do to please God or displease God once we're justified.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.520]   No.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.960]   The Bible makes it clear.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.640]   You can live a life that displeases God.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.160]   You can live a life that honors and pleases God.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.000]   That's clear in the scripture.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.440]   And that's what he's referring to.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:42.560]   That Elizabeth and Zachariah lived an honorable law abiding to the point where God was pleased
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.680]   with them.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.200]   But the point that he's trying to make is in the commandment and requirements of the
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.360]   law, but they had no child.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   But they had no.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.320]   Why does he say it like that?
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.360]   They had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they were both advanced in years.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.880]   Now again, understand these are John the Baptist's parents.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.160]   John the Baptist was prophesied 400 years ago that before the Messiah comes, John the
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.360]   Baptist has to come.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.200]   Yet his parents couldn't bear children.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.680]   In fact, it says they were advanced in years.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:26.440]   The reason why they contrast their barrenness and their righteousness is because at that
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:33.600]   time if you had any kind of physical ailment, they attached it to some spiritual defect.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.960]   We see that clearly in John chapter 9, 1 to 3.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.640]   When they're walking by and they see a blind man, it said he saw a man blind from birth
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.880]   and his disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.040]   born blind?"
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.520]   Jesus answered, "It was neither that this man sinned nor his parents, but it was so that
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.800]   the works of God might be displayed in him."
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.400]   You see the prejudice that they had toward him?
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:05.240]   They just automatically assumed that he must be blind because he must have deserved it
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   or maybe the parents did something, they deserved it.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:15.640]   And this was a common prejudice against anybody who had some sort of a physical defect.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.040]   So I mean you could imagine like again, we live in a culture where we have all kinds
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.800]   of rules and even in the church, like the bathrooms have to be a certain height or you
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.040]   know, like you have to make the entrances a certain way and it's like all kinds of
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   stuff that somebody who's in a wheelchair could have easy access, right?
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:41.720]   I mean at this particular time, not only did they have difficulty just live, people assumed
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.400]   that they were blind.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:50.480]   How their life was like, in fact, not only did the culture view it that way, many times
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:56.640]   even the families thought that the only way to remove themselves from the curse is to
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.040]   remove that person from their own family.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.960]   And if you know the story in John chapter 9, that's exactly what happens.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.280]   After he opens his eyes, his parents wouldn't even stick up for him because they were afraid
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.200]   that they were going to be shunned by, shunned into the synagogue.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.080]   So they said, "Well, I don't know."
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.520]   They could have easily said, "Clearly he was blind all his life.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.900]   Clearly there was a miracle."
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.120]   But out of fear they said, "No, no, no.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.400]   You talk to him."
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.880]   And that was the attitude of that time.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:34.040]   So can you imagine the suffering, the shame that somebody who was barren at that time.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400]   Clearly something, something must be going on with them.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:43.920]   In fact, in the Talmud, Talmud is basically the commentaries that the rabbis created to
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.160]   interpret the law.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:56.620]   And in the Talmud, they said, "A man is no longer bound to his barren wife after 10 years
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.920]   if she does not bear a child."
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:09.640]   And he is by law, law that they created, that he can just dismiss her if she doesn't bear
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.440]   him a child in 10 years.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.080]   And he is able to do that up to two times, right?
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.040]   Sorry, third time.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.520]   I mean, so if you were barren at that time, not only do you have the pain of not being
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.120]   able to have a child, you have the law that's against you.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.800]   You have your own family that's against you.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.640]   And you have the shame that you have to live with.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.400]   So he says, "They were born, they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   blamelessness, but despite that, she couldn't have children."
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:52.560]   As painful as this must have been, God clearly has a purpose.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.640]   Just like when Lazarus was dead, he said, "This is not going to end in death.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   This is for God's glory."
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.320]   And that's exactly what he does here.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:11.400]   Just having children, bearing children, and not being able to have children, if you haven't
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.760]   experienced that, you don't know the pain that comes with that.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.280]   Now, obviously, I have four children.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:26.640]   But early on, when we first got married, Esther went through the first miscarriage.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.560]   And then I had to go through the operation, and I could see how she was devastated.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.200]   Went to the hospital and did some blood work, and they basically told her that you couldn't
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.800]   have children the normal way.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.480]   And I remember going through that, and at that time, we were pretty young.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   So my thought was, "We'll adopt it."
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.840]   Or we won't have children, and we'll have plenty of time to do ministry, go out, become
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.920]   missionaries, plant churches, visit churches to go speaking.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.860]   And so, okay, that's what I was thinking, the insensitive man.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.680]   But in the back of my mind, I said, "Oh, they actually said she has some sort of a blood
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.280]   disorder that fights pregnancy, and she can't have children the normal way."
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.360]   Well, she got pregnant a second time.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.040]   And I remember when she was pregnant, and we thought that maybe she was going to have
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.980]   another miscarriage.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.760]   And right around that time, I went up to a retreat.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.040]   And at the retreat, we had older people who were giving testimonies, and one lady who
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.360]   was about 10 years ahead of me in age, and she started sharing about her testimony.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:39.760]   And in her testimony, she said that she had five miscarriages, and she still didn't have
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.240]   a child.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.760]   And they've been married for a long time.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.280]   But what really got me was, as she was sharing that, she was starting to break down, and
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.720]   she said by the time she had her fifth miscarriage, she said, by her own words, "I no longer feel
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.600]   like a woman."
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.400]   I remember when I listened to that, my heart ached for her, but at the same time, I was
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.040]   thinking, "Is this what Esther's going through?"
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.880]   I remember I came back from that, and I didn't really share this with Esther, but I started
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.040]   going to morning prayer.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.280]   Every morning at 5 o'clock, I would go there, and that's all I prayed for during her pregnancy.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.080]   I prayed, I prayed, "Lord, please answer this prayer.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.680]   Please let her have this.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.400]   Please, please, please."
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.120]   And then, sure enough, she had her miscarriage.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:36.880]   If there's any one period in my prayer life where I was severely disappointed, it was
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   during that period.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:44.360]   I mean, there's a lot of things I prayed for a long time, but I can only think of a handful
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:50.800]   of things where I literally cried out to God and pled before God, and for several months
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.600]   prayed, "Lord, answer, answer.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.040]   May this be for your glory.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.480]   May this be for your glory."
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:02.560]   And then when she had the miscarriage, I remember thinking, "Where are you?"
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.000]   I dedicated my life.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.880]   We let go of material goods.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.720]   We're willing to suffer for your kingdom, and you won't answer this prayer?"
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.600]   And I never shared this with anybody, but I remember the disappointment that I felt
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.120]   during that period.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.680]   Third child comes along, pregnancy, and we already are thinking she's not going to have
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   this child.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.800]   She goes to the hospital, and the doctor says, "You had another miscarriage."
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.640]   And so, by that time, we've accepted it.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.520]   She's not going to be able to have children the normal way.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.360]   We didn't have enough money to think about adoption.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.520]   We were just thinking, "Well, let's see what happens."
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:54.200]   So, after that initial appointment, she came back and just lived a normal life.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.960]   And at that time, I was a youth pastor, so I remember taking the kids to Magic Mountain,
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.600]   and she rode the roller coaster and did all of that.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.320]   Didn't take any medicine, nothing.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.480]   Drank coffee, whatever you're not supposed to do, she did everything.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:14.220]   And at the end of fifth month, she just went in for a checkup, just to see, just to make
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.440]   sure that everything has been moved from the body.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.360]   And she came back, and the way she came through the door, I knew something was wrong.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.640]   And she said, "The baby's living."
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   And I thought, "What?
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.800]   They already told us that we lost him."
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:37.400]   And she came back with an ultrasound, and she's like, "Oops."
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   So we don't know.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.080]   I mean, maybe the doctor was just automatically assuming she's not going to be able to have
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.520]   a baby, so she maybe didn't examine carefully.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.600]   But whatever happened was, we've already accepted that, and we knew the emotions behind all
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   of that.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.000]   And I can tell you, each one of our kids, we had some drama behind.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.320]   And God allow us, at least emotionally, feel what it's like to possibly have a kid with
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.220]   Down syndrome.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.240]   We had another kid that we thought was premature, and was in the incubator for a couple months.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:13.400]   And then we had faith.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.480]   Each one of us, I'm not going to go into all of that, but God allowed us to feel the emotions
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.040]   behind the heartache that many parents go through in different situations.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:31.740]   But I can tell you that not being able to have a child, I understand.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:37.600]   And I know there's a lot of people in our generation that, because of this desire, there's
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:45.960]   a temptation to compromise our Christian ethics, to do things against the will of God.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   I'm not going to get into that this morning, but I want to encourage you.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.080]   Our God is sovereign.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.840]   What's happening in your life isn't by mistake.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.360]   It's not because of a satanic attack.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.120]   Trust God.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:12.800]   Whether you end up having a child or not having a child, trust God.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.520]   You know what's interesting about this story?
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:22.560]   There's major markers in how God's covenant is being fulfilled.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.840]   And each one of those markers, it comes through a barren woman.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.240]   You remember Sarah?
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.920]   Had Isaac.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.640]   She was barren.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.560]   Rebecca had Jacob.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.760]   She was barren.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.720]   Rachel had Joseph.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.240]   She was barren.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.360]   Hannah had Samuel, and she was barren.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.740]   This is not by accident.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.960]   God is trying to convey something here.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.720]   That doesn't mean that if you have a hard time having a child, that if you trust God
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.640]   that you're going to have four children.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.080]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:05.440]   But what it does mean is that our God is completely sovereign.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:11.080]   That even in the most randomest and difficult and the darkest situation, God has not lost
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.880]   control.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:20.200]   The reason why Elizabeth and this story is here, which seems random on the surface, is
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.520]   because God prophesied this.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.360]   In Isaiah 54, 1 through 8, it says, "Shout for joy, O barren one.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.040]   You who have born no child.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.960]   Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.240]   You who have not prevailed, for the sons of the desolate one will be more numerous than
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.640]   the sons of the married woman," says the Lord.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.240]   "Enlarge the place of your tent.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.960]   Stretch out the curtains of your dwelling.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   Spare not.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   Lengthen your cords and strengthen your pegs, for you will spread abroad to the right and
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.560]   to the left, and your descendants will possess nations and will resettle the desolate cities.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.240]   Fear not, for you will not be put to shame.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.280]   Do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced, but you will forget the shame of
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.640]   your youth and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more, for your husband
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:09.320]   is your maker, whose name is the Lord of hosts, and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.120]   who is called the God of all the earth.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.520]   For the Lord has called you like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even like a wife of
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.240]   one's youth when she is rejected," says your God.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.600]   "For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.380]   In an outburst of anger I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting loving
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:32.800]   kindness I will have compassion on you," says the Lord, your Redeemer.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   What seems random on the surface is not random at all.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:43.280]   When God says that He remembers every strand of hair on our head, He means it.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.200]   You know, we're in a wedding season right now.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.400]   We have almost a wedding every week.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.920]   And so I was at one yesterday and I remember just sitting around with Waller, Bree, and
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.440]   some of them that I've known for almost 20 years.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.160]   And we're thinking about how weddings used to be a long time ago, right?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.480]   15, 20 years ago when, was it 20?
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.000]   I forgot how long it was, but a while back, right?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.080]   How many years were you married, Joe?
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   18.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   So 18 years ago.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.840]   They were the first couple at our church, right?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.080]   Back then, most people did not have wedding coordinators because I was their wedding coordinator.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.000]   Because we had the whole church involved.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.440]   So whenever they got married, you know, I'd gather up the people and say, "We need to
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   shift.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.440]   Their wedding's at four.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.760]   We're going to show up at two o'clock and we're going to set up the tables and, you
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.040]   know, help serve the food."
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.920]   And then after the wedding was over, we would stay longer and clean up and we would say
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.260]   bye to them as they go and then we would stay behind and clean up for them.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.940]   It was like that in the beginning because our church was smaller.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.320]   And so every wedding was a huge celebration, right?
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   It made all of us feel like grownups, right?
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.160]   Stuck around and it's like, "Oh, they're getting married."
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.840]   And so every event, they didn't even have to send out invitations because our church
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   was small.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.800]   It was just assumed, right?
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   And so they would come.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.360]   Like a lot of college students who had no idea who they were, they would just show up
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.260]   on Saturday because they had nothing to do.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.020]   But that was all calculated into the meals and into the celebration.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.520]   So we're just reminiscing about that and how it used to be and, you know, how every celebration
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.760]   when people had hardship, we were all there together, cried together, laughed together.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.360]   But one of the difficulties now that the church is bigger, it's hard, right?
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.080]   You know, it's hard to even get to know everybody.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.000]   And so that's one of the things that happens when the church is big.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.400]   And I know there's some of you who were there like 20 years ago thinking, "Oh, you know,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.660]   only if it was like that, only when it was a long time ago."
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.000]   But obviously we're growing because God is blessing us.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.320]   There's people coming to hear the word and so greater things are happening.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.440]   But sometimes when you think about it, it is a bit sad because I know people who are
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.280]   going through hardship and can't be there for all of it.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.560]   A lot of you have gone through a lot of hardship in the last two years.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.120]   There's things that you're celebrating and we can't make it there.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.840]   Just yesterday we had two weddings on the same day.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:15.400]   As we wrestle and struggle with that, as much as I would like to be there, I am not your
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.920]   true shepherd.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.880]   I'm only an under-shepherd.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.560]   What I cannot do, God does.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.680]   God does.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:38.600]   Whether you are 50, 500, 1,000, or 10,000, or a billion, our God is sovereign and He
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.080]   cares.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:48.040]   Even for a barren woman in her old age, even for this old couple who may have lost all
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:59.240]   hope, that as He comes to save the world, He comes to this couple who would have no
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.840]   other hope than the love of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:10.120]   That's the sympathetic high priest that we love, that we worship.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:15.840]   And so as we continue to study the book of Luke, as I mentioned, as His humanity is presented
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:23.080]   to us, as His compassion we're able to see up close, that you would remember, He says,
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.520]   we have a high priest who sympathizes with our weaknesses.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.200]   Therefore come to the throne of grace.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:38.000]   Enter the throne with confidence to seek help in time of need.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.800]   My prayer is that we would know this Jesus.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.560]   That God would not just be some figurehead, some power up above who created the universe
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.200]   and just kind of disappeared from the background that we worship from a distance, but that
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:55.040]   we would see His love for us, that we would desire more than anything else to be near
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.000]   to this Jesus.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.680]   Let's pray.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:06.040]   God, what an awesome God you are.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:17.360]   Lord, as we remember that you remembered Zacharias and Elizabeth, countless number of people
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:28.640]   who came before them, countless number of hurting and aching souls that came after them,
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   all reminding us that you care for us, that you love us, that we are not insignificant
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.160]   in your sight.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   We pray, Father God, that you would soften our hearts, help us to see our sympathetic
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:54.280]   high priest, that we would love him as he loves us, that we would worship him as he
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   deserves.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.640]   May Christ and Christ alone be magnified.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
