[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 15, 32-33.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.640]   Peter already read it, but I want to just review it to make sure that you know the text
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   that we're going to be on today.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.440]   Romans chapter 15, 32-33, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.640]   I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800]   with me in your prayers to God for me, that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.320]   in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints, so that
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.720]   I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.200]   Now the God of peace be with you all.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   Amen.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   That's great.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.840]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the many blessings that you've given us in our lives.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.040]   We thank you for the freedom that we have to be able to gather and worship you without
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.360]   concern of physical safety.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.160]   We know, Father God, that we are tremendously blessed to be able to gather together, to
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.000]   have your word, to have fellowship among brothers.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.840]   Help us, Lord God, to fill our hearts with gratitude that our worship truly may be in
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.600]   spirit and in truth.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.120]   May your word and your word alone go forth.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.240]   Amen.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.960]   You know, one of the observations that I've had throughout the years just working with
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:36.400]   just various people that as the years go by, I'm more and more convinced the power of the
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.760]   community that we belong to.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.320]   And I'm not simply just talking about Christianity.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.360]   You know, whatever decade you grew up in, the impact that was made in our lives, it
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.120]   just gets impacted and it just kind of stays with you for a long, long period of time.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.000]   So you know, even the kind of music that we kind of lean toward, a lot of that depends
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   on what decade you grew up in as a teenager.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Right?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.600]   So I grew up in the, you know, in the late 70s and early 80s as a teenager.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.400]   And so whenever I hear music from that generation, like a lot of endorphins get released and
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.800]   I have a lot of fond memories during that time.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.600]   So even now, every other music past that generation sounds like trash to me, you know.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.320]   But whenever I hear the music from the 80s, right, so you guys who are from different
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.920]   generation may differ with me.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.480]   But even fashion, right, certain things that was so cool a decade later is so weird.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.680]   And certain things that you guys in your 30s, you thought you were so cool in your 20s,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.780]   it's all corny now already, right?
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.560]   And then the people who are younger, whatever generation you are in, whatever period that
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   you were teenagers, and we don't do this consciously.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.520]   It just, that's the generation that we were in and that happened to be the fashion, it
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.680]   had to be the culture and without making a conscious choice, it happened.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.000]   Like why certain hairstyles look better to you than other hairstyles, why certain genes
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.320]   have to be tighter than the previous generation, I don't know.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.560]   But these things are done without thinking because you're being influenced by whatever
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.680]   is surrounding you.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.720]   Now all of this to say that we have to be very, very cautious that our faith in God
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.240]   isn't simply a reflection of the community that we belong to.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.360]   That we have to be careful that just because you were born in a Christian home, you were
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.520]   raised in a church, or you went to church all your life, and that we learned how to
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   conform to that.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.160]   And a lot of times we're not even thinking, like, am I doing this because this is my community
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.480]   and these are my friends and this is my family?
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.960]   How much of this is a real faith that's driving us?
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.560]   And again, you don't need to make a conscious choice, it just happens.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.500]   Just like why certain hairstyles, why certain music, why certain fashion seemed better to
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.160]   you than the previous generation after that.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.080]   In the same way, like why certain things are more important to you in this generation maybe
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.440]   than the previous generation of Christians or prior to that.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.640]   Is it the Word of God and the Spirit of God that is conforming and changing us, or is
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.200]   it just happens that that's kind of like the culture, that's the age that we live in?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.560]   If we're not careful, we can easily succumb to conforming rather than being transformed.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.580]   In Romans chapter 12 too, it said, "not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.580]   of our mind."
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.720]   So is our mind being renewed by His Word?
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.460]   And are our hearts and what we value being transformed by the things of God?
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440]   Or are we just conforming because that just happens to be the generation that we're in?
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.760]   And if that is the case, Jesus' greatest rebuke were to the Pharisees who said, "You are like
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.540]   whitewashed tombs where on the external, on the outside, you know how to be religious,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.460]   you know how to be good, but inwardly, there was never any kind of transformation taking
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.340]   place."
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.800]   I've known plenty of people who are very disciplined in their walk with God.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.520]   They read their scriptures every single day.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.660]   I've known people, I've had people in my life where they woke up every morning from 5 to
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.940]   6.30, every single morning, six days a week, prayed fervently, at least what it seemed
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.240]   like from the surface.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.380]   I've known people who are very generous in the church.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:29.600]   On the outside, they had all the indicators that may look like that they were great Christians,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.160]   and yet their hearts were filled with bitterness and anger and splendor.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.700]   And every time you have an opportunity to sit down and talk with them, all you hear
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.580]   about what is going wrong and how they are wronged by everybody and anybody.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.160]   And their hearts are filled and all you hear is over and over again, those things.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.180]   If we're not careful, we can allow just the external, we're just conforming to what's
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.420]   going on, but there's no real transformation taking place.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.300]   The reason why this is so important is because Paul has been preaching the gospel and he's
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:08.180]   ending this letter at the end of chapter 15, asking them, urging them to pray, to agonize
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.380]   in prayer together.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.840]   And he said, we talked about last week, how the prayer has to be motivated and moved according
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.340]   to the will of God.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.940]   He's asked for prayer by the Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.740]   So we talked about last week how our prayers have to conform to God's will.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.260]   You can't just come to God with a wish list and say, these are things that I desire of
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.580]   God.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.540]   And part of the reason why sometimes our prayers are so ineffective is because we've never
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.740]   made up our mind that Christ was going to be Lord over our lives.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.620]   That Christ is Lord on Sunday, Christ is Lord at church, but he's not Lord over all of our
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   lives.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.780]   So we're still continuing to pursue the passions of this world and then we just kind of fit
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.460]   in Jesus in between.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.460]   And then one of the first places where that gets revealed is in our prayer life, because
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.540]   we can't pray according to his will.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.900]   We talked about that last week.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.180]   But the second part that he says, he says not only according to his will, the Lordship
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.980]   of Christ, but according to the love of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:19.940]   People appeal that even in our prayers, it has to be in line with the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.820]   There are things that you just cannot do if your heart is not engaged.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.940]   And one of the primary things that you can't do, I mean worship, right?
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.460]   There's a huge difference, and you know as well as I do, there's a huge difference between
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.420]   singing and worshiping.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.940]   You can come in here and open your mouth and sing songs, because you like singing, you
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.500]   like the beat, you like the music, you like being in a room filled with people doing the
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.740]   same thing, but all it is is singing.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.380]   And there is a huge difference between singing and worshiping.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.060]   Worship is not something you can do when your heart is not engaged.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.620]   And prayer is no different.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.860]   Prayer is not something that you can do when all it is is just a bunch of things that you
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.340]   should say to God, and then you just repeated these phrases and you just happen to say it
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.020]   to God.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.140]   Because prayer ultimately is petitioning God.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:25.260]   But in petitioning God, if your heart is not engaged, those prayers are going to be empty.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.940]   It's no different than if a child asks for something, but they don't really care if you
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.980]   give it to them or not.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.820]   You don't jump for that, you don't sacrifice for that, you don't pour any energy into that.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.740]   So Paul says, according to his will, according to the love of the Holy Spirit, in Galatians
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.900]   5.22, the fruit of the Spirit is love.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.180]   He says joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and faithfulness, they're all kind of interconnected,
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.020]   but the first thing that he mentions of the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.140]   And as you know, in the New Testament, whenever you see a list of things and you see the first
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.980]   thing that on that list, that it is not there randomly.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.180]   When we make a list of things that we like, we have to say, well, first I like this, and
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.140]   second I like this, third I like this.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.340]   In the New Testament culture, whenever they wrote it, it was assumed that first, second,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.860]   third, without saying it, was there for that purpose.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.180]   That's why Apostle Peter was always on the top of the list of the apostles, because he
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.620]   was the leader among the apostles.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.380]   He was the most influential among the apostles, at least the first 12.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.420]   So when it says the first fruit of the Spirit is love, the first evidence that the Holy
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.300]   Spirit is indwelling in you is love.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.240]   The first evidence that you are walking in the Spirit is love.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.340]   The true evidence that you are walking right with God, that you are spiritually mature,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.820]   is not discipline, even though that's important.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.620]   It's not your Bible knowledge, even though that is important and it's crucial.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.180]   First and foremost, he says, is love.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.500]   That's how you know when somebody met Christ.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.860]   That's what he means when he says the fruit of the Spirit is love.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:13.820]   So therefore, even our prayers to be effective, he says, it must be by love.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.260]   Second Corinthians 5.13, "For if we are besides ourselves, it is for God.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.220]   If we are of sound mind, it is for you.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.820]   For the love of Christ controls us.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.020]   Having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all die."
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:33.420]   The word for control in some of your translations says to compel, or in some of your other translations
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.580]   it says to constrain.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.320]   Paul is writing to this Corinthians church, his second letter, a very difficult letter
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.980]   because he is wrestling with this church because they didn't like what Paul had to say.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.220]   They were questioning his apostleship, that maybe some of these things that he's saying,
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.740]   like they don't want to hear.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.740]   And so he's literally wrestling with them in these two books.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.940]   And when he says the reason why he is enduring, and he's not shaking off the dust and moving
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.780]   on, he says it's because the love of Christ controls him.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.820]   It compels him.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.860]   It constrains him.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.300]   It's motivating him.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.340]   He's not just saying this kind of passively.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:20.220]   He's concluding that the root of why he keeps doing what he's doing, despite the hardship,
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.340]   heartache, the many tears that he must have shed in particular for this church, he said
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.300]   it's because of the love of Christ.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.660]   It's because of what Christ has done for him and why he does what he does for them.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.840]   We see that even with Jesus.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:45.900]   If you take compassion out of the gospel, the gospel makes absolutely no sense.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.820]   Why would a holy God care about us?
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.180]   I mean, think about it.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:00.780]   I mean, if you're driving on the road and if you ever see a roadkill, you know, you
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.100]   ever see a roadkill, a squirrel, a possum, you look at that and maybe some of you, oh,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.500]   you're squeamish, you know, like, oh my gosh, that's disgusting.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.500]   When's the last time you had compassion?
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.420]   You know, when's the last time you thought about the possum's parents?
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.740]   I wonder if his brother and sister is looking for him.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.740]   Look what happened.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.740]   Like, when do you feel compassion for that possum?
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.420]   You say, ew, get that off the road.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.180]   I don't want to see it anymore.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.380]   Why does God have compassion for us?
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:37.100]   What is it that we have that motivated him, moved him to send his only begotten son to
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.020]   take our place of punishment?
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.420]   In Matthew 9, 36, Jesus, seeing his people, felt compassion for them because they were
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.140]   distressed and dispersed like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.180]   And in conclusion, he said, therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out more workers.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.100]   So what motivated him?
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.080]   What compelled him?
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.100]   And then compelled him to tell his disciples to pray?
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.300]   He says compassion.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.300]   He felt compassion.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.420]   The word compassion literally in the Greek means to have your bowels moved.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.180]   Now, in the English, that means something else, right?
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.580]   So it's like, well, it was a bowel movement that caused, you know, the gospel to happen.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:22.740]   But the better understanding of that in our context, if you've ever had news that was
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.820]   so gut-wrenching that you felt like what?
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.100]   You got punched in the what?
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   The gut.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.740]   Punched in the bowel.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.100]   It was so strong.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.980]   It made me cause you to be nauseous.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.980]   That's how strong that emotion was.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.980]   Whatever it was.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   It was maybe anger.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.060]   It was sadness.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.820]   Whatever it was, it was an emotion that you could not control.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.420]   That's the word that is being used here.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.500]   When Jesus saw the multitudes, it felt like it went punched in the gut.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.780]   And then he turned to his disciples, I have compassion for them.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.100]   And you ought to beseech the Lord of the harvest.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.940]   And the word beseech isn't simply to ask and pray.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.340]   It means to beg.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340]   To beg.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.140]   Come before the Lord and beg for more workers to come and help with this work.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.940]   That's what Paul is asking here to be compelled by the love of the Holy Spirit to pray for
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.620]   this gospel ministry.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.980]   Matthew chapter 14, 14.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.820]   When he went ashore and saw the great crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   sick.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.020]   Matthew 15, 32.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.660]   Jesus called his disciples to him and said, I have compassion on the crowd because they
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.980]   have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.900]   Over and over again, the scripture says Jesus was moved because of compassion.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.980]   We see it with the leopards.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.300]   We see it with the demon possessed.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.680]   We see it with the widows and their son.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.280]   We see it with the two blind men.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.140]   Over and over again in the New Testament, the word compassion is used to describe God's
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.760]   motivation behind why he did what he did.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:03.740]   So everything that we sing, every Bible study that we have, every endeavor of the church,
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.380]   if you take compassion out, it makes no sense.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:17.900]   Part of the reason why evangelism is so weak in our generation, I don't believe it's
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.900]   because of lack of training.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.420]   They say, oh, you know, we're not being trained, so therefore we're not evangelizing.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.760]   If we just had more training, we would be doing more evangelism.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.220]   Or maybe if we had more opportunity, and if I was living in China or certain places of
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.820]   the world, I would do more evangelism.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   In the end, much of the lack of evangelism in our generation is because of lack of compassion.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:50.740]   Because we see the lost who do not know Christ, and it does not move us.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.380]   We believe theoretically and theologically that all have sinned and fall short of the
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.380]   glory of God.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:02.700]   The wrath of God is being revealed, the wickedness of all mankind.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.700]   It has much as a point for all men to die.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.620]   After this comes judgment.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.320]   These are in the scriptures, repeated over and over again.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.420]   These are songs that we sing.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.360]   This is a Bible study that we have.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.060]   And yet when we see the lost and we live among them on a day-to-day basis, it does not move
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.860]   us.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:30.380]   When we are moved with compassion, we will find a way to get trained.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.060]   We have videos online.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.060]   We have other people.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.780]   We can get on campus and say, "I'm not evangelizing because we don't have a program.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.200]   We don't have a designated time.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.700]   We don't have the proper training."
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.940]   All of that is a smoke screen for a lack of compassion in us.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.720]   If we had compassion, we would move because that's exactly what moved Christ.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.700]   And that's why he says to pray, pray for this gospel ministry by the will of the Lord
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.260]   Jesus Christ and by the love of the Holy Spirit, to pray.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.660]   The opposite of compassion is to be callous.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.620]   The synonyms of callousness is to be cauterized, to have thick skin, to be hardened, insensitive,
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:18.140]   deadened in feeling, indifference to suffering, cold-blooded, emotionally hardened.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.280]   In every way, all of these things affect the way that we pray.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.780]   Just like we can't worship when our hearts have become hardened.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.460]   You can't fake that.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.060]   You can't fake coming in here and worshiping God and raising your hands and being emotional
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.020]   and trying to milk moisture out of your eyes.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.500]   You just can't fake that.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.160]   Neither can you in prayer.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.980]   If our hearts have become hardened toward the things of God, what causes you to be desperate
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.860]   is not you say, "You know what, I'm going to be desperate now in my prayer.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.820]   I'm going to force myself to have a sense of urgency."
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:02.820]   Over and over again, the scripture describes unbelief as to being hardened.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.180]   Second Corinthians 3.14, it says, "But their minds were hardened, for to this day, when
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.980]   they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted because only through Christ
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.980]   is it taken away."
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.260]   You know, we typically think, especially in a Bible teaching church, that only if we had
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.140]   more knowledge, only if we had more teaching, only if we had more theology, because our
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.620]   hearts have become corrupted.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.060]   The Bible says not to trust it.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.140]   It is deceitful.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.260]   But our mind, if we can engage our mind in theology, if we can engage our mind in proper
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.420]   teaching, then we'd be much better off.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:47.340]   But the Bible says that even your mind can become hardened until the Spirit of Christ
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.220]   transforms and renews and revives us, that even our understanding of theology and right
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:57.100]   and wrong can become hardened because it is spiritually discerned.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:03.780]   A spiritually discerning mind isn't simply a mind that has read more books and has done
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.660]   more Bible study.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:13.620]   A soft mind, soft heart, and soft life is an individual who has been deeply convicted
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.780]   and moved and compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.420]   Hebrews 3.13, "But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.840]   of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.820]   What hardens us?
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.820]   It can be neglect.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.340]   It can be compromise.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.980]   In this particular passage, it says sin.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.620]   If you get in the habit of sinning and repenting and sinning and repenting and sinning and
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:47.020]   repenting, we may say, "Of course, God says, you know, God will forgive seven times seventy."
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.700]   But just like an arm that's been broken over and over and over again, it becomes weaker
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.700]   and weaker.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:59.860]   In a life that sees sin as something that is not utterly sinful, eventually it hardens
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.780]   our own heart.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.260]   And though we repent and though we receive forgiveness, our hearts become harder and
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.780]   harder and harder, and we become more and more callous.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.900]   And so what happens is we start to engage our body without engaging our mind or our
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.900]   heart.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.540]   And we're no longer moved.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:24.420]   When was the last time you really wept for lost souls?
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.340]   Think about the things that bother us, emotionally move us, and things that consume your mind.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.560]   How much of that are eternal stuff?
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.820]   How much are these things that are, whether you get it or don't get it, it just makes
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.540]   your life a little bit easier?
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:46.860]   How much of our crying out before God are things that have eternal consequences?
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.180]   Matthew chapter 24, verse 12, Jesus says at the end, "And because of lawlessness will
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.620]   be increased, the love of many will grow cold."
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.940]   What does it mean to grow cold?
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.140]   To become callous.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.380]   To become hardened.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.500]   Because sin and unrighteousness has become a normal part of our culture, sometimes even
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.540]   inside the church, the first thing that you see is a hardened heart.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.460]   When you have a hardened heart, it affects the worship and it affects our prayer.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:27.180]   That's why Paul says to pray by the love of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:33.700]   Until the love of Christ compels us, you will never pray for the lost.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:39.700]   Until the love of Christ compels us, it affects everything that, it affects our worship, it
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.100]   affects our fellowship, it affects our Bible study.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:50.500]   You can be disciplined, you can engage in all the religious activities and be an A student
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:57.340]   and everything that you're doing, but until your heart is broken because of what Christ
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.940]   has done for you, and until you recognize the brokenness of Christ's heart for the
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:08.780]   lost, your worship will always be superficial.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.260]   Your prayers will be offered up but never with any kind of urgency.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.420]   If not today, next month, if not next month, next year, if not next month, maybe next decade,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.740]   the next thing you know you wake up, 20, 30, 40 years have gone by and you think that that
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.020]   is normal Christianity and it is not.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.420]   It contradicts everything that we see in Scripture.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.980]   It contradicts what we see in Paul's life.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:35.620]   It contradicts the command that he gives to the New Testament.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.500]   You know what's interesting is, Paul says to pray by the love of the Holy Spirit, the
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:49.260]   opposite of that, the love of Christ, is callousness, but the two things that he prays for here
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:54.620]   is for his own protection in order that he may continue to be fruitful in the Gospel.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.740]   Those are the two things that he prays for.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.660]   You know what's interesting is the first thing that he says of them, he said, "Prayers to
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.220]   God for me that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea."
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.900]   The word for disobedient here in Greek, and you're going to be able to recognize this
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.380]   in English, is apetheo.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.780]   What does that sound like?
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.780]   Apathy.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:24.300]   It's interesting that he uses the word to pray by the love of the Holy Spirit and not
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.540]   in apathy, and he describes those who are persecuting him are those who have hardened
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.020]   their hearts against God.
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:38.420]   To protect them from these people who have chosen to be apathetic, chosen to be obstinate
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:46.980]   against God, unpersuadable by the things of God, because they've committed themselves
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:53.300]   for themselves, and as a result of that, they live unrepentant lives.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.620]   Imagine Apostle Paul.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:02.340]   Before he met Christ, he thought beating Christians was God's work.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.060]   He was responsible for the death of the first martyr in the New Testament, and all the while
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.660]   thinking that he's doing God a favor.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.940]   That's how hardened his heart was toward God.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.020]   These Jews obeyed the commandment of God.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.740]   They kept the Sabbath.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:25.540]   They made sure that every part of the law was obeyed meticulously, all the while thinking
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.860]   that they're moving up in this ladder of righteousness, and yet when the very Messiah
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:36.460]   that they've been waiting for and praying for for hundreds of years was standing right
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:43.220]   in front of them, not only did they not recognize him, they ended up crucifying him.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:48.740]   That's how hardened their hearts were.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:55.900]   We can easily be susceptible to a hardened heart, or we can be in the church all our
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:03.180]   lives, 30, 40, 50, 60 years, singing the songs, doing the Bible study, maybe even participating
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:11.060]   in short-term missions, maybe even leading worship, maybe even as a pastor, and yet never
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:17.860]   knowing and being compelled by the love of Christ, because that's how deceitful sin
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:26.540]   is when we are at the center and Christ is not the king.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.220]   He prays for protection, but the prayer for protection wasn't simply because Paul was
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.220]   afraid.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:37.260]   You know, typically when we pray for protection, it's because we just don't want to be hurt.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.540]   We don't want to be uncomfortable.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.260]   We don't want to get sick.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.020]   And so in this journey of doing whatever we're doing, we're praying for protection, we're
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.980]   praying that we won't be persecuted so that we can have an easy, comfortable life.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.820]   Paul's prayer for protection wasn't that.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.900]   Paul was praying for protection so that he may continue the gospel ministry.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.780]   Think about what he was praying for.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:07.980]   The gospel message was very offensive, so it was no surprise why they wanted to get
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.140]   rid of him, because the more popular he got, the more the gospel started messing up even
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.220]   their economy.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.700]   People started destroying the idols and the whole economy was based upon selling idols.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.620]   And so the more popular this gospel message got, it ruined them.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.620]   It ruined their family.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.580]   It ruined their idols.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:32.440]   Jesus was a very popular man until he began to call out the sins of the leaders of Israel.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.580]   If you remember the gospel account, the first half, first about half a year of his ministry,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.740]   and he began to perform miracles, people were traveling days.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.140]   These are Pharisees, Sadducees.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.420]   I don't know if they got on horses or they walked or I don't know how they got there,
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:54.120]   but they traveled about two days distance to come to Jesus because they thought maybe
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.860]   he's the Messiah.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.860]   So they didn't hate him.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.260]   They wanted to be near him.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.220]   It wasn't until Jesus saw them coming and he began to call them out, "Bear fruit in
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.780]   accordance with your repentance."
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.060]   That's how the book of Romans begins.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.620]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.720]   Those who are under the law are condemned under the law.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.220]   Those who are outside the law are condemned outside the law.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:23.900]   So the core of the gospel message is to bring a sinner and recognizing his sin and to repent
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.020]   and submit to God.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.360]   That's at the core of the gospel message.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.280]   So Jesus says, "They do not want that."
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.220]   Those who reject him, they reject his lordship.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.560]   They reject the fact that he calls them to repentance.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.200]   They reject the fact that he says that they are wretched and poor and blind and they need
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   the forgiveness of Christ.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.960]   He said, "Why do we need all that?
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.200]   We were children of Abraham."
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.600]   So when he began to call them out from their sins and call them from repentance, to turn
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.120]   from their wicked ways, that's when they turned against him and they eventually crucified
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   him.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:06.160]   And then Jesus said to his disciples, "If you follow me and you proclaim the same message
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.480]   as they hated me, they will hate you."
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   So Paul takes up his cross, Peter and the apostles take up their cross, and every single
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.200]   one of them who preached the gospel met the same fate as Jesus.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.660]   Not everybody was crucified, but everybody was persecuted.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:33.160]   What is strange in our generation is that we have so-called gospel proclamation and
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.200]   yet nobody is offended.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.560]   And I'm not talking about being jerks.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.960]   I'm not talking about walking around saying, "Hey, you're going to go to hell.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.480]   You're going to go to hell," and showing no compassion for the lost.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.840]   But when we are surrounded by people in our lives and say, "Hey, good.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.880]   You know, you're such a good guy.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   You're a Christian.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.920]   You're so generous and you're so kind and you're so patient."
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.920]   Great.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:01.960]   I mean, if you take the preaching of the gospel out of Christianity, who wouldn't want to
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.400]   be around Christians?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.960]   Because we're called to turn the other cheek.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.800]   We're called to feed the poor.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.480]   We're called not to slander, not to commit adultery.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.840]   When I was a youth pastor, I had, you know, like a youth group filled with kids that parents
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   dropped off.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.000]   And parents don't come to church, but they would drop off their kids because they wanted
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.080]   to be good kids.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   Some of them were doing drugs and the parents said, "We have to send them to church and
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.000]   hopefully you can fix them."
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.960]   But as soon as they started really committing their life to Christ and they say, "You know
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   what?
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.080]   Maybe I want to go into ministry," and the parents would turn and get angry with me.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.560]   If you take the preaching of the gospel out of Christianity, who wouldn't want to be around
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.800]   Christians?
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:52.080]   I remember, you know, years back, you know, I had to supplement my income as a car detailer.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.320]   I had no idea what I was doing, but I did it because people wanted to pay me, so I did
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   it.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.880]   So I made these little cards and I put it in people's cars and I said, "For $30, I'll
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.360]   come and detail your car," right?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.760]   And I survived like that for about a year.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.640]   But I remember thinking, like, I have to come up with a name.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.280]   And so the first idea that I had was, you know, I want people to know that they can
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.120]   trust me because literally they're handing me their car.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.160]   You know, some of these cars are like $70,000 car and I walk in, they just give me their
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.840]   car key and I walk out.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.600]   And these people are crazy.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   They don't know who I am.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.800]   They just saw a little sign that I put on their car.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.680]   So I thought, I need to come up with this name.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:37.160]   The first thought that I had was I was going to put "Integrity Car Detailing" so that
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.600]   they can trust me, right?
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.160]   So I remember thinking that that's what I was going to call my car detailing, you know,
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   business.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.800]   And I went to the Yellow Page to see, you know, Yellow Page.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.120]   Some of you guys don't know what Yellow Page is, right?
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   It's a book that was yellow.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.840]   It had a lot of phone numbers, okay?
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   So I went there to see.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.680]   That's where people would advertise and put their business name.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.800]   And I would go in there to look auto detailing.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.160]   And I had a list of integrity.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.200]   Everybody had the same idea.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.240]   Integrity plumbing, integrity roofing, integrity landscaping.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.360]   And everybody had the same idea because, you know, like you want to tell people, "Hey,
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.600]   you can trust me."
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.040]   Who wouldn't want to be around good Christians who are living with integrity, who's not going
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.600]   to lie, who's not going to cheat you?
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.280]   You know, they're going to turn you on the cheek.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   They're not slandering.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   They're generous.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.280]   They're sharing.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.960]   They're good neighbors.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.340]   Why would they hate you?
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.140]   Why would they persecute you?
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.760]   The reason why the persecution came is because Paul was consumed with preaching the gospel
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.680]   where the gospel was not preached.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.920]   He was determined to go and shake up the ground, shake up the economy, shake up the families,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   and to tell them that the path that you are on leads to condemnation until you turn and
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.600]   repent.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   That's why they hated Jesus, and that's why they hated Paul, and that's why the Bible
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.520]   says they will hate us.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.880]   Even if you're meek, even if you're patient, even if you're one of the most kindest people
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.000]   in the world, it's the message itself is offensive to this world.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.880]   Unless they believe and repent.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.560]   Paul was not simply asking for safety and comfort.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.440]   He was asking that he would be able to continue to preach the gospel.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.160]   I'm going to ask you guys to turn your Bibles to Acts chapter 20.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:39.080]   For the remaining about 10 minutes, I want to show you how God answered Paul's prayer.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.720]   Paul prayed for protection.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.600]   Paul prayed that he may be able to come to Rome.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.240]   He prayed that he may be able to bear fruit while he is there.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.880]   I want you to see how God answers this prayer.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.000]   It took me almost three and a half, four years to finish 16 chapters of the book of Romans.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   We're not done yet.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   We're almost there.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.120]   I'm going to go through eight chapters in 10 minutes in the book of Acts.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.880]   Chapter 20, Paul is at the end of his third missionary journey and he's about to head
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.160]   back to Jerusalem.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:19.700]   People are beginning to say, "If you go to Jerusalem, you become famous enough that they're
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.040]   waiting for you."
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.480]   Paul tells this church of Ephesus that he had a really close tie with and he spends
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.440]   all night praying with them, thinking that he may never see them again.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.680]   He chooses to go.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.440]   Then chapter 21 is when he begins to set sail.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.880]   He says, "I'm ready to go.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.400]   I don't know, whatever's going to happen in Jerusalem, let it happen.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   I'm going to come.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.400]   I'm going to preach the gospel.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   That's my plan."
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.580]   He gets to Jerusalem, chapter 21, and starting from verse 15, he goes straight to the temple
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.840]   in verse 27.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.760]   Now you remember Jesus, when he was going to the cross, one of the first things that
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.640]   he did on the last week of his life after he comes into Jerusalem, he goes straight
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   to the temple.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.840]   The reason why he goes to the temple is because that's the epicenter of the Jewish leadership.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   Jesus was basically getting things rolling because he was headed straight to the cross
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.960]   and he knew that he was going to be crucified by the hands of the leaders of Israel.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.180]   In order to get their attention, he goes straight to the temple and he begins to challenge the
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:29.560]   teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes at the temple itself.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.760]   Paul does the exact same thing.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.640]   He goes to Jerusalem, he goes straight to the temple, and he begins to preach the gospel.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.920]   After he begins to preach the gospel, sure enough, they get stirred up and they get angry
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   with him.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.360]   Verse 30, it says, "All the city was provoked."
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:50.160]   I'm sure Apostle Paul and his companions were not surprised by that because that's exactly
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.440]   what happened to Jesus.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   But look what happens in verse 31.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.920]   "While they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.680]   that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.320]   At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them, and when they saw the
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.760]   commander and soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.640]   So who comes to rescue him?
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.520]   The Roman soldiers.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.920]   So starting from chapter 21 all the way to chapter 28, Apostle Paul is under the protection
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.480]   of the Roman guards.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:30.120]   Maybe he's in prison, but throughout the whole time, until he gets to Rome and preach
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:36.800]   the gospel, the reason why he lives is because the Roman guards are there protecting him.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   I don't know.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.080]   In my mind, I don't think when Paul prayed, "Pray for my protection," he said, "Can you
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.640]   pray that the Roman guards would come and protect me?"
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.020]   I'm sure he didn't have that in mind.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.240]   Maybe he was thinking angels.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.680]   Maybe he was thinking like splitting of waters.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.480]   Maybe something supernatural.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.560]   But the Roman guards became protective.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.480]   Chapter 21.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.260]   So they guard him.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.040]   They start removing him from the scene because this mob wants to kill him.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.520]   But Paul says in chapter 21, verse 37, he says, "You know what?
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.840]   Before I go, let me address the crowd."
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.400]   It's like, "What?"
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   "Yeah.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.520]   Now that I'm safe, now that they can't beat me because you're here, can I talk to them
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   one more time?"
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.480]   And then in chapter 22, he turns around and he begins to address them.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   And guess what he does?
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   He doesn't sit there.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.560]   He's like, "How dare you beat me?"
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   He turns around.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   He's like, "I know why you're angry."
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:37.260]   And then he preaches the gospel again to this angry mob.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:42.800]   And because of that, obviously, they are stirred up and they are enraged.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.920]   And now, if they wanted to kill him before, now like, "We got to get rid of this guy."
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.800]   They wanted to kill him.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.040]   And then the Roman guards step in.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.640]   They protect him.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   And they say, "You know what?
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.240]   Let's beat him a little bit, at least to appease the crowd because they want to kill him.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.220]   But at least if they know that if we're going to take care of him, then maybe it'll kind
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.880]   of diffuse some of the anger."
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.280]   So they start to beat him.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.200]   And Paul says in chapter 22, verse 27, "Is it right for you to beat a Roman like this
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.600]   without a fair trial?"
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.800]   And they freak out.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.320]   "You're a Roman citizen?"
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.760]   And he says, "I got my Roman citizen.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760]   I purchased it.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   How did you get it?"
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.200]   He said, "My father was a citizen, so I was born into it."
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.120]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, yours is legitimate.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.840]   If we keep beating him, we're going to get in trouble."
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   So they actually back off.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.240]   They actually back off.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.320]   And then they, again, we can't treat him like this.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.520]   And then so they decide, "You know what?
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.460]   Maybe, you know, how do we diffuse this situation?"
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.160]   So we don't want the responsibility with this guy.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.000]   So let's take him to the council.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.080]   Let's take him to the leaders of Israel.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.760]   So chapter 23, they take him to the council of Israel.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.600]   These are the same people who crucified Jesus.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.100]   He's standing before the high priest.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.280]   And then he stands there before the same people made the decision to kill Jesus.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.960]   The Roman guards, to diffuse the situation, and whatever happens to him, like it's out
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.800]   of our hands, Peter stands before, and Paul stands before him, guess what he does?
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.880]   He preaches the gospel.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.040]   He begins to preach, and he says, "I'm here because of the hope that I have for the resurrection."
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.000]   Well, which resurrection is he talking about?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.120]   The one that you killed.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.480]   The one that you paid money to the Roman guards to keep their mouths shut.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.120]   The one that you threatened in the beginning of the book of Acts, saying that if you keep
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.160]   doing this, you're going to be beaten.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.800]   In front of those same people, he turns around and he begins to preach the gospel.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.680]   And as a result of that, he stirs them up even more.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.840]   So each chapter, their anger for him is just being stirred up.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.080]   "Oh my God, he's going to preach again?
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   How dare he?"
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:00.760]   By the time you get to chapter 23, verse 12, "So when it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.080]   and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.400]   they had killed Paul."
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.600]   That's how determined they were.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   They made a vow.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.360]   And it says, verse 13, there was about 40 of them.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.120]   Every time I read this, I chuckle because I think about what happened to these people
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.320]   because it doesn't tell us.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.340]   Because Paul clearly doesn't die.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.120]   They say they weren't going to eat or drink, and I'm thinking, how long did it take before
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.340]   the first guy decides that he was going to eat the matzah?
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.200]   And I can imagine maybe three days.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.280]   "I'm still thirsty.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.520]   Maybe that was a rash vow."
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.960]   And then some of the hardcore is like, "How dare you?
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   We made a vow."
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.640]   And then the first guy just kind of like, "I don't feel so good.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.960]   I think I got a cold.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   My mom is sick."
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.080]   So I can imagine the first few guys, they had some excuse, they went back home, and
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.960]   then the hardcore guys, "No."
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.560]   Four days, five days go by, and they're all...
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.040]   Anyway, I could just milk this forever, but it just, in my mind, it's very comedic because
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.400]   it doesn't tell us what happened.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.220]   And I don't think they starved to death.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.240]   At some point, I have a feeling they start eating.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.760]   It's like, "Ah, maybe we're a little bit too rash.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   Maybe Jesus isn't that bad.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   Let's go home."
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.360]   They find out their conspiracy.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.120]   They go and tell the leaders.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.720]   And then, and this, look at what happens.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:37.120]   Chapter 23, verse 23, "As a result of this vow, he called to him two of the centurions
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:43.080]   and said, 'Get 200 soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea with
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.520]   70 horses and 200 spearmen.'"
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:58.880]   200 Roman guards with horses and spears, God sends to protect this guy, this guy that they
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.480]   wanted to kill, right?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.840]   And he said, "Pray for protection."
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   200 soldiers.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.880]   Now, they don't know that.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.400]   They don't know that this is God answering prayer.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.160]   They don't know that this is what Paul is praying, right?
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.040]   So from this moment on, 200 soldiers are attached to Apostle Paul, and no matter where he goes,
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.720]   now he can preach the gospel because physically he's protected.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.860]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   They move him along.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.280]   They take him to the governor, Governor Felix, and he stands before the governor.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.600]   And instead of pleading his case, he just says, and he begins to preach the gospel.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.400]   He said, "I don't understand this guy.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.200]   This guy, people are trying to kill this guy.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.400]   We need 200 men to protect him, and he just won't relent."
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.280]   So he doesn't know what to do with him.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.360]   So as a result, he just keeps him in prison for two years.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.480]   And the two years that he's there, he's writing letters, he's meeting with people, he's preaching
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.320]   to the guards, and he's still continuing to do gospel ministry.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.480]   And he says, and as a result of his imprisonment, he says, "Many other brothers have become
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.840]   emboldened, and now they're beginning to preach the gospel everywhere because of his imprisonment."
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.640]   I mean, I told you he was obsessed.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.000]   This man was obsessed.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.800]   They keep him in prison for two years, hoping that maybe that he's going to bribe Felix,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.140]   but that never happens.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.760]   So two years he's doing ministry.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   And then finally, the leadership changes, and then he said, "You know what?
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.400]   Let's move on, because I don't want the responsibility over this guy anymore."
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.680]   They send him off to King Agrippa in chapter 25.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.840]   So he stands before the king, and he gets a hearing from this king.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.540]   King Agrippa was one of the kings of Israel that was stationed there by the Romans.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.600]   So they're kind of puppet figures.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.680]   But yet, nevertheless, he was the king.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.320]   He stands before the king, and as soon as he gets a chance, he begins to preach the
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.640]   gospel to the king.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.280]   He said, "This is why they hate me.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.020]   This is why these Roman guards, this is why I was in prison.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.760]   This is why I'm standing before you."
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.480]   And he begins to preach.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:59.240]   And the king of Agrippa, in chapter 26, verse 28, just, "I don't understand this guy."
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.400]   He says, "In a short time, you will persuade me to become a Christian?"
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:08.280]   And Paul said, "I would wish to God that whether in a short or long time, not only
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:13.520]   you, but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am, except for these chains."
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:20.200]   He said, "I'm not going to relent.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.520]   Whether in chains or not in chains, whether short or long time, whether before you, before
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:31.240]   the guards, whether I'm in prison or free, my life obsession is to get the gospel out."
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:37.480]   Paul was not asking for physical protection.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.040]   Paul already said he's ready to die.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:48.240]   For to him, to die is gain, because that means he gets to go to what he's been longing for
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.760]   faster, to be with Christ.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.400]   But to stay is also great, because that means more fruitful labor for me.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:03.880]   And so, how do you kill the joy of a man who rejoices if he dies and he rejoices if he
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.360]   lives?
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.120]   All because he is consumed with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.080]   This is part of our joy.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.640]   The reason why you are so frustrated, the reason why you feel like you lack purpose
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   and direction is because you have created your own will.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:32.600]   And you're begging God to get him to bend towards you, and he won't bend, and you're
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.280]   frustrated.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:43.440]   But here's this man who's chained, at times even beaten and stoned.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.900]   He was consumed.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.040]   As a result of that, Agrippa says, "You know what?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.200]   I can't deal with this guy."
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.000]   And Paul says, "I appealed to Caesar because he's a Roman citizen."
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.040]   He said, "Well, I could have possibly let you go, but since you're appealing to Caesar,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.320]   I have to send you off."
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:10.920]   So he sends him on a boat in chapter 27, and he begins his journey to Rome.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:16.560]   But even this journey to Rome isn't wasted, because he's going as a prisoner.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.800]   And there are over 200 guards on that ship, and then this huge storm comes in, and it
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.280]   looks like they're going to drown.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.160]   And so the guards don't want to lose the prisoners, so they're thinking, "You know, we should
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.920]   throw all these guys off and then drown them to save ourselves."
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:37.040]   But, because Paul made such an impression upon the leadership and upon the people on
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   the boat, he said, "You know what?
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.040]   We're going to be determined.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.520]   We're going to somehow get him on this boat, and we're going to get him there."
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.560]   Eventually, God prophesies that no one's going to die, and he answers the prayer, and all
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.800]   of them are saved, and they get shipwrecked on an island.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.960]   And on this island, he gets bitten by a viper.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:02.800]   And the people on the island are thinking, "Well, surely this must be a sinner, because
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.080]   even after all of that, he's going to die.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.960]   So the gods must be angry with him."
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.600]   So initially they say, "You know, this guy, he probably deserved it, whatever it was he
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   did."
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   When they see him, they don't die.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   They say, "He got bitten by a viper?
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   He doesn't die?
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.880]   There's something supernatural going on.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.760]   Maybe he's a god."
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:28.920]   So they turn from calling him a sinner to a god, and then while he is on that island,
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:35.680]   a prominent man's father, he gets sick, and then Paul goes and he heals him, and then
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.360]   it begins to stir.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   And so during that trip from Jerusalem to Rome, all these things happen, so that by
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:50.800]   the time he gets to Rome, Paul's no ordinary prisoner.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.440]   He's kind of won over those people.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.560]   They're waiting for him to come.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.720]   He gets to Rome in chapter 28, verse 15, "And the brethren, when they heard about us, came
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.280]   from there as far as the market of Appius, and three inns to meet us.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.640]   And when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage."
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.520]   He gets a free ride, right?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.640]   That boat ride was free.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.320]   And meanwhile, he was able to witness to all these people, so he was praying for fruitfulness,
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.480]   and all that was happening all along the way.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:25.440]   And finally, he comes to Rome, and all the leaders of Rome come to him, asking him, and
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.800]   he's able to spend time with them, but that's not where it ends.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.840]   He said, "All the Jews," in verse 17, "hear about him.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.360]   After three days, Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.120]   when they came together, he began saying to them, 'Brethren,'" and begins to preach
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.600]   the gospel to them.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:48.480]   "In the comfort of his inn, with the protection of the Roman guards."
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.320]   You can't ... I'm pretty sure when Paul was praying for this prayer, for protection, for
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.900]   fruitfulness to get to them, he wasn't imagining the Roman guards.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.680]   He wasn't imagining the free boat ride that took him there.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.720]   He wasn't imagining in the comfort of his inn, and people coming to him and asking him,
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:13.640]   "What are you about?" and then preaching the gospel in Rome, almost ... I mean, even though
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:18.880]   he's a prisoner, he's being treated like a royalty, and he's preaching the gospel to
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   them.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.400]   Verse 21, "We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any other
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   brethren come here, reported, and spoken anything about you, but we desire to hear from you
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.400]   what your views are for concerning this sect.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.320]   It is known to us that it is spoken against in everywhere."
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   Verse 23, "When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.560]   and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God, and testing
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.720]   to persuade them concerning Jesus from both the law of Moses and from the prophets from
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.160]   morning until night."
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:55.800]   He had a captivated audience that was coming to him at his own inn, protected by the Romans.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.980]   It was better than a movie.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.000]   If you didn't see the connection between the prayers in Romans and what was happening here,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.040]   you may not have never seen it.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.280]   I mean, this is exciting.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.600]   Part of the reason why our Christian life is so exciting is because we are walking with
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:25.560]   Christ, and God answers our prayers in the context of following where he goes.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.040]   And why so many Christians are frustrated with their life is because they are outside,
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.040]   living outside of the will of God, and they are wondering where this life is.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.160]   I thought if I went to church, if I went to Bible study, if I chose the right group and
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.920]   had the right friends and were disciplined the right way, that this life would be abundant.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:50.000]   And then when they don't experience that, they think there is something wrong with Christianity.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.640]   But we are not going where Christ is going.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.240]   We are not doing what Christ is doing.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.860]   We are not saying what Christ is saying.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:02.480]   And that is maybe the reason why we are not experiencing the life that Christ is giving.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   Even in the context of people wanting to kill him, he saw God being faithful to him.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:18.440]   In verse 30, "And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters, and was welcoming
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.160]   all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.440]   Christ with all openness, unhindered."
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.840]   Unhindered.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.920]   And people are vowing to kill him.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.560]   Everywhere he went, they picked up rocks to stone him.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.800]   God sends the Roman guards, hundreds of them, to protect him.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.040]   God orchestrates these things so that he can show up to Rome, and it almost kind of gives
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   him a platform.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.760]   "Paul, preach now."
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:56.160]   That's what makes Christian life exciting.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:01.840]   You will never have the kind of assurance of your prayers when you pray than when you
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.920]   have committed yourself to preaching of the gospel.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:15.060]   You will never experience the intimacy of God's heart until you understand God's brokenness
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.300]   for the lost.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:26.880]   You will never know the urgency of this spiritual battle until you have been on your knees,
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.380]   crying out for those who do not yet know Christ.
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:41.000]   You will never understand what propelled Christ to hang on that cross and then called his
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.840]   church to do the same.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.360]   "Go preach the gospel, make disciples of all the nations."
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:53.460]   You will never understand the heart of Christ until you understand the brokenness, the compassion
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:52:00.060]   of our Christ for you, for me, and for the world.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   The Bible doesn't explain to us what happens after chapter 8.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:08.100]   According to church tradition, Paul is released after two years.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:13.300]   He ends up getting the support that he needs and then he actually goes out to Spain.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:19.680]   Eventually, when his work is done, he is recaptured and he's beheaded.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.420]   And as he prayed in Philippines, he went to the Lord in glory.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:30.640]   And that's where he is.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.860]   I pray for my own life.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.540]   I pray for your life.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.260]   I pray for our church.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.340]   I pray for our generation.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.300]   That we would not be whitewashed tombs.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:50.260]   That we would live consistent with the gospel that we love, that saved us, that we sing,
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:59.420]   that we proclaim and be on our knees, get on our feet to spread this gospel.
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.280]   Because then and only then will prayer make any sense.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.460]   Then and only then will worship be vibrant.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:11.860]   Then and only then our fellowship is more than just gathering of Christians.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:16.820]   Then and only then will you really understand what it means to have life and to really have
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.800]   this life abundantly.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:24.060]   When you are no longer grasping onto the life here and eager to go to the life that he has
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:28.140]   prepared for us, he who finds his life shall lose it.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:31.100]   He who loses his life for my sake shall find it.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:32.100]   Let's pray.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:46.260]   [ Silence ]
