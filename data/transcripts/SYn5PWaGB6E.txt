[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I've been on His precious path,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   a plain banishment from God.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Jesus, thanks be to You.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Jesus,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   all my trust is in Your blood.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Jesus,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   rescue us through Your great love.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Sweet the sounds of saving grace,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Christ died for me.

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   we can put on Sweet the Sounds of Saving Grace, right?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   In there, yeah?

[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I was in darkness all of my life
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I lived a victim of the night
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Spiritual may I be saved
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I swore I knew the way of my own
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The rocks are hot, made of stone

[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   On my tongue the power of Christ is strong
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'm into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Heaven and Satan by grace, grace alone
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So I'll stand, so I'll stand

[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   Well, good morning again.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   At this time, I'd like to give just one announcement
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   and have the privilege of introducing to you our speaker.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   We are so thankful to have Dr. John Street
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.900]   and his wife, Janie Street, with us for this weekend.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.900]   It's gonna be a great weekend for us to fellowship
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.900]   in the word and thoughts of this topic
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.900]   of biblical reconciliation.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   Now, what I'd like to highlight real briefly
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.900]   is that we have these books,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   and I wanna just briefly mention them to you.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   The first book, it's called
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.900]   The Biblical Counseling Guide for Women,
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   and Dr. Street and Mrs. Street have put this together.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.900]   This is a great book as a resource in your library
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.900]   as it goes over the most common issues and struggles
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.900]   that people experience with their mental, spiritual,
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.900]   or even physical issues.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.900]   And so it covers different topics,
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.900]   as anxiety, depressions, thoughts, and so forth.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.900]   It's a great book to have that they've written.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.900]   Also, similarly structured is this book
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.900]   called Men Counseling Men,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.900]   and this book also covers various topics
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   that you'll run into in the experience
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   of trying to help care for souls of men,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   various struggles that we have on a common basis.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   Also, most recently, Dr. Street has put together this book,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.900]   Passions of the Heart.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.900]   Although this book specifically deals with
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   perhaps a stubborn and, again, pervasive sin
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   of sexual immorality or lust,
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.900]   if you wanna go deep into the question of why
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   sometimes we struggle so deeply,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.900]   this book goes deep, asking the questions
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.900]   of what are the motivations, what are the idols,
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.900]   and unearthing those things.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   And so this is a very, very valuable book to have.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.900]   Thankfully, we have these books provided
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.900]   so that we can give them away to you.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.900]   And the way that we're going to do this is, as you know,
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.900]   later this afternoon at 3.30, we're gonna be doing a Q&A.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.900]   And the way that we're going to be receiving your questions
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.900]   and how you can submit those is by texting in a number
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.900]   that's going to be posted on our Community Retreat
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   Facebook group.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   That number will be posted, and so don't worry about it now.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   Once the session is done,
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.900]   whoever texts me first with a question,
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.900]   the First Lady will give this copy,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   and for the First Man, we'll give this copy.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.900]   I'm gonna save the third copy for our next session.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.900]   So after the session's done,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   when you hear certain things that you're curious about
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.900]   and wanna ask a follow-up question from the sessions,
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   or you just have questions related to just a broader topic
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.900]   of biblical reconciliation and counseling,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.900]   make sure to submit your questions,
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.900]   and again, the first persons who submit that
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.900]   will get a free copy, okay?
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.900]   All right.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.900]   And then at this time, I'd like to just highlight
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.900]   several things about Dr. Street, our speaker.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.900]   In your programs, there are more information
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.900]   about both, you know, his past education
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   and his ministry experience,
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.900]   but I'd like to highlight that he is currently
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.900]   a teaching professor and the chair of the Master of Arts
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.900]   in Biblical Counseling at the Masters University and Seminary,
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   and he also teaches, flies out to Kentucky,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.900]   to teach at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.900]   At the Masters Seminary is where I first met Dr. Street.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.900]   This was back in 2007 when I was young
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.900]   and not knowing what I was doing,
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.900]   and the class was so difficult,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.900]   a lot of the students huddled together to complain,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   "Dr. Street, it's so hard."
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.900]   And then, first of all, I started to think,
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.900]   "Well, you know what? I'm getting my money's worth."
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.900]   But Dr. Street really enforced on us,
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.900]   "When it comes to soul care and counseling,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.900]   you're going to need this for ministry."
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   And lo and behold, that's absolutely true.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.900]   But what's more, at that time, I was in my--
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.900]   just getting ready for marriage.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.900]   I got married in 2008, and I said,
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.900]   "Forget ministry. I need this now for marriage,"
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.900]   because it was absolutely vital for my own soul.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.900]   What's more, I want to also highlight
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   that Dr. Street is the president of the Board of Trustees
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   for the Association of Biblical Counselors.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.900]   And as you guys know, a good number of our members
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.900]   go to the weekend of training.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.900]   A good number of you are signing up
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.900]   and interested in being trained through that way.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.900]   Our hope and desire is that at our church,
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.900]   we continue to train people and disciple people
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   essentially how to take care of other people,
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.900]   not according to the wisdom of the world,
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.900]   but according to the power of the Scriptures. Amen?
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   And so we really want to continue working with the ministry
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.900]   and making sure that people are trained
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   and so on that end, Dr. Street has had over 40 years
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.900]   of ministry experience involved with training men
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.900]   for the ministry according to the high, high, powerful Word of God.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.900]   And we are so grateful that he is here with us this weekend.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.900]   Let's give a warm, warm welcome to Dr. Street.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.900]   [applause]
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.900]   Thanks, Mark.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   [applause]
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.900]   Wow, thank you very much, Pastor Mark.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   I really appreciate it.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   It's good to see you again, and you did survive the class,
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.900]   which is really good.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   And so it's a pleasure.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.900]   I've already met some of you.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.900]   Hopefully, you get to meet several more
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.900]   before this particular retreat is over with.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.900]   So good morning.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.900]   Good morning.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   Thank you, both of you.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.900]   Good morning.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   Good morning.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.900]   That's better.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   I wanted to see if you were just awake.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.900]   All right, we need to deal with a really critical issue
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   that affects the Church of Jesus Christ
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.900]   almost anywhere you go in the world today,
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.900]   and that has to do with relationships among believers.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   What we're going to talk about this weekend
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.900]   is going to, in a sense, lay the foundational bedrock
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.900]   for every kind of relationship,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.900]   especially when it gets into trouble,
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.900]   and what the Bible says about bringing about genuine reconciliation.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.900]   This is really critical.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.900]   Now, before we do, let's go to the Lord in prayer,
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.900]   and then we're going to go right into Scripture if we can.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.900]   Gracious Lord, we're grateful for the opportunity of a retreat like this
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   to spend some time focusing upon critical elements of the Word of God
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.900]   that deal with our interpersonal relationships with one another.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.900]   And so I pray, Father, that you will use the Word of God, as only you can,
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.900]   through the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   to bring about the necessary changes in our thinking and in our hearts
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.900]   in order to help us be more unified within the body of Christ.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.900]   With an increasingly hostile world,
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.900]   the unity of the body of Christ is critical.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.900]   So we pray that you'll use this as only you can.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.900]   This we pray in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   Now, if you take a look at the sheet that you probably have in front of you,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.900]   we talk about in this first session,
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.900]   we want to talk about getting to the heart of conflict.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:41.900]   Primarily, we want to start there because when you read a lot of books,
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   whether they're secular or Christian, whatever the case may be,
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   in the area of conflict resolution,
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.900]   very little is talked about in regards to this issue.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   And in fact, it's almost not mentioned, even among the Christian books,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:03.900]   which is a very sad thing because this is where everything is going to start
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   and it's where everything is going to end
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.900]   if there's going to be real, true unity within the body of Christ.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.900]   This is going to affect a husband and wife relationship.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.900]   It's going to affect a parent-child relationship.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.900]   It's going to affect your relationship with your closest friends.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.900]   It's going to affect the way in which you interact with people on the job.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.900]   Everything that we talk about this weekend will affect
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   every interpersonal relationship that you have.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.900]   So, we make the little comment in the paper there in front of you
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.900]   that every conflict within the church presents the pastor with a great teaching opportunity
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   because every conflict within the church is a reminder of how much Christ is needed.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.900]   The source of all conflict begins in the heart.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.900]   James 4, verses 1 through 3.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.900]   We're going to come back to that in a little bit.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:00.900]   With its cravings and dominant desires which fuel anger, slander, violent reaction,
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.900]   it denies the truth and the grace of the gospel in the Christian life
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.900]   because it positions itself in pride.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.900]   It positions itself in pride.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.900]   Now, I want you to grab your Bible just for a moment
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.900]   and by way of beginning, let's go over to Matthew 5, the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   where Jesus talks about this.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.900]   We're talking about biblical reconciliation.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.900]   By the way, this is the way to think about it.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.900]   The world talks about it in terms of conflict resolution,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.900]   but that is a very short-sighted and truncated view
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.900]   on how to deal with interpersonal relationships.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   Our goal as Christians is not to resolve conflicts.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   That's not our goal.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.900]   Our goal--in fact, some conflicts are not resolvable.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.900]   Paul even talks about that in Romans 12.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.900]   If possible--sometimes it's not--as far as it depends upon you,
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.900]   sometimes it doesn't depend upon you, live at peace with all men.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   All right?
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.900]   So it's not possible to bring about reconciliation or--what can I say?
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:14.900]   It's not possible to bring about some kind of conflict resolution in every situation.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:15.900]   That's not possible.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.900]   But that's not our goal anyhow.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.900]   And in fact, Jesus talks about the fact in verse 9 of Matthew 5,
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.900]   "Blessed are the peacemakers."
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.900]   And you hear a lot about this.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   You hear Christians talk about, "I need to be a peacemaker," and that's okay.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   That's infinitely better than being a peacekeeper.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.900]   God has not called us to be peacekeepers.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.900]   God has called us to be peacemakers, so that's really true.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.900]   But that is only one step in the broader reconciliation process.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.900]   He starts there by peacemaking, but peacemaking is not the end.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.900]   It's just one step in the process.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.900]   What is the broader process?
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:02.900]   Well, if you take a look a little bit later on there in chapter 5,
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   he talks about this.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   And in fact, he talks about the fact that in verse 23,
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:22.900]   "If there you are presenting your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.900]   leave your offering there before the altar, go and first not seek peace at this particular point."
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.900]   Peacemaking is only one step in the process, but the ultimate goal here,
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   "But be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering."
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:52.900]   This is why we prefer to call this conflict reconciliation, not conflict resolution.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:59.900]   Conflict reconciliation, because the goal here is to not come to an agreement
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.900]   or dismiss the hostility of the conflict.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.900]   That's not our goal.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   The goal here is to bring relationships together.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.900]   That's what reconciliation means.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.900]   That's what we must do.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   So when we're talking about this this whole weekend, we're looking at this as a broader process.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.900]   It's not going to be something that happens overnight.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   It's not going to be something that happens quickly, but it's a broader process.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:34.900]   Now, in order to help us to understand this, and especially in relationship to what's going on in the heart,
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   and by the way, real change, when there has been a disagreement between you and another brother or sister in Christ,
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   real change begins on a heart level.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.900]   Real change begins on a heart level.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.900]   Otherwise, it's superficial change.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:02.900]   The heart's got to change before there is any step towards genuine reconciliation.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:08.900]   Now, help us get started, and to fuel our thinking in this, let's go to James 4.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:17.900]   We already mentioned this, but he asks the question, James asks in verse 1,
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.900]   "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you?"
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.900]   That's a great question, isn't it?
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you?
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   If you listen to most Christians today, you'll probably hear something like,
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:36.900]   "Well, you know, I'm a sanguine, and I'm married to a caloric, and that's the reason why.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.900]   I'm married to somebody that has an adversarial personality.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.900]   That's the reason why we have the problems that we have.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   Well, men are from Mars, and women are from--oh, you know that, don't you?
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   Men are from Mars, and women are from--that's the reason why there's so much conflict in this world today.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.900]   No, that's not the reason that there is conflict in the world.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.900]   There is no such thing in the Bible as adversarial personalities.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.900]   That doesn't exist.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.900]   That's not the problem.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:12.900]   And in fact, that whole personality theory stuff that's a part of contemporary psychology today
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.900]   goes back to ancient Greek philosophy.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   Hippocrates was key.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   Hippocratic Oath, medical doctors take the Hippocratic Oath.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   Hippocrates believed that your personality was a result of one of four bodily humors,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   that if you had an overabundance of one of four bodily humors,
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:38.900]   then all of a sudden that was the personality that you possessed throughout your life.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   One is blood.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   If you had an overabundance of blood, then you had one personality.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.900]   If you had an overabundance of phlegm, that was another personality.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.900]   If you had an overabundance of yellow bile, it was another personality.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.900]   If you had an overabundance of black bile, that was another personality.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:02.900]   And the Latinized terms for them--of course, blood was sanguine, phlegm was phlegmatic,
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:08.900]   yellow bile is caloric, black bile is melancholia.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.900]   And Hippocrates says, "I can prove this to you.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:24.900]   Take somebody who is outgoing, energetic, life of the party, drain his blood."
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   Total personality change.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:40.900]   Let's say if you have a person that's moody, sad, kind of irritable most of the time,
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:51.900]   too much black bile, so he would give people really strong herbal laxatives.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.900]   After you've been sitting on the john for several days, everything looks up.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.900]   Your whole personality changes.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.900]   Everything's different.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.900]   Proof positive.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.900]   Personality's related to your bodily humors.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:14.900]   Now, we would never say that today, but it's amazing how many psychological tests are based upon that today.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.900]   The Taylor-Johnson temperament analysis test, the Minnesota moldophasic personality inventories,
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   all those tests are based upon that same kind of a theory that we have fixed personalities.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.900]   Nowhere in Scripture does that ever say, "If that's the key to our well-being,
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:36.900]   then God has left out a significant part of our well-being in Scripture."
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:47.900]   If that's the key to our well-being, it's not because, well, the Bible has a word for that, baloney.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.900]   All right?
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.900]   Just baloney.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:52.900]   That's not true.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   In fact, if you take a look at what the Bible really says about personality,
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.900]   personality is fluid, it's not fixed.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.900]   It changes as years go by.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   I'm not the same personality that I was when I graduated from high school,
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.900]   and I tell my students, "You ought to be happy about that."
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.900]   I'm not the same personality.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.900]   I'm a different person.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.900]   This is what is referred to in Scripture as progressive sanctification.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.900]   It changes us fundamentally,
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.900]   even on a nature level.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.900]   Talk about more of that later.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.900]   It changes us on a nature level.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.900]   So, personality is not fixed.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.900]   It's fluid.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:45.900]   It changes as time goes by at best.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   So, notice what he says here.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.900]   He says, he answers his own question here in verse 1,
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.900]   "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you?
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   It is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members."
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.900]   Now, by making that statement, he's basically saying,
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.900]   "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts?
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:14.900]   It has to do with what you think is going to bring you happiness.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   It's what you think is going to bring you happiness."
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.900]   And he says in verse 2, "You lust."
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.900]   That's a deep internal craving.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.900]   This is not talking about sexual lust here.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.900]   It's talking about deep passions inside.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.900]   You want something really, really bad,
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.900]   and you don't have it, so you commit murder.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.900]   Now, I don't think the Christians were going around
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   murdering each other here in the Jerusalem church.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.900]   Why does he say commit murder?
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.900]   He's using murder in the same sense that Jesus, his half-brother,
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.900]   is using it in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   What is that?
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:48:00.900]   Well, if you hate in your heart, you're as good as a murderer, right?
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:05.900]   If you hate in your heart, you're as good as a murderer.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:10.900]   The heart of a murderer and the heart of a hater is the same heart.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.900]   No difference between the two.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:15.900]   It's just one has acted it out and the other one hasn't.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.900]   But the heart level is the same thing.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:24.900]   Just like the heart of an adulterer and the heart of a luster is the same heart,
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.900]   it's just one has acted it out and the other one hasn't.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.900]   It's the same thing.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.900]   On a heart level, it's the same thing.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:38.900]   What God sees in us, it's the same thing.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.900]   Don't you love L.A. traffic?
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   Isn't it wonderful?
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.900]   We came here yesterday.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:51.900]   What was supposed to be a three-hour trip turned into six hours
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.900]   because of the traffic in L.A.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.900]   We're just crawling down the freeway bumper to bumper.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.900]   You go to some auto parts store here in the area,
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   and you'll find you can buy these little things you can mount on the dashboard of your car,
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   in order to help you in really heavy traffic.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.900]   It's a little thing that has buttons on it,
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.900]   and one button is labeled "missile,"
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.900]   the other one is "machine gun,"
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.900]   the other one is a "grenade,"
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:29.900]   and you can blow up the cars in front of you figuratively.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:34.900]   Why? Because those people are in your way.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.900]   They're in your way.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.900]   That's why you're doing that.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   The heart of a hater and the heart of a murderer is the same heart.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.900]   No difference between the two.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:58.900]   Just the same heart at God's level, from God's perspective.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.900]   So he says, "You are envious," verse 2 says,
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   "and you cannot obtain, so you fight and you quarrel.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.900]   You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.900]   The idea here is without proper motives.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   In fact, he says in verse 3,
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.900]   "You ask and you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.900]   so that you may spend it on your pleasures,
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:26.900]   on what you believe is going to bring you happiness."
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:32.900]   Now, in order to understand this, we've got to understand the human heart.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.900]   And we have a major problem,
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.900]   because what we do when we read our Bibles
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.900]   is when we come to the word "heart," we commit a semantic anachronism.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   That is, we import into the word "heart" a contemporary idea
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.900]   of what we believe the heart is,
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:00.900]   rather than allowing the Bible to define what the heart is.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.900]   And so we miss what the Bible's saying.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.900]   That's a semantic anachronism.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:10.900]   It's very easy to do, to take a late idea of a word
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:17.900]   and pour it into an ancient word, an old word.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.900]   Old Testament term "lave," New Testament term, Greek term "cardia."
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.900]   What does it mean? How is it used?
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   And by the way, it's used uniformly from the Old Testament into the New Testament.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.900]   The same concept in terms of the heart is there.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:37.900]   It's just that we look at the heart differently.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.900]   And so we miss it.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.900]   What's going on with the heart?
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.900]   What's really happening?
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.900]   So we want to take a look at the problem of sin
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.900]   as it affects the worship of the heart, especially in conflict.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:55.900]   And Scripture says the source of this comes from those pleasures
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   that come out, actually, of your heart.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.900]   What does that mean?
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.900]   These pleasures that come out of your heart?
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:08.900]   Well, there's so many passages that we could take a look at here,
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.900]   but let's just take a look at a couple of them.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.900]   Let's go back to Genesis 6 and verse 5.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   Genesis 6 and verse 5.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   Here we're interested in what the Lord says about man before he sends the flood.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:34.900]   And he says in verse 5, "The Lord saw," and by the way, in the Hebrew language,
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.900]   that word "saw" is in the continuous sense.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:46.900]   "The Lord continually saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth."
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.900]   And notice this now. Look at this.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   "And every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:58.900]   Now notice the way the heart is described there.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.900]   It's described as "intending."
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:06.900]   It's described as "thinking."
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:13.900]   And it was only evil continually.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.900]   Kind of the American, European view of the heart is to pour romance into it, right?
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.900]   Feelings.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.900]   When we talk about the heart, that's what we read into what the Bible says.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   We read "romance," we read "intense feelings," we read "intense emotions"
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.900]   into the biblical term of the heart,
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:39.900]   and yet that's not the biblical view of the heart at all.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.900]   The heart has very little to do with our feelings.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:47.900]   It does affect our feelings, but the heart has very little to do with our feelings.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.900]   It has very little to do with our emotions.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:58.900]   It has everything to do with what we intend and what we think.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.900]   We think with our heart.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.900]   We intend with our heart.
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.900]   We purpose with our heart.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.900]   That's what we do.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.900]   I know it's not on your list there, but let's go over to Proverbs 20.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.900]   Proverbs 20, and we're interested in verse 5.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:26.900]   Think of this carefully, Proverbs 20, verse 5, where it says, "A plan in the heart of a man is like deep water,
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.900]   but a man of understanding draws it out."
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:37.900]   So now, here, Solomon is saying that the heart plans, or we could translate this,
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.900]   "The purposes of a man's heart is like deep water."
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:51.900]   And, in fact, back in chapter 19, verse 21, it says, "Many plans are in a man's heart."
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   Many plans.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:00.900]   Lots of planning, lots of purposing, lots of intending, lots of thinking.
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.900]   That's a whole different view.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:10.900]   That's not a romantic view of the heart, not an emotional view of the heart at all.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.900]   We know that because around Valentine's Day, what do you see?
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.900]   Lots of hearts, right?
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.900]   Big red hearts.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:28.900]   You know, ladies, if your husband says, "I love you with all my heart," you ought to slap him really good.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.900]   It's not biblical at all.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.900]   All right?
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.900]   Because all he's saying to you is, "I have lots of good intentions for you."
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.900]   All right?
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.900]   If he really wants to be romantic and he's going to be biblical,
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.900]   then he's going to use a different organ of the body, not the heart.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.900]   He's going to use the bowels.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.900]   All right?
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.900]   Ephesians 4:32 talks about being tender-bowled, that deals with emotions.
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.900]   So he should be saying to you, "I love you with all my bowels."
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.900]   All right?
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.900]   Now that is true emotions.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.900]   That's true romance.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.900]   I told my wife--she's sitting right here.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.900]   She's my girlfriend too.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.900]   I told her I want to create a Christian greeting card company with bowels on the front
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.900]   and Cupid shooting arrows through bowels.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:29.900]   She doesn't think it will go anywhere, but at least it will be biblical.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:30.900]   All right?
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.900]   "I love you with all my--"
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.900]   But now you're talking about anybody that's had constipation know how emotional that is.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:40.900]   The Bible's very realistic.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.900]   "I love you with all my bowels.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.900]   I love you with all my emotions."
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.900]   Now we're talking about emotions.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.900]   But when we're talking about the heart, we're talking about planning,
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.900]   purposing, thinking.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.900]   That's what we're doing, intending.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:04.900]   "I plan, I purpose, I intend, I think with my heart."
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.900]   That's different.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.900]   And by the way, you can see this.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.900]   Let's go over to Mark chapter 7.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:17.900]   Even in the New Testament, this is the way that Jesus uses the heart.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.900]   Mark chapter 7.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:26.900]   Notice how what Jesus says, he says in verse 15,
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:31.900]   "There's nothing outside of a man which can defile him if it goes into him,
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.900]   but the things which proceed out of man are what defile a man.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.900]   If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.900]   And then in verse 18 he says, and he said to them,
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.900]   "Are you so lacking in understanding also?
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:51.900]   Do you not understand that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:59.900]   because it does not go into his heart but into his stomach and then is eliminated?
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.900]   Thus he declared all foods clean," it says there.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:08.900]   And he was saying, "That which proceeds out of the man, that's what defiles the man,
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:12.900]   for from within, out of the heart of man, proceed," notice this,
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.900]   "evil thoughts."
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.900]   There you go, right at the top of that list.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.900]   Evil thoughts.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:28.900]   Fornications, thefts, murders, adultery, deeds of covening, wickedness,
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.900]   Now, the first six are all plural because they have to do with actions.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:45.900]   The second six of these that are listed here are singular because they have to do with attitudes.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.900]   First part has to do with actions, second part has to do with attitudes,
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.900]   but all of this proceeds out of the heart.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:59:01.900]   What a man thinks, what he purposes, what he intends.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:10.900]   In verse 23, it says, "All these evil things proceed from within, and they defile the man."
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.900]   They defile the man.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.900]   So, we have a problem.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.900]   It is a major problem.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.900]   The problem is our heart.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:25.900]   It's what proceeds out of the heart, what proceeds from within that causes these quarrels,
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:36.900]   these difficulties, these conflicts, the difficulties and hardships that come in interpersonal relationships.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:44.900]   In order to kind of picture this, the Bible then would view the heart as essentially the control center of life.
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:48.900]   It is the control center of life.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.900]   It controls everything in your life.
[00:59:52.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   And from this, it is your thoughts, it infects your will, your conscience, your motives, your desires,
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:07.900]   and all these things proceed from within.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:14.900]   That's very difficult to see this, but there's a dotted line just below that word "behavior."
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.900]   The heart is that which only God sees.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.900]   The behavior is what other people see.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:34.900]   And when your heart is focused upon self and what self wants in terms of what you believe is going to bring you happiness,
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:45.900]   what you believe is going to bring you joy, then it's always and universally going to produce bad fruit.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   It's going to produce bad fruit in terms of attitudes and behaviors and words.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:04.900]   They're going to cause all kinds of conflicts, all kinds of heartaches.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:12.900]   However, when your heart is really focused on Christ, then it's going to produce good fruit.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:21.900]   It's going to produce good fruit, things that actually are beneficial to others.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:32.900]   So, the location of real conflict starts inside, not out here.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:38.900]   Real conflict occurs in us, not out here.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.900]   I don't care how disagreeable that other person is.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:48.900]   I don't care how angry that other person is, how hateful they are towards you, that other person is.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:55.900]   The conflict begins in you, inside.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   Because it's how you interpret that situation, how you interpret that particular person,
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   how you view them as being an obstacle to what you believe is going to bring you happiness.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:23.900]   Now, Scripture makes it very clear that the occupation of the heart is to worship.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:29.900]   Every person on the planet has a worshiping heart.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:35.900]   The most avowed atheist has a worshiping heart.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.900]   That's the way that God created his or her heart.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.900]   It worships something.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   It can worship people or things.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.900]   It can worship prestige or power.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.900]   It can worship control.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.900]   It can worship pleasure.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.900]   There's lots of things that it can worship.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.900]   I'll give you an illustration of that in a moment.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.900]   And the Bible talks about this in numerous places.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   We could literally spend the rest of our time just taking a look at all these different places.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:20.900]   So the heart can worship peace and possessions and popularity and prestige and play and power and pleasure and people and protection and physical health.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:29.900]   All right, I'm really a preacher trapped in a counselor's body, but everything has to be alliterated if you're a preacher.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.900]   You know, it's just part of the rules.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:38.900]   Now, that's not an exhaustive list, but the heart can worship those things.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:47.900]   These are things that we see in this world that we think are going to bring us happiness,
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:54.900]   and we believe that that's going to make our life complete.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   It's going to bring me joy.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.900]   God created every heart to worship.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:18.900]   This speaks of what that person most highly values and what they really esteem and appreciate in their heart.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:23.900]   So the location is the heart.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.900]   The occupation is that of worship.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.900]   That's the occupation of the heart.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.900]   But that brings us to another thing.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:43.900]   The Bible also tells us that one of the big issues is that the heart lusts.
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.900]   And this is where idolatry takes over.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.900]   Heart idolatry.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:58.900]   This is where we elevate things to God-like level in our hearts.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   And we begin to look at those things as the most important things.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.200]   And I get up in the morning because I'm trying to serve whatever I consider to be important
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   in that day.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.500]   And I think about it and work on it all day long.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.540]   And before I go to bed at night, that's the last thing I think about.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:21.500]   Before I go to bed, how can I service that value, that esteemed, dominant value in my
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   life?
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.580]   How can I do that?
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.600]   The heart worships.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.300]   And heart idolatry is a very serious issue.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.460]   Let me illustrate this for you just for a moment.
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.620]   Take one of those passages.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:41.420]   Let's go back to the Ezekiel passage just by way of example.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:06:02.280]   Ezekiel chapter 14, you can see this in Ezekiel 14 where God speaks to the people of Israel
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.120]   because of their idolatrous ways.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:09.840]   And in verse 1 it says, "Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down before
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.760]   me and the word of the Lord came to me saying, 'Son of man, these men have set up idols in
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:21.620]   their hearts and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of their iniquity.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.200]   Should I be consulted by them at all?
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.120]   Therefore speak to them and tell them, 'Thus saith the Lord God, any man of the house of
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.720]   Israel who sets up idols in his hearts puts right before his face the stumbling block
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.960]   of his iniquity and then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will be brought to give him an
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:51.440]   answer in the manner of in view of the multitude of his idol in order to lay a hold of the
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.920]   hearts of the house of Israel who are estranged from me through all their idols.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.400]   Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus saith the Lord God, repent and turn away from
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:07.000]   your idols and turn your faces away from all of your abominations.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.600]   For anyone of the house of Israel or of the immigrants who stay in Israel who separates
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:17.480]   himself from me and sets up idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:25.640]   of his iniquity and then comes to the prophet to inquire of me for himself, I the Lord will
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.040]   be brought to answer him in my own person.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:34.720]   I will set my face against that man and I will make him a sign and a proverb and I will
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:40.240]   cut him off from among the people so that you will know that I am the Lord.'"
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:49.720]   Now let me share with you the fact that Jesus, well in this case the Lord, the pre-incarnate
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:55.880]   Lord in this particular case is talking to Ezekiel and basically telling the leadership
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:03.160]   and the elders of Israel of how angered he is over the fact that they have set up idols
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.840]   in their hearts.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:12.320]   And he says, "When they come to inquire of me, I myself," the Lord says, "will speak
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   to him."
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:20.720]   Now in the Old Testament that was a fearful thing because there was always an intermediary
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.360]   between the Old Testament saint and God.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.720]   When the saint wanted to go to God, they went through the priest.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.200]   When the saint wanted to hear from God, it was always through the prophet.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.480]   There was always an intermediary between them and someone else.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.320]   But God keeps saying here, "These people who have set up idols in their heart, I'm going
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.240]   to deal with them personally.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.560]   I'm going to deal with them personally.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.960]   I'm going to come to them."
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.200]   And then he says in verse 8, when he says, "I will set up my face against that man and
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.600]   make him a sign and a proverb and I will cut him off from among my people so that you will
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.920]   know that I am the Lord."
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.800]   There's only one other time that God says that in the entire Old Testament, and that's
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.960]   back in the book of Leviticus where God is dealing with the people of Israel who are
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:20.720]   offering their children as human sacrifices to the false Canaanite gods of Baal and Ashtoreth.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:29.280]   In other words, having an idol in your heart is on the same level as sacrificing children.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   It's the same level.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:40.440]   To show you exactly how serious God takes the issues of having idols in the heart, something
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:48.580]   that you want so badly that you're willing to sin in order to get it.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:55.160]   Something you want so badly that you're willing to say hateful, mean things to people who
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:02.260]   you consider to be obstacles in your way.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.100]   God says, "You have an idol in your heart.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.000]   You're bowing down to that idol."
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.720]   That's not just true in the Old Testament.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]   Same thing's true in the New Testament.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.320]   Let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.160]   Look at 1 Corinthians chapter 10.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:26.640]   Paul addresses the Christians at Corinth, and he talks about Old Testament Israels wandering
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.560]   in the wilderness as an illustration.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:37.240]   And he says in verse 6, 1 Corinthians 10.6, now look at this, zero in on this.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:45.040]   He says, "Now these things happened as examples for us so that we would not crave evil things
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.920]   as they also crave."
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   Do you see that?
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:53.880]   You ought to underline those words "crave," that we not crave the evil things that they
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.480]   also crave.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:03.120]   And as soon as he says that, then he says in verse 7, "Do not be idolaters as some of
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.120]   them were.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:10.760]   As it is written, 'The people sat down to eat and to drink and stood up to play, nor
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.340]   let us act immorally as some of them did.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:20.960]   And 23,000 fell in one day, nor let us try the Lord as some of them did and were destroyed
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:29.680]   by the serpents, nor grumble as some of them did, and they were destroyed by the destroyer.'
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.620]   Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.720]   upon whom the ends of the ages have come."
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720]   Wow.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.400]   Now, what is he talking about?
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:47.560]   He's not talking about just merely the idols of stone and wood and the idol of the golden
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.440]   calf.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:58.400]   He's not just talking about, he's talking about the fact that they craved eating, drinking,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.440]   playing, sexual immorality.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.760]   They craved that in their heart.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.720]   That's what they wanted.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.720]   That's what they wanted.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.720]   Wow.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:17.120]   It sounds like that's describing the 21st century contemporary American today, doesn't
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120]   it?
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:25.000]   Eating, drinking, entertainment, immorality.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.080]   Those are the things that they were craving in their heart.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.000]   These were the idols that they were setting up in their heart.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.600]   Verse 14 says, 'Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.840]   Flee from it.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.840]   Run from it at all cost.'
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:52.720]   This is really key because if this is the issue, if this is the problem, then what is
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:13:03.360]   it that's going on in my heart that's causing so many interpersonal clashes and difficulties?
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.400]   Why is it that I have a hard time getting along with other people?
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.720]   I don't want you to think about the person sitting next to you.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.880]   I want you to think about you.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.680]   Why do I have a hard time getting along with people?
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.360]   What's really going on here?
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.680]   The Bible says there's something going on.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.240]   It's going on in your heart.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.080]   It has to do with your heart's worship.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.880]   It has to do with what you crave more than anything else.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:43.280]   And whatever that is, that craving has reached a level that it is an idolatrous craving.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.360]   Now how can I know this?
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.840]   That's a great question, right?
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.880]   How can I know this?
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.720]   Sometimes it's hard.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.200]   The worst heart to exegete is your own heart.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:07.040]   That's the worst because one of the most disturbing things about the human heart is that it is
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.580]   so self-deceived.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.740]   That's one of the most disturbing things about the human heart.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:20.920]   It is blinded by its own self-deception.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.000]   Even Plato used to say, "The greatest deception is self-deception."
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.600]   The greatest deception is self-deception.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:34.640]   Well, the human heart is easily self-deceived.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:39.080]   It easily thinks that it's better off than what it really is.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:43.560]   So I'm not talking about you looking at the people around you.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.520]   I'm talking about you looking at you.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.680]   How do I do this?
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.860]   How do I evaluate?
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.440]   How do I understand what's going on in the human heart?
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.200]   Well sometimes you need help.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.880]   God comes along and gives you help.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.680]   You know how He helps you?
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.860]   He takes you through loss and trials, and then all of a sudden you find out what's going
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:12.860]   on in your heart.
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.120]   "Wait a minute.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.760]   I'm more than willing to look at my heart, but I don't want to have to go through loss
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:19.760]   and trials.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.400]   I don't have to do that."
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:31.320]   Well, that's nice that you say that, but if you're truly going to be sanctified, then
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.720]   you've got to be willing to go through this.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.200]   Go back to Deuteronomy chapter 8 just for a moment.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   Look at this.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.920]   Deuteronomy chapter 8.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.320]   This is just before the people of Israel enter into the Promised Land.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.800]   This is the second giving of the law, and during this particular time, God reminds them
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.220]   why He took them through 40 years of wilderness experience.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:58.080]   Why did He take them through 40 years of wilderness experience?
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.080]   Verse 2.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.760]   Deuteronomy 8 and verse 2.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.080]   "You shall remember all the way which your Lord your God has led you in the wilderness
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:12.480]   these 40 years, that He might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.560]   whether you would keep His commandments or not."
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:20.760]   Now listen, God says, "One of the main reasons I took you through this entire wilderness
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:27.080]   experience for 40 years was to test you, to know what was in your heart."
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:34.200]   Now listen, God was not, follow me here, God was not testing them so that He could know
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.320]   what was in their hearts.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320]   He's omniscient.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.920]   He already knows.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.680]   He was not testing them so that He could know what was in their hearts.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.600]   He already knew what was in their hearts.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:50.520]   He was testing them so that they would know what was in their hearts.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.640]   And it took them a 40 years examination.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:00.160]   And you think your medical doctor takes a long time.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:07.720]   This is a 40 year exam so that they could know what was in their hearts.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.600]   Sometimes I say to counselees when I'm working with them, "Listen, this is what God does.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:18.600]   He takes us through trials and difficulties to reveal certain things about our heart.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:24.480]   I hope it doesn't take 40 years for God to reveal to you what's in your heart.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.840]   I hope it doesn't take 40 years."
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.040]   Took them 40 years.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.000]   So how can we know?
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:45.920]   Well, one of the things is you have to be, listen to this, brutally honest with yourself.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:51.480]   You have to be brutally honest with yourself.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.560]   And you're going to have to ask yourself several questions.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:03.440]   This is a way to exegete your heart.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:10.480]   Let me give you six questions to ask yourself.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.160]   Well, they're not so much questions as evaluative statements.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.560]   That's what they are.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.280]   The question is, what idols are existing in my heart?
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.660]   That's the real ultimate question.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.480]   What idols are causing me to act the way that I do?
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:36.160]   What idols are determining my attitude and responses to people?
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.520]   What's really going on here?
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:48.520]   Well, one thing, pretty obvious, it's wanting something that God does not want or desire.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.680]   Wanting something that God does not want or desire.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.840]   Now that's pretty straightforward.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:04.160]   If there's something that you want that God doesn't want or desire, you want a woman who's
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:17.680]   not your wife, you want a man who's not your husband, you want children that are obedient.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.680]   God doesn't want that.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.520]   He gave you exactly the kids you need.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:30.160]   He designed them especially for you.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:37.360]   By the way, God has never made a mistake in all of eternity, and you are not His first
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.640]   mistake.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.680]   You're not His first mistake.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:58.200]   Wanting something or desiring something that God does not want or desire for you.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200]   That's pretty clear.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.760]   That's pretty straightforward.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:06.120]   Anytime we desire something that God doesn't want, and it's clear in His Word, that's an
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.920]   idol.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.560]   I'm craving that, and I think that that is going to bring me happiness.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.920]   That's what I think.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.960]   That's going to bring me joy in life.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.320]   That's what I think.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.000]   Or what about this?
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.240]   Now it's going to be a little bit more complicated.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:33.400]   It's wanting something that God wants or desires, but wanting it so bad that one becomes ungodly
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:39.440]   to get it, or ungodly if they don't.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.440]   Is that possible?
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.280]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.080]   My goodness.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:51.240]   If I had a nickel for every time I had a woman say to me in counseling, "All I want is for
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.680]   my husband to love me," I'd make Bill Gates look like a poor man.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:02.560]   I mean, sincerely, she'll say to me, "All I want is for my husband to love me."
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.560]   Is that so bad?
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560]   No.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.120]   In fact, the Bible talks about that.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   Husbands love your wives.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.000]   Can it become a sinful, idolatrous desire in her heart?
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.040]   Absolutely.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.200]   How do you know?
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.120]   Because it's the first thing she thinks about when she gets up in the morning.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.080]   It's the last thing she thinks about before she goes to bed.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.920]   It consumes her thinking.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:35.520]   She craves it more than she craves being God's kind of wife, God's kind of woman.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.160]   She craves that more than anything else.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.040]   This dominates her thinking.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:45.760]   And when she doesn't receive the love that she believes that she deserves, then she becomes
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:53.360]   angry, hateful, mean, vindictive, verbal, or maybe she swings the other direction and
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:05.040]   becomes depressed, withdrawn, moody, non-communative, both sinful reactions because she's not receiving
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:12.600]   the love that she believes that she deserves, and it consumes her heart.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.200]   I'm not going to let the men off the hook, ladies.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:22.680]   How many times have I had a man say to me, "All I want is for my wife to respect me."
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   Is that so wrong?
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.680]   No.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.040]   The Bible talks about that.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:31.160]   In Ephesians 5, verse 32, "Wives, phobos."
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160]   That's the Greek term.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.280]   Phobos, your husbands, respect your husbands, reverence your husbands.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.320]   The Bible talks about that.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.680]   Can it become bad in his heart?
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.680]   Yes.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.600]   When he doesn't receive the respect that he believes he deserves, then he becomes angry,
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.360]   hateful, mean, vindictive.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:56.080]   He gets verbal and maybe even physical with her, or maybe he goes the other direction,
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:02.600]   withdraws, becomes moody, doesn't communicate anymore because he's not receiving the respect
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.000]   that he believes that he deserves.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.080]   That has become an idol in his life.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:15.080]   Wanting something that God wants, but wanting it so bad that it consumes your heart.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.680]   What about the Christian parent?
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:23.880]   What about the Christian parent who says this, "All I want is for my kids to love Jesus."
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.480]   Is that so wrong?
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480]   No?
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480]   Not wrong.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:33.320]   Can it become an idolatrous, consuming desire in that person's life?
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.120]   Absolutely it can.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.680]   That kid starts to grow up, becomes a teenager.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:45.440]   After you raise them, invested so much time and money and emotions and love in their direction,
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:53.400]   and they announce that they're walking away from the faith, you are crushed.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.440]   You're going, "I can't believe this.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.440]   This is my son.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.880]   This is my daughter, and they're walking away from the faith after I've invested so much
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   in them.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.960]   I took them to a great church.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.800]   I brought them up under the teaching of the Word of God.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.280]   How can they turn their backs on this?"
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:18.400]   When you all of a sudden see that happening in the life of your child, then when you see
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.600]   them walking away from the Lord, then you become angry and hateful and mean and vindictive
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.380]   and caustic with your child, or you swing the other direction and become moody.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.880]   You become withdrawn.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.900]   You become depressed all the time.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:40.240]   You don't see them following Jesus the way you and your spouse follow Jesus.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:49.080]   Wanting something that God wants, but wanting it so much that it controls my life.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.480]   It dominates my thinking.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   It dominates my heart, my purposes, my plans, my intentions.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.720]   It controls me.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.400]   Now it's become an idol.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.440]   I crave that more than I craved being God's kind of man or God's kind of woman or God's
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.960]   kind of husband or God's kind of wife or God's kind of father or God's kind of mother.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.760]   I crave that more than anything else.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:30.720]   That's wanting something that God wants, but wanting it so much, so badly that you become
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.300]   an ungodly person when you don't get it.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.640]   That shows that that's an idol.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.060]   That now has elevated itself.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:47.760]   That desire to have a spouse who loves you or a spouse who respects you or a child that
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:54.600]   loves Christ, now that becomes more important than being a godly man or woman.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:02.440]   So now that becomes the idol, that Christ now is second to that idol, as if my whole
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.880]   life, my whole pleasure and everything is wrapped up in my kid following Jesus when
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   it shouldn't be.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.280]   It should be wrapped up in Jesus.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:18.560]   It's not wrapped up in my kid following Jesus.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.840]   It's not wrapped up in my wife showing me respect.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.340]   It's not wrapped up in my husband showing me love.
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:34.360]   It's wrapped up in who Christ is and who I am in Christ.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:39.980]   That's where it is.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   What about this?
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:44.380]   Being controlled by expectations and becoming ungodly and thought, word, or deed when that
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:47.860]   expectation is not realized.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.860]   Listen to this.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:54.420]   Expectations are seedbeds for idols.
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:58.300]   Expectations are seedbeds to idols.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:05.020]   What we expect in life becomes now a demanding necessity.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:10.820]   I expect this to happen.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:15.980]   Sometimes when I'm teaching seminary classes, I'll say to some of our students, I'll say,
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:21.220]   "Listen, I know what some of you guys are thinking.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:25.780]   I'm not Jesus, but I know what's going on in your head."
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:30.500]   Look at me like, "You've worked all day.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.420]   You slaved around in library.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.660]   You've been writing papers.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:38.900]   You're doing your Greek and Hebrew exegesis and you're sweating blood all over the place
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.060]   and you're thinking to yourself, 'Man, I am working so hard.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:45.300]   My wife appreciates this.
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:50.860]   In fact, she's at home probably right now fixing a large dinner for me.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:59.180]   And when I get home, I can't wait to have a big roast beef dinner with piles of mashed
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:02.740]   potatoes and gravy and piles of peas.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:05.460]   And I just can't wait to be there."
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.900]   So he's all excited.
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.260]   He thinks about this all day long.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.260]   She really loves me.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:12.260]   She really appreciates me.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.260]   This is what's going to happen.
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:17.540]   So he comes busting through the door at the end of the day.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:21.060]   He doesn't smell any roast beef.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.740]   All he smells is dirty diapers.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:34.220]   And all of a sudden he starts to think, "What has she been doing all day?
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:37.440]   What has she been doing?
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.540]   I mean, I have been slaving myself to the bone.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:45.020]   In seminary, I have been writing all these papers and I've been doing all this work and
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.500]   I've been doing all this research.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.460]   My eyes are about ready to fall out of my head.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.420]   I've been reading and reading book after book after book.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:55.740]   And what is she doing at home?"
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:03.060]   And so you yell upstairs, "Sweetheart, where's dinner?"
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:12.140]   She says, "There's some lunch meat in the refrigerator.
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:18.080]   Get your own sandwich."
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.240]   She doesn't appreciate me.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.660]   She doesn't appreciate me at all.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:27.300]   If she appreciated me, this wouldn't be happening.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:30.500]   Expectations are seed beds to idols.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:38.460]   Whatever you're expecting in life, those are the seed beds that set you up for a fall.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.460]   What do you expect?
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.660]   What do you expect in your life?
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:44.700]   What do you expect in your relationship with that other person?
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:45.700]   What are they?
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.180]   Are those really godly expectations?
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:51.860]   Listen, if I understand the Bible correctly, I hope I do here, but if I understand the
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:30:02.540]   Bible correctly, we must radically lower our expectations about other people and life itself
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:12.820]   and raise our expectations about what we should be like in terms of godliness.
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:13.820]   Here's another one.
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:14.820]   What about this?
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.460]   Fourth, perceiving a deserved right and following through with ungodly thoughts, words, and
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:23.460]   actions to try to get it when that right is denied.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.980]   Wow.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:26.780]   Americans love rights.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.260]   We even have a bill of rights.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:36.940]   We have a bill of rights.
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.740]   We set up certain rights.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:42.180]   Well, I have a right to fill in the blank, whatever it is.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.060]   I have a right to mm-mm.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.460]   I have a right to mm-mm.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:58.380]   What do you think your heart says I have a right to?
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:11.540]   If you really understand the way Scripture pictures you and I, we have one right, and
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:12.540]   that's to burn in hell.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.380]   It's the only right we have.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:23.220]   We have one right, burn in hell.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:30.660]   Back a few years ago, I was up doing a lecture with a bunch of Berkeley students.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:36.420]   Some of them were not believers, so we had a Q&A afterwards, and one of them raised their
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:39.220]   hand.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:46.460]   How can you believe that there's a God there that's good when there are terrible disasters
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:54.600]   that occur, tsunamis, thousands of people die, earthquakes, fires, floods?
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.220]   How can you believe that?
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:07.860]   My natural response automatic is, "Wow, that makes me believe it even more in Him."
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:11.380]   How is that possible?
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:17.300]   Simply from the standpoint that your question assumes that all of us deserve to live.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:20.760]   In reality, all of us deserve to die.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:30.100]   God could take away all life on this planet and not for a nanosecond cease to be righteous.
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:37.180]   The very fact that He preserves any of us shows us His mercy.
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.460]   Every fact that He does that.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:42.140]   So your question is predicated on a false assumption.
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.860]   The assumption is we deserve to live.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.900]   No we don't.
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.740]   Where do you get that idea?
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:52.460]   We don't deserve to live.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:56.700]   And it can only come out of a pagan mindset.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.580]   That's the only way it can come.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:07.220]   If you understand God as being absolutely holy, absolutely just, and also absolutely
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:14.460]   loving, that's the only thing that makes sense.
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:18.540]   Where's this thing we have to have a right?
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:22.820]   Or look at this, believing in something, a standard or rule that is not of God that leads
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.500]   to ungodly practices.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:29.420]   You know we can elevate a standard or a rule to non-compromisable biblical level and think
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:35.860]   that it's equal to the Bible and then all of a sudden that becomes an idol in our life.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:39.700]   You go into a lot of youth groups today, you want to start a war in a youth group, just
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:44.220]   talk about dating, courting, or betrothal.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:48.460]   And they all claim biblical authority.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.940]   All three of them claim biblical authority.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:54.060]   Well there's no dating in the Bible, there's no courting in the Bible, there is betrothal
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:57.860]   in the Bible, but if you're going to practice betrothal, you have to be consistent with
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:58.860]   the way of the Bible.
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:05.060]   If you think that's normative for all believers of all time, if that's what you think, then
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:15.180]   remember when David was betrothed, or Michael was betrothed to David, then Saul gave him
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:19.620]   this impossible standard, "Give me the four skins of a hundred Philistines and you can
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:23.020]   have my daughter," which was an almost impossible task.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:25.380]   David did it.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:30.020]   He did it.
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.060]   Now I had two daughters.
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:40.140]   I could have said to my future son-in-laws, "Listen, give me the four skins of a hundred
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:48.860]   Christian psychologists."
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:53.620]   And that would put a pretty good dent in the United States in Christian psychology.
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.980]   "Give me four skins of that."
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:01.140]   Now I didn't do that, but if I was practicing betrothal, I'd have to carry it through here.
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:03.580]   No, no, none of it.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:08.500]   But we raise those standards, we raise those particular standards to an uncompromisable
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.500]   biblical level.
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.580]   And that particular time, when we do those kind of things, then those things become our
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.740]   idols.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:18.540]   We expect everybody else to obey them too, because that's something that I've come to
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.540]   a conclusion.
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:20.540]   Well, that's fine.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.540]   If you come to a conclusion on that, that's wonderful.
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:24.860]   Good, you can do that.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:32.380]   But just don't universalize it to everybody else.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:40.540]   Or thinking or having a mindset that is against the truth of God's Word that leads to ungodliness
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:47.540]   and thoughts and words and actions, any kind of a mindset whatsoever that is in your mind,
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:54.780]   because of time I've got to run on this one, but listen, "I must have or not have," whatever
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:59.620]   that is in that question mark area is your idol.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:05.740]   What is your heart saying, "I must have or not have," now becomes your ruling desire,
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:14.520]   your functional God, your controlling inner cravings that are my idolatrous cravings.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:22.040]   Whatever that is, is your idol.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.560]   Now go back to James chapter 4.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:33.140]   No wonder James says, "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you?
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:38.880]   Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members."
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:46.320]   It's what you want more than anything else that is not of Christ.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:54.940]   When Christ is not worshipped in your heart, you're set up for conflict.
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.040]   You're set up for conflict.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:05.240]   Well, we have much more to say about this, but the clock is my enemy.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.240]   So we've got to stop there and let's bow for prayer.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:17.000]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for your goodness, for helping us see our own
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   hearts.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.320]   It's as if the Scripture is the functional magnetic resonance imaging program of the
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:29.920]   metaphorical heart, because now we're able to see what's really going on, what's ruling
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:36.640]   and controlling me, those desires that I think are going to bring me pleasure, those must-haves
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:43.280]   or must-not-haves that tend to rule me more than Christ.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:48.800]   These are the very things that set the stage for conflict.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:58.360]   Help us to be godly in response to exegete our heart and learn the importance of repentance.
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.440]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:10.120]   Let's all stand for the closing prayer.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:30.760]   I was a boy who was lost at the bar Running away when I hit your car
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:39.720]   Father, you were a joke I had no righteousness of my own
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:46.720]   I had no right to draw near your throne Father, you lost me still
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:55.720]   And in love before you laid the world's foundation
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:39:08.720]   You predestined to adopt me as your own You have raised me up so high above my station
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:19.720]   I'm a child of God by grace, grace alone I hope to seek out the lost
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:29.720]   You knew the great and terrible cost That Jesus, your face, was set
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   I worked my fingers down to the bone Nothing I did could ever atone
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:48.720]   Jesus, you paid my debt By your blood I have redemption and salvation
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:55.720]   Old you died that I might reap what you have sown
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:02.720]   And you rose that I might be a new creation
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.720]   I am born again by grace, grace alone
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:17.720]   I was a dark, I was a dark soul of my life I never knew the day from the night
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:27.720]   Spirit, you made me see I swore I knew the way on my own
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:34.720]   A head full of rocks, a heart made of stone Spirit, you moved in
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:43.720]   Natural touch, natural touch The sleeping spirit was awakened
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:50.720]   On my darkened heart the light of Christ was shown
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:41:03.720]   Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken Heaven's citizen by grace, grace alone
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:17.720]   So I'll stand to faith by grace, grace alone I will run for raise by grace, grace alone
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:33.720]   I will slay my sin by grace, grace alone I will reach the end by grace, grace alone
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:41.720]   Amen. Let's close this session by praying together.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   All right, God, we thank you for the call that you give to us, God, to be like you, Lord, to emulate your character.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.720]   We recognize, Lord, there is much, much work to be done in purifying our hearts,
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:06.720]   allowing your careful eyes to examine us, the thoughts and intentions, but importantly, God, the many things we desire.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:15.720]   Father God, we collectively repent of the fact that in many seasons we just instinctually do and say whatever it is we want.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:23.720]   But I pray, Father God, that those desires would thoroughly be washed by your word and spirit to make sure that it is of you,
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.720]   God, that is for your purposes and that ultimately, Lord, is something pleasing in your sight.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.720]   I pray, Father God, because our hearts often are locked up and accustomed to our own way,
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   that you would help us through this process of examination and, God, that you would continue to lead us.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.720]   So we thank you so much, Lord, for this time. It's in Christ and we pray. Amen.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:50.720]   You may all take a seat and then I'm going to invite Jason to give us some more announcements for what's up ahead.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:59.720]   [Silence]
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   All right, before we dismiss you guys for your small groups, just a couple announcements.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   When you guys meet for your small group time, you can meet out in the foyer area, you can meet in here,
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.720]   and you can also meet in the dining halls, but just make sure you put the chairs back to how originally it was when you guys shifted around.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:20.720]   For Spock Young's small group, Susan Fong-Gray will now be leading your small group, so look for her.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   And also, another reminder to make sure you guys time it accordingly so you guys can pick up the kids from the nursery at 1140, 1150.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:40.720]   And we understand it's a short time for the small group time, so maybe you guys can extend the time into the lunch time at 12 o'clock, okay?
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:41.720]   Thanks guys.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:41.960]   guys.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.800]   Thank you.
