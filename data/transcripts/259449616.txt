[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   All right.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans 12, we're continuing our series
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.640]   in the qualities of biblical love.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.200]   Romans 12, and again, I want to read starting from verse 9 down to verse 13
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.080]   for today.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.320]   "Let love be genuine.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.720]   Abhor what is evil, hold fast to what is good, love one another with brotherly
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.320]   affection, outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.400]   Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.480]   rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.240]   contribute to the needs of the saints, and seek to show hospitality."
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.360]   Let's pray.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.320]   Lord, you truly are deserving of all honor, all praise, all glory.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.200]   The more we think and the more we study of your word, the more we experience
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.200]   your grace, we want to honor you.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.680]   We want the world to know, Father God, what kind of God we serve.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.400]   We pray, Father God, that the preaching of your word will be accompanied by the power
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.440]   of your spirit, Lord, in our hearts, that those who hear,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.840]   that those seed would fall on fertile soil, that it may bear fruit 30, 60, 100 fold,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.320]   and that it would rise up to greater and more sincere worship to your name.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080]   So we pray, Father, you would anoint this time.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.080]   Amen.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.760]   Can you do me a favor and just take it down just a little bit?
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.880]   I hear my own voice ringing in my ear.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.360]   Okay, thank you.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.720]   All right.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.080]   As you guys know, we are studying through a book of Romans and we're in the section
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.200]   where Apostle Paul is challenging us to apply the things that he's been talking about.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.520]   Justification leads to sanctification.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.280]   And so sanctification, the priority in sanctification, the highest priority,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880]   he talks about using our gift to build up one another.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.920]   And ultimately, it's explained in love, that the greatest quality of any Christian,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.960]   the greatest application of any sanctification is ultimately love.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.200]   You can have prayer, you can have evangelism, you can have sacrifice,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.800]   you can be generous in giving and making disciples, yet you do not have love.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.880]   It says it is absolutely nothing.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.080]   It is meaningless because the ultimate goal of all of this is to love.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.000]   2 Peter 1, 5 through 9.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.680]   I think I have the verse up here.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.200]   2 Peter 1, 5 through 9.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   You don't have that?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.160]   Maybe I didn't give that to you.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.880]   2 Peter 1, 5 through 9, if you can turn to that passage, basically it sums up where
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.640]   Peter says, for this very reason, considering the gift that we have in Christ,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.280]   considering the justification, make every effort to supplement.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.360]   And again, some of your translation says to add, right?
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   And it's no different what Paul is saying in chapter 12, considering his mercy,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.800]   considering the great salvation that we have.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.560]   He says, supplement, add to your faith with virtue and with virtue knowledge,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920]   and with knowledge, with self-control, and with self-control,
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.160]   with steadfastness, and with steadfastness, godliness, and with godliness,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   brotherly affection, and with brotherly affection, with love.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.960]   Let me stop right there.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.240]   So if you notice what Peter is doing here, he's laying down in reverse order that
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.880]   sanctification, if you apply these things, add to your faith,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.960]   add to your confession of justification, are striving after sanctification.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.440]   And it says, if you have virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.600]   godliness, and ultimately leading to brotherly love, and brotherly love
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   leading to love, agape.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.720]   Does that remind you a lot of what he said in verse 10 of chapter 12?
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.360]   And he says, love one another with brotherly affection, outdo one another
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.440]   in showing honor, in love.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.240]   So again, Peter is saying in the reverse order that the goal
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.320]   of sanctification is love.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.400]   So if you have discipleship, discipline, and prayer, and giving, and all of that,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.000]   and it ultimately doesn't lead you to greater love, agape love,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.480]   unconditional love, all of that is for nothing.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.200]   All we have become is greater religious people.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   All you have become is greater disciplined people, that you know more theology,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.280]   you know how to play the game.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.800]   But in the end, if it doesn't produce the character of Christ,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.120]   then it is for nothing.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.240]   And then he says in verse 8, for if these qualities are yours
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.720]   and are increasing, meaning that it's not like, well, I have these things,
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.520]   and I've worked on it, and now my job is to tell other people.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.640]   No, he says every Christian that this quality should be constantly increasing.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.200]   Our sanctification is not going to be done until we are actually glorified.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.120]   If these qualities are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.160]   or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.480]   meaning that you have a personal relationship with God,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.040]   and yet you don't see the sanctification happening,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   and you're not actively pursuing these things,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.560]   he says you become ineffective, unfruitful.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.320]   And then he gives the explanation of why this doesn't take place
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.080]   in some people's lives in verse 9.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.840]   For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.120]   and having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.080]   So what is the reason why somebody wouldn't be pursuing this?
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.800]   He says he's blind, he's nearsighted.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.480]   Now I was thinking about what does it mean to be nearsighted?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.920]   Nearsighted is somebody who cannot see from a distance.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.400]   He only sees things up close.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.200]   So basically what he's saying is the reason why an individual is not actively
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.240]   pursuing his faith, his sanctification, and is not actively trying to love somebody
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.880]   is because all they see is what is right in front of them.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.160]   I think we can all relate to that.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.880]   The greatest distraction in our lives, there's lust, there's temptation,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.560]   there's compromise, all these things are all true.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.360]   But on a day-to-day basis, what causes us to be ineffective
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.520]   is we are nearsighted.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.000]   All we pay attention to is what is right in front of us.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.720]   The distraction of paying bills, the distraction of raising kids,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.440]   the distraction of the next thing that's coming down the line.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.560]   And so we don't have a larger picture of what Christ has done and what it is that
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.720]   we have in Christ and what is that ultimately going to lead to when I die.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   We're only living for today.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.400]   If I do this, I'm going to get a better job.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.080]   If I do this, this is for my kids.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.200]   If I do this, I'm going to be able to invest in stock or whatever it may be.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.040]   He said he is nearsighted.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.080]   He is living as if he has forgotten what it is that he has in Christ.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.840]   So every week, you come to Bible study, you come to church, and
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.960]   you have to be constantly reminded, do you not know what it is that you have in
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.480]   Christ?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.280]   Because you forget.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.800]   As soon as the service is over, you forget.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.280]   Soon as you get into your car, you turn on the radio, you forget.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.480]   Soon as you go to your job, you forget.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.200]   He says it's because you are nearsighted.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.920]   All you are looking at is what is right in front of you today.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.640]   That's why it is so important that we never forget.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.640]   In view of God's mercy, what it is that you have in Christ, you and I,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:45.840]   every professing Christian whose sins have been forgiven, you are a child of God.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.480]   The God who created the universe says you are co-heirs with Christ.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   And your inheritance can never fade, spoil, or perish.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.560]   Guarded for you in eternity.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.040]   And that even when you sin, he says he has a way to forgive you of your sin,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.880]   cleanse you of all your unrighteousness.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.160]   Anybody who professes to believe that and
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.000]   responds by saying, okay, I already know that.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.360]   How many times are you going to tell me that?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.000]   Can we move on to something else?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.160]   Tell me something different.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.280]   I've already heard that, I've known that.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.720]   I've been in church 20 some years.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.320]   I actually teach Bible study.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.960]   I'm a Sunday school teacher, I'm a leader at this church.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.360]   We can easily say, well, I know all of this, and then what?
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.560]   Anybody, in my opinion, anybody who responds that way, to me,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.200]   it makes me question, do you understand what it is that you just said?
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.320]   The Son of God came and died for you on the cross, forgave you of your sins.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.600]   He has inheritance waiting for you, guarded by him.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.080]   The Holy Spirit is interceding on your behalf.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.440]   Son of God himself has become the high priest that we are able to have
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.200]   access to him with confidence.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.400]   And we hear that and we say, okay, now what?
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:22.000]   That response, not only is it inappropriate,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.680]   it makes us suspect of the genuineness of our faith.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.440]   So that's why he says, a person who's not actively pursuing this,
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   who's not desiring to apply this to love, is because he is blind.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.080]   It's because he's nearsighted.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.960]   All they're concerned about is today.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.240]   What today is gonna bring for tomorrow,
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.640]   because he has forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.880]   It's always been around, this false teaching, false theology,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.480]   false gospel has always been around.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   Because usually the false gospel isn't off by a lot.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.920]   The false gospel usually doesn't go directly and say, I don't believe in Jesus.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.600]   He wasn't resurrected from the dead.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.760]   I don't think he's a child of God.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.400]   Usually, false gospel that usually is very effective in deceiving people
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.960]   is only off by a hairline.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.360]   It's only slightly off.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.240]   There's so much truth in it that it's hard for us to identify what is and isn't.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.880]   And the two main heresies that the New Testament constantly deals with
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.560]   is the Judaizers and the Gnostics.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.760]   So the Gnostics, the Christian Gnostics, were from the secular camp,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.560]   from the Gentiles.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.240]   Basically, their main teaching was, flesh is evil and the spirit is good.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.920]   So whatever you do with the flesh, he's already condemned.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.080]   So you can do whatever with the flesh because Jesus Christ came and delivered
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.040]   you in the spirit.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.920]   So the application of that was, it doesn't matter how you live because one
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.720]   saved always saved.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.160]   You're saved.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.600]   He didn't save our flesh, he saved our spirit because these two things can coexist.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.360]   And then you had the Judaizers saying that, well, if you really want to be saved,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.720]   you have to go through this program.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.920]   You have to be circumcised.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.200]   You have to keep the Sabbath.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.320]   You have to do all of these convocations.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   And so they were perverting the gospel by adding, and then the Gnostics were
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.760]   perverting the gospel by subtracting.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.200]   But either way, either of these false gospels were leading to disobedience.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.160]   And Paul says, "Let him be anathema," because once you mess with the gospel,
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.280]   you've messed with salvation.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   You've messed with God himself.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.080]   The reason why I say this is because, you know, especially...I don't think this is
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.600]   only true in our generation or where we live, but there is a specific disdain
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:06.000]   toward any kind of rebuke in our generation, of any kind.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.960]   And if someone feels guilty over their sins, that in and of itself is sin.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.920]   Feeling guilty for sins is a sin.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.280]   I don't know how many times I've counseled somebody to sit down and say,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.440]   "It is not."
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.960]   Let me give you a perfect example of that.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.040]   In 1 Corinthians, Apostle Paul is rebuking this church, right?
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.880]   I don't know what kind of rebuke that you may have heard, but read 1 Corinthians if
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.800]   you want to feel rebuked.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.080]   1 Corinthians starts with rebuke and it ends with rebuke.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.440]   And all throughout it, he says, "What is wrong with you?
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.080]   Why are you acting like you're worldly?
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   Why are you divided?
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.440]   Do you not know that you are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.880]   And whoever destroys the temple, he will be destroyed?"
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.400]   I mean, it's harsh criticism.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Because of that, there's sin in the church and they were relying on all kinds of sin
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.480]   to just take place in the church.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.920]   Their communion table actually was dividing the church.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.480]   People who were prophesying were standing up and say, "Well, God's talking to me,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.800]   so I'm going to speak out of turn."
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.320]   And, you know, and it was just creating all kinds of chaos in the church.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.040]   So Paul comes down as harsh as you can possibly imagine, right?
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.920]   Of all the letters, 1 Corinthians is the harshest letter.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.720]   And then he begins 2 Corinthians as a response to this first letter because there were two
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.760]   different responses to that letter.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.720]   The first response was they felt guilty.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.800]   They were cut to the heart.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.220]   And as a result of that, it caused them, this guilt led to repentance.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.800]   And so Paul says, "You know, I regretted it for a little bit because I was so harsh
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.360]   with you, but I did not regret it because I see what it did to you.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.480]   It brought you to repentance and brought you to restoration."
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.640]   And so now he encourages them, "That brother, that guy that I was telling you to shun him
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.960]   from the church, now embrace him and love him in repentance."
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.360]   That was the first group.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.600]   The rebuke led to repentance.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:15.420]   Their guilt led to godly sorrow, which led to repentance and restoration and redemption.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:21.380]   And then the second group responded to that by saying, "Well, this guy's letter is so
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.540]   strong, but his presence is weak."
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.860]   And they didn't like what he had to say.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.860]   And so what they did was they didn't want to live with this guilt and they didn't want
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.100]   to repent.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.140]   So what they did was they began to question Paul.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.340]   Maybe this guy is not from God.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.740]   We don't need to listen to this guy.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.840]   He's not speaking from God.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.220]   So 2 Corinthians is written to defend his apostleship against people who didn't like
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.220]   his rebuke.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.960]   There were two responses.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.520]   One led to repentance, godly sorrow led to repentance, and the other was who didn't want
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.740]   to repent, basically saying, "That guy is not an apostle."
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.120]   That's not unique to the New Testament.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.320]   That happened all throughout church history.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.060]   And it happens today.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.660]   Now, the reason why I say all of this is because if we don't have the proper understanding
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:18.780]   of the gospel, if you think that active sanctification is not something that a Christian should be
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.740]   embracing because we're saved so we don't need to worry, sanctification is just going
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.380]   to happen, so I don't want to hear that, "Just tell me what Jesus did.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.060]   Don't tell me what I need to do."
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.540]   Read the Bible for yourself.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.100]   He says, "Because that person is nearsighted."
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.300]   The reason why he's not pursuing God is because he has forgotten what it is that he has in
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.420]   Christ, and he's not drawing near to Christ.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.340]   He wants his life left alone as it is.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:55.740]   Ultimately, the right gospel will lead us to passionate pursuit of Christ.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.960]   Why wouldn't you want to have an intimate fellowship with a God who loves you beyond
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.700]   what you can comprehend?
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:10.140]   Why wouldn't you want to commune with a God who knows everything about you, and yet he
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.100]   sent his only begotten Son to die for you?
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.940]   Why wouldn't somebody who professes to know this God, who's opened access to this throne
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:28.020]   of mercy, we try so hard to pay so much money to get the best seats to watch a measly concert,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:35.180]   and yet make so little effort to be in the presence of this holy God who loves us?
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.300]   It's because we have become nearsighted.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.420]   We have forgotten what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.380]   That's the point that he was trying to make.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:51.260]   The motivation behind why we actively pursue God is the gospel itself, is what we sing
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260]   about itself.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:59.620]   It is what we already have in Christ, to enjoy it.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.420]   Not to just sing about it, not to just talk about it, not just memorize it, but to enjoy
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:09.700]   the salvation that God has given you, to come into the throne of grace.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:21.180]   No one buys a ticket to the Game 7 World Series $4,000 ticket and then sits at home and just
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.700]   talks about the ticket, celebrates the ticket.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.100]   Look at the ticket, take a picture of the ticket, put it on Facebook, let everybody
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.540]   see you have the ticket.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.140]   The point of the ticket is for you to go.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:44.340]   The ticket, the expensive, ridiculous ticket that was so hard to get, you have it, so you
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.500]   can go.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.860]   So it doesn't make sense for Christians to take pictures of Bible verses, sing songs,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:58.100]   go to church, talk about it, have Bible studies, yet they don't go.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.420]   They don't go into the presence of God.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.260]   They're not actively pursuing God.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.860]   That's what he means.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.060]   The reason why he's not doing that is because you become nearsighted.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.580]   You forgot what it is that you have.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.660]   You forgot what it is that God is holding on for you.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.060]   Ultimately, that's the motivation.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.620]   I haven't even started the message yet.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.140]   That's the motivation because without that motivation, everything else that he's going
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:28.260]   to say is going to just sound like, "What is wrong with you people?"
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.260]   Do it.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.260]   Just do it.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.420]   Do more of it.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.420]   Do more of it.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.220]   Oh, you guys love one another.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.220]   That's great.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.300]   But do more and more.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.500]   That's all you're going to hear if you don't understand what it is that he's calling us
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.660]   to do and why we do what we do.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.260]   It is an act.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.980]   It is a reasonable response.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.420]   Someone who is not nearsighted.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.140]   Someone who is affected by the love of Christ.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:03.420]   Someone who is eager for Christ to come, to be redeemed from this fallen world.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.940]   Let me get to the point here because I only have one this morning.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.900]   I had two and then I boomed it down to one because we have baby dedication, second service,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.260]   so I had to shorten it.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:19.700]   And I didn't want to just skim through these things because every one of these points,
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.700]   there's so many things.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.020]   I mean, he just calls them, he just 24 imperative statements, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.660]   boom, but every one of these statements are principles and teachings of Jesus that are
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.500]   expounded in other places in detail.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.620]   So I don't want to just state it and then just move on.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.620]   What's the hurry anyway?
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.620]   Where do you have to go?
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.620]   All right.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.620]   We'll take our time.
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.900]   So the principle number 11, biblical love contributes to the needs of the saints and
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.580]   seeks to show hospitality.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.300]   Biblical love contributes to the needs of the saints and seeks to show hospitality.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.380]   The interesting thing here, the word for contribute or some of your Bible say share, the Greek
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.100]   word is koinoneo.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.940]   I think a lot of you already kind of nodding your head because you know what that word
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.940]   means.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.860]   It means to fellowship, where we get the word fellowship.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.300]   And that literal understanding of that word is to partner together.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:22.700]   So I talked about in last week, Philemon verse 6, where Paul says to Philemon that he's praying
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.660]   that the sharing of his faith would become effective in the knowledge of Christ.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.820]   And again, we talked about the sharing of his faith.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.260]   He wasn't simply talking about evangelism.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.780]   He's talking about living out, right, living out his faith and being gracious and merciful
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:45.460]   and loving that in that context to receive Onesimus as a runaway slave, as a brother.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.520]   So he uses that word koinoneo, to share, to partner.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.140]   In Philippians chapter 1, 6, Paul says of the Philippian church, and he's writing this
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.180]   letter because of their partnership in the gospel.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:02.020]   And that word for partnership there is koinoneo, to fellowship.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   Again, so it's very different than the way that you and I use the word fellowship in
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.020]   our culture.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:12.220]   Fellowship, if two Christians get together, go shopping, get some boba, it's fellowship.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.060]   You play some basketball, fellowship.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.620]   We had board games, fellowship.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.840]   Ping pong, fellowship.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.140]   So I'm not saying that they can't be fellowship.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.980]   All of that stuff can be fellowship if it is working toward partnering.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.800]   We're partnering, we're sharing, we're spurring one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.700]   If you ask an average Christian, what of the four disciplines, you have the prayer, you
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.500]   have the word, you have evangelism, and you have fellowship, you ask an average Christian,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.700]   what are they usually good at?
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:49.780]   At least in where we live, we said, we're really good at fellowship.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.220]   We're really good at fellowship.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.020]   We're kind of weak in prayer.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.020]   Evangelism is almost non-existent.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.660]   Word, I get it at church, if you go to church.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.700]   That's usually how we think we are.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.380]   If you apply the biblical understanding of fellowship, most Christians are pretty weak.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:15.700]   I would say the word, at least where we are, is probably higher above fellowship.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.240]   And the reason why I say that is because when you really understand what this fellowship
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.460]   means to partner together, where you're deliberately spurring on one another, not spending time
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.540]   together, not having fun together, again, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.760]   I'm not saying that Christians should be killjoy.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.060]   We should have fun with each other.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.100]   I hope Christians getting together is not a drudgery.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.540]   It's a good thing.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.940]   But if all it is is just spending time together, that has nothing to do with fellowship, not
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.580]   biblically.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.620]   Partnering together, sharing with one another, and the specific context that Paul uses the
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:57.520]   word koinonia is sharing of what we have, which obviously the most tangible thing is
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.900]   the material good.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.340]   The material good, sharing with one another.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:08.660]   In Galatians 6, it says, "Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ."
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:15.580]   Fellowship, true fellowship, biblical fellowship, where brotherly love is leading to agape,
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.140]   is what God calls us to do.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.580]   That fulfills the law of Christ.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:27.940]   So if you think about in the book of Genesis, when they sin, what was the immediate thing
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.020]   that you saw happen?
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.020]   Immediate.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.740]   Did Adam and Eve just fall to the ground and die?
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.100]   That didn't happen.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.780]   You and I wouldn't be here.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.820]   What's the immediate thing that happened?
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.940]   Fellowship with God was broken.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.700]   Fellowship with God was broken, and then husband and wife, the intimacy between husband and
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.020]   wife was broken.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:55.140]   So fellowship was broken between the two, because they had to hide from each other.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.820]   And that was the result of the fall, that when sin comes in, it destroys fellowship.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.780]   So those of you who are studying Leviticus with us, the peace offering represented the
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.220]   restoration of this fellowship.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.420]   Restoration with God and restoration with mankind.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.820]   So you give an offering, and then that offering leads to picnic.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.620]   And it was to remind the nation of Israel, true fellowship can't be had until there is
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   true fellowship with God.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.820]   And that's what that peace offering was teaching the nation of Israel.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:31.620]   Paul is saying here, this biblical love leads to fellowship, true fellowship, meeting the
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.460]   needs of the saints, and to seek to show hospitality.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.380]   In fact, we see that in the early church.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.220]   In the very beginning of the book of Acts, when the Holy Spirit comes upon them, one
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.620]   of the evidence of the Holy Spirit was that they were fellowshipping, genuine fellowship,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:55.060]   in Acts 2, 40, 45, and all who believed were together in all things in common.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.660]   They were partnering and sharing with one another in material goods, and they were selling
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.060]   their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.620]   That's how the early church was described.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.580]   When the Holy Spirit came upon them and they were convicted, the first thing that they
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.140]   did, they became very generous.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.460]   Acts chapter 4, 32 to 36.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.100]   Now the full number of those who believed were one heart and one soul.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:25.360]   No one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.660]   But they had everything in common.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.940]   And with great power, the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.860]   Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.140]   There was not a needy person among them.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.420]   For as many as were owners of lands and houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.340]   was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.420]   need.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.680]   That's how the early church was described.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.460]   When they were affected by the cross, one of the first evidence of it was they became
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.420]   very generous.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:04.140]   There's reasons why these professional athletes who come from very difficult backgrounds,
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:09.180]   and so many of them come from backgrounds where they were living in poverty, and if
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.780]   you talk to them about, you know, they were a single family home and mom had to work three
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:19.380]   jobs just to make it, and then they come to the NBA, and all of a sudden they're multi-multi-millionaires.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.740]   And so you see so many of them out on their community.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.080]   They set up charities, they're always giving, they're going back to their hometown and setting
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.260]   up schools and all that.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.560]   They become very generous.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.440]   The reason why they're so generous is because they know what it is that they have.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.420]   They were given the genetic lottery and they won.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   And so they know that what they had, that it wasn't like 50 years of hard work.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.100]   Instantaneously, because they were good at dribbling the ball and putting the ball in
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.260]   the hoop, and they were better than anybody else, right?
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.380]   And it wasn't because they were better people.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.340]   They won the genetic lottery, and so as a result of that, all this wealth that they
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.540]   had, they become very generous.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.060]   In fact, some of them are so generous that they lose all their money by the time they
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.380]   come out, you know, and you hear stories about these athletes who made like $100 million
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.100]   and they have nothing in their pocket because they weren't wise with their money, because
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.620]   they were just so generous with their friends and their family and everybody.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.540]   The reason why the early church became so generous is because they understood what it
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.380]   is that they had in Christ.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.180]   They won the spiritual lottery.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.100]   They didn't do anything, they weren't better people than the people who didn't.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.020]   It was just by God's sovereign choice.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.060]   They heard the gospel and they believed and they were convicted, and all of a sudden the
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:51.980]   Holy Spirit in them started working powerfully, and as a result of that, they became generous.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.900]   They understood what it is that they had in Christ.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.340]   So compared to what it is they had in Christ, this material stuff just didn't look that
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.820]   appealing to them, just like what Apostle Paul says.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:10.660]   In light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, everything else became rubbish.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:19.020]   Anybody who is in love with the world, we don't have to go through spiritual assessment,
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.980]   we don't have to list all the things that you're doing wrong.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:26.620]   Automatically, we know that Christ is not that appealing to you.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.020]   I don't need to sit there and do three years of biblical counseling to find out why you
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.620]   love the world.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.860]   It's pretty simple.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:43.380]   Because Christ isn't that appealing to you.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.940]   That really is a simple reason why we don't pursue Christ.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.060]   We can say everything we want, we can have the right doctrines, go to the right church,
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:56.500]   but it's just, he's not as appealing as you say he is.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:05.700]   See the early church, when they met Christ, I mean, and I want you to understand that
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.420]   this is not promotion of communism.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.980]   You're going to say, "Well, it sounds like communism.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.660]   They sold everything and they distributed it for everybody else.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.860]   They said none of this is mine.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   That's communism.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.860]   That's China.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:21.980]   Actually, even China is in communism right now, right?"
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.260]   Understand that this was not required.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.940]   The apostle didn't say, "Hey, sell all your possessions, give it to the poor."
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.940]   He didn't say that.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.940]   It was not required.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:34.380]   In fact, remember the very first sin that's being dealt with in Acts chapter 5, Ananias
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.460]   and Sapphira, they look at all the people who are being generous and instead of being
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.180]   really motivated to honor God, they're like, "Okay, maybe I should do this."
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.380]   And so they sold their possession, right?
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.580]   And they give half of it and say, "Here's all of it."
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.020]   And as a result of that lie, what happens?
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.020]   Capital punishment.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.060]   Both of them fall down and they die.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.940]   And this is how Peter describes it, Acts chapter 5, 3-4.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:05.060]   But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:09.100]   keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.860]   While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?"
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.700]   In other words, we never asked you to do that, right?
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.940]   And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal?
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.860]   After it was sold, it was not required of you to do that.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.860]   Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart?
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.780]   You have not lied to men, but to God.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.420]   So Peter basically is telling them this was not required to do.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.020]   God was not establishing communism.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.020]   So when the other people were doing it, they were doing it out of the abundance of their
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.380]   heart because of what Christ has done.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:52.260]   But in light of the surpassing knowledge of known Jesus Christ, the world seemed to look
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.260]   like rubbish.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.080]   It wasn't anything.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.380]   It was greater to share and to glorify Christ than to hold on to and hoard it.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.700]   So they voluntarily did it.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.500]   See, that was the early church.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   When we are affected by what Christ has done, it causes people to be motivated to be generous.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:21.940]   And that's what he's saying, that biblical love leads to fellowship, contribution.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.900]   In fact, remember James 2?
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   Remember that?
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.780]   It said, "Faith without deeds is dead."
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.020]   You can profess to have faith, but if your life doesn't back it up, it's dead.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.020]   It's useless.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.020]   It's just meanness.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.180]   Even the demons, remember when they saw Jesus, they fell on their grounds.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.340]   They said, "Son of God, why have you come before the time to torment us?"
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.540]   They recognized him right away.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.600]   They confessed orthodoxy.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.900]   They confessed the right doctrine, right identity, Christology, when they met him.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.460]   He said, "If all your faith is just a confession of orthodoxy, it is no different than the
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.460]   demons."
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.700]   So James says, "Faith without deeds is dead."
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.140]   Well, what deed is he referring to?
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.580]   James 2.14.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.060]   And if you've ever studied the book of James, you'll notice that this theme is all throughout
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.260]   the book of James.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.060]   There was a problem with the rich and the poor, where the poor were envious of the rich,
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.700]   and the rich were looking down at the poor, and the rich would come in, they would get
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.060]   special seats, and poor people were not getting treated well.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:30.460]   And so the whole thing that he was dealing with in the book of James is this problem
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.100]   of the rich and the poor.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.340]   And he says, "What good is it, my brother, if someone says that he has faith and does
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.980]   not have works?"
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.260]   Can that faith save him?
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.820]   He's not saying that you have to have faith and works.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.380]   He's saying, is that faith genuine?
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:51.580]   If somebody says that he has faith and it doesn't produce any works, is that real faith?
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.580]   Could that really be faith?
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.580]   That's what he's saying.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.020]   "If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.560]   says to them, 'Go in peace, be warmed and filled,' without giving them the things needed
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.620]   for the body, what good is that?"
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.060]   So also faith by itself, it does not have works, is dead.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.980]   So the deeds that he's talking about, he said faith without deeds is dead.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:18.820]   The deed he's referring to is what Paul is talking about here, contributing to the needs
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.380]   of the saints.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.580]   When you're not generous, when you're not sharing, what good is it if you say, "Oh,
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.300]   I feel for you, go your own way."
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   Could that faith be genuine?
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.960]   Can somebody who has won the spiritual lottery be so stingy?
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.700]   Could that be real faith?
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.620]   Can somebody who has been targeted by the love of God to have eternity in heaven for
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:53.420]   him, a co-heir of Christ, who confesses to believe this, be so concerned only about himself?
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.240]   Could that faith be genuine?
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.660]   That's what he was referring to.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.220]   And the specific deed he's referring to is generosity.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:07.820]   James 1.27, "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this, to visit
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.300]   orphans and the widows in their affliction."
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.660]   That's true religion.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.660]   That's true faith.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:21.060]   That's basically, again, that's what James is writing.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:27.300]   So in this application, there are three things that we need to remember in priority.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:34.340]   First of all, the priority of generosity is you need to be responsible for your home first.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.220]   First is at home.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.780]   First Timothy 5.8 says, "But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.700]   for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:50.380]   This comes in the context of Paul saying to Timothy that you have these certain widows
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.780]   who are in need, but first of all, before the church gets involved, let the family take
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   care of them.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:03.060]   Because if a family member sees their mother or father who is in need and ignores them,
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.100]   he's worse than an unbeliever.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.860]   So the first priority in being generous, he says, is to your own home.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.620]   But here's the problem.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.340]   I think most people, some people have a problem with that, but most people will automatically,
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.020]   I mean, they're family, so you have to be generous.
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.300]   But usually, we're generous with our families, and they said, "That's where it stops."
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.420]   I mean, I got to take care of my family.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.980]   I got to take care of my brother, my sister, my aunt, my uncle, my grandfather, my grandmother,
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.180]   you know, my six children.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.040]   I mean, there's no end.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.380]   So basically, usually that's where it stops.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.700]   I take care of my family, and I fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.700]   No.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.300]   He said that priority-wise, that's where it starts.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:47.140]   But secondly, in Galatians 6.10, second priority is practice love with brothers and sisters
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.500]   in Christ first.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.380]   Galatians 6.10, "So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, especially to
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.260]   those who are of the household of faith."
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.980]   And over and over again, the Bible says the priority is the church.
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:06.620]   The priority is the church, the people who are around us, or other Christians in other
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.980]   parts of the world.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:14.020]   Typically, for whatever the reason, when we think of social justice, we think of outside,
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.060]   non-Christians.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:22.060]   The priority is first, whoever's closest to us, and then second, to the brothers, to the
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.200]   brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:29.020]   And then third, he calls us to strangers.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.580]   The word he uses here in verse 13, he says the word "hospitality," "Contribute to the
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.460]   needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality."
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.100]   The word for hospitality is philosania.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:47.100]   You probably noticed the first part, right, philo, where we get the word philadelphia,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.360]   brotherly love.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.900]   But the second part is zania, right?
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.260]   And the word for zania basically means outsider or stranger, right?
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.860]   To show affection to strangers.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.540]   That's what hospitality is.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:05.880]   So having your family members visit your house, that's not the biblical understanding of hospitality.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.300]   Having your friends coming over for dinner on Friday night, right, that's not the biblical
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   understanding of hospitality.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.420]   And some of you guys are really good at that.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   We think hospitality is just having a lot of friends and opening up your house to have
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   the party.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.420]   Instead of having it at your house, let's have it at my house because I'm hospitable.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.980]   The biblical idea of hospitality is not inviting your friends to your house.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:34.820]   It's an active love toward the outsiders, strangers, people that you do not know.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:40.660]   And it is in the context of a culture where there wasn't, you know, going to an inn or
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.420]   a hotel was not an option for most places.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.260]   So when strangers would walk in and you don't show them hospitality, they would basically
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.020]   have to sleep out on the street, right?
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.140]   And that's, you know, when you talk to the pastors in India, you know, a long time ago
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.420]   when they first started preaching the gospel, they said that's exactly what happened.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.920]   They would go to these villages and preach the gospel and if people were hospitable,
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.920]   they would sleep there.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:09.540]   So this is a, the pastor Matthew, you know, he has, he had four kids, little kids.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.060]   And he would walk into villages and if they weren't hospitable, he was out on the street.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.140]   And I remember Pastor Sake, who was our main contact, he would tell me how much he hated
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.140]   it.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.760]   He said when he grew up, he said the last thing he wanted to do was be a pastor because
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.320]   he remembered what it was like sleeping out in the fields.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.420]   So when he's talking about hospitality, he's talking about in that context of strangers
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   coming in and taking care of them.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.760]   That's the word that is used here.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:44.120]   And the reason why this is so important is because nothing reflects the love of God.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:49.780]   Nothing reflects the love of God so accurately than this word hospitality.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.400]   Loving strangers, loving outsiders.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.560]   In fact, remember we're talking, we're studying the book of Leviticus, you look at the details
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.580]   and how God is so concerned for even the poor who couldn't pay.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:10.280]   And so he had bull offerings, the goat offering, the sheep, and then he says to the pigeons
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   or turtles, and even if you couldn't afford that, if you were so poor you couldn't even
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.660]   afford that, he says to bring a tenth of ephah, the flowers.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.920]   He made provisions so that nobody would be excluded.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.800]   I mean he cared for them so much.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.440]   But God's care and concern goes way beyond that.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.440]   The fact that he looked at a nation who was rebelling against him, the fact that he didn't
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.880]   destroy them, that in and of itself would be like, wow, that's so much restraint for
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.680]   him not to destroy them.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.320]   But in Leviticus 19.34 he says, "You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.920]   the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920]   land of Egypt.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.000]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.080]   If you really studied from his perspective, not from our sinner's perspective, we're selfish
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:09.280]   and everything that we value from our perspective, you study the Word of God from his perspective,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.260]   why does he care?
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:20.400]   Why does he care that some stranger is coming into town, that he has something to eat?
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.000]   Why does he care about this guy who's most likely a pagan, an idol worshiper, coming
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.360]   in and leave a corner just for him?
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:36.040]   Deuteronomy 10.18-19, he executes justice for the fatherless and the widows, and loves
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.600]   the sojourners, giving him food and clothing, loved the sojourners, therefore, for you were
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.320]   sojourning in the land of Egypt.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.160]   He said, "Don't forget, this is who you were.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.600]   You weren't deserving of mercy.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   You are a sojourner.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.880]   You are a foreigner.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.920]   So don't forget."
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.160]   Isaiah 58.6-7, "Is it not this, that the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of the wickedness,
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.640]   to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.040]   Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.400]   when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?"
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:21.200]   The reason why he calls us to biblical love, to share, and to pursue, do you notice that?
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.720]   He didn't just say, "Practice it."
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.880]   He said, "To pursue hospitality.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.920]   Actively pursue the strangers who you wouldn't normally run into."
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.360]   You don't have to pursue your family.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.480]   You don't have to pursue your brothers and sisters, but you have to pursue the strangers,
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.520]   because strangers aren't here.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.320]   We could live the rest of our lives not practicing hospitality, just having friends over to our
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:53.640]   house and thinking we're practicing hospitality, but to actually practice hospitality, you
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.880]   have to be deliberately pursuing the lost.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.440]   You have to be deliberately pursuing people who can't pay you back, people who are not
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.680]   in your vicinity.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.880]   That's why he calls us to actively pursue, and the reason why he challenges us to pursue
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:20.160]   actively is because that's the core of the gospel message.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.360]   We didn't stumble upon God.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.400]   God wasn't just looking around and saying, "Well, I'm going to choose these people."
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.400]   The Bible says that he had us in his mind before the creation of the world.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:37.720]   Ephesians 1, 3-13, repeatedly, over and over again, he says, "He predestined us.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   He purposed."
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.680]   And he says over and over again, "He chose us.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.600]   He predestined us.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:49.120]   He purposed according to his mind, according to his purpose," over and over and over again
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.840]   to remind us that it didn't just happen.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.840]   It wasn't by accident.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:03.600]   A sovereign God planned to pursue sinners, sojourners who are hostile against him.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.400]   And so when he calls a church to practice hospitality, he's telling us to practice what
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.880]   he did with us.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:17.760]   If we want to be an aroma of Christ and we ignore this command, we ignore the very essence
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.360]   of how you got saved.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.800]   Remember, Jesus gives a parable of a man who's been forgiven, like millions and millions
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.960]   of dollars, and he refuses to forgive a man who owes him a few hundred bucks.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.080]   Remember what happens?
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.320]   You wicked servant.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.040]   You wicked servant.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:41.120]   Considering how much you've been forgiven and you refuse to forgive him, is it the very
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:48.680]   nature of who we are requires us to be generous if we really believe what it is that we have?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:57.560]   If Jesus is not something or someone that we use so that we can have a better life.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.800]   If Jesus is being used because I want a better job, because I want to have peace, I want
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.320]   to have security and not go to hell and go to heaven, if that's who Jesus is, then it
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.520]   would make sense that we wouldn't be generous, that we would be hoarders.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.640]   There's a whole purpose of why Jesus is here so that we can hoard more.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:24.880]   But if that's not the case, if the Jesus that we profess to believe and sing about, that
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:32.120]   he forsook everything so that he can make us co-heirs with Christ, he abandoned everything
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.600]   so that you and I could have everything, if that's the Jesus that we profess to believe
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:43.440]   and that's the Jesus that we follow, it automatically, we assume that that's the nature that we would
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.640]   take on ourselves.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.840]   That we would not be short-sighted.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.160]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.440]   Hebrews chapter 13, "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   have entertained angels unaware."
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:06.840]   Again, there's always a debate between who wrote the book of Hebrews, I personally think
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:12.600]   it's Paul, but again, I could be wrong, you're right.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.840]   But whoever wrote it, I think was very aware of the parable that Jesus was giving in Matthew
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.680]   chapter 25, 31 to 46.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.920]   He gives a parable how at the end, the goat and the sheep are going to be separated, and
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.600]   the way that they're going to be separated is, he says, "For I was hungry and you gave
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.680]   me food," verse 35, chapter 25, verse 35.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.400]   "I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.120]   and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me."
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.800]   Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.640]   thirsty and give you drink?
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.960]   When did we see you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and clothed you?
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.200]   And when did we see you sick and in prison or visit you?"
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.680]   And the king will answer them, "Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.400]   of my brothers, you did it to me."
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.840]   Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed into the eternal fire,
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.960]   prepared for the devil and his angels.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.920]   For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.560]   was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.540]   in prison and you did not visit me."
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:22.200]   Then they also answered, saying, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or strangers
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.660]   or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?"
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.720]   Then he will answer them, saying, "Truly I say to you, as you did not do it to one
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.040]   of the least of these, you did not do it to me.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:41.220]   And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:48.000]   Our greatest act of worship, tangibly, is to love people.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.360]   And the most tangible way that we can love people is by being hospitable, by being generous,
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:00.280]   by meeting the needs, recognizing what it is that we have in Christ, to actively, deliberately
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.200]   pursue those who are in need.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.000]   That's biblical love.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:16.920]   Would you take a minute again as we ask the worship team to come up?
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:22.240]   Let's take some time to pray and again, examine our own hearts.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.560]   Are we practicing this hospitality?
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:32.640]   Are we practicing this fellowship that the Bible describes?
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.960]   Are we living me-centered lives or is it truly Christ-centered?
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:42.920]   Again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray in response to God's
