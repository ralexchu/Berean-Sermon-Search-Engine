[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.520]   - All righty, good morning, church family.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.440]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.400]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.320]   In Psalm 92, it reads,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.400]   it is good to give thanks to the Lord
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.640]   to declare your loving kindness in the morning
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.240]   and your faithfulness by night.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.200]   With a 10-stringed lute and with the harp,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.240]   with resounding music upon the lyre.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.040]   For you, O Lord, have made me glad by what you have done,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.360]   and I will sing for joy at the works of your hands.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.200]   Amen.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.320]   (soft piano music)
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.800]   We're gonna begin our worship by singing a song.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.200]   It is good to praise the Lord.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.120]   (soft piano music)

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.880]   Welcome to Brain Community Church.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.920]   And I'm sure as some of you guys may have already noticed
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.800]   as you're coming in to find parking,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   the Ortho parking lot that's on the corner
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   of Mitchell and Red Hill,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.240]   it's one of the bigger ones
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.180]   that we've been using for a while.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.240]   The church, the building was sold
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.520]   and they have new owners in there.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.040]   And so we need to figure out a way to renegotiate
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   the exchange that we have between them and us.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.960]   And for the time being,
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.040]   that parking lot is shut down until further notice.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.920]   So when you come in,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.320]   we encourage you to use all the other lots.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.520]   If you are a family with small children,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.000]   again, the lot behind us is reserved for you.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.400]   So it may be a little bit tricky
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.800]   to go find it for the first time,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.880]   but there is plenty of parking there
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.160]   that a lot of the parents have not utilized yet.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.400]   And so if you're looking for parking
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.280]   and you have small children,
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.080]   that's the first place we want you to park.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.800]   And then obviously across the street,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.920]   and we have plenty of parking.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.720]   If you drive around, you'll see.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.800]   Especially if you're gonna park
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.920]   and then get shuttled here,
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.840]   we have more than enough parking for that.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.040]   But again, for the time being,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.840]   the ortho parking lot, again,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.480]   at the corner of Mitchell,
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.200]   at the end of the street and Red Hill,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.680]   that will be shut down for the time being.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.960]   We are trying to communicate with them,
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.160]   but we don't know if that's gonna open up again.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.120]   So just to give you a heads up on that.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.080]   Baby seating.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.680]   There's a new ministry that's starting,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.720]   and the name of it is Baby Seating.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.440]   So this is a new name that I forgot who came up with,
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.520]   but very clever.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.280]   So it's Baby Sitting, but it's Baby Seating.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.520]   So those of you who have children,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.040]   one year to 17 months,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.720]   before you send them to the Seeds Ministry
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.160]   for babysitting and program that they have there,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.040]   but in order for us to have space
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.520]   and so that the program that they're running
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.680]   for that service,
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.920]   they're gonna target some of the older kids
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.360]   who are able to participate.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   So Baby Seating Ministry is gonna be happening
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.640]   starting from March 3rd.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.440]   Okay, sorry, is it March 3rd?
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.320]   Yeah, March 3rd.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.240]   So not this Sunday, but the Sunday after.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.720]   And it's relevant only to this service, okay?
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.080]   And so if you have children that age,
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.280]   between one and 17 months,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.960]   you drop off the kids over there,
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.040]   and there'll be, volunteers will be babysitting.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   They've already carpeted the floor so it's cushiony,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.840]   so it's not on solid ground.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.240]   And so they're gonna be decorating
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   and getting that room ready.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840]   So it's not this, it's coming Sunday,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   but Sunday afterwards, that ministry will be open, okay?
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.720]   Then obviously after 17 months,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   they'll be coming to the Seeds Ministry after that.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.760]   Old Testament Survey, as I have already mentioned,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.920]   on March 3rd, for six weeks,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.360]   Pastor Peter Chung is going to be leading our church
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   in the study of the Old Testament Survey.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.000]   And if you haven't taken that class,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.320]   or you need a refresher on the general outline
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.280]   of how the Old Testament is put together,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.760]   and how it relates to the New Testament,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   that's a class I strongly recommend you to take.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.440]   And so please sign up for that,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.480]   and that's starting on March 3rd.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.680]   Again, on March 9th, 9 a.m.,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.160]   we have an All-Church Cleaning Maintenance Day.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.720]   So the more people sign up, the quicker it'll go,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.000]   and the more we're able to clean the church.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.480]   And I know that, you know, we've had a lot of questions,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.600]   like at a church our size,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.280]   wouldn't it be better if we just hired janitors to do that?
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.600]   But I think there is a benefit.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.040]   It's not because of finances,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   but there is a benefit for the church
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.900]   to take ownership of the church that we're attending,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.720]   that even though our church is a certain size,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.280]   it would be beneficial to have,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.620]   I think it's beneficial for our church members
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.160]   to take ownership of the building that we're using.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.680]   And so if you're able to come out,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.360]   we highly encourage you to come and help us clean.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.000]   That's happening on March 9th, Saturday at 9 a.m.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.520]   And then one last announcement.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.480]   If you are part of the FAM 245,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.400]   and this is a ministry for young couples
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.640]   who've been married for three years or less,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.300]   there is a Men's Hiking Fellowship
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.160]   that's taking place on March 9th, from 7.30 to 1 p.m.,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.960]   and they're gonna be reviewing
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.360]   the Divine Design for Marriage from MacArthur,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.560]   John MacArthur, and then the fellowship
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.120]   is gonna center around that topic,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.280]   and they're gonna be going hiking, having fellowship.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.080]   And so if you're a part of that ministry,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.160]   please sign up for that with our brother, Jason Choi.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.000]   All the other announcements,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.340]   I'm just gonna refer you to our website and to our app.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.600]   But let me pray for us for the offering.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.820]   Again, if you haven't transitioned to Subsplash,
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.240]   we wanna encourage you to do that.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.480]   We're gonna keep the Zelle open for just a little bit longer,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.940]   maybe about a month longer,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.560]   to give you more time to transition.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.800]   And if you choose not to,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.440]   you can always bring a physical offering
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.880]   that you can bring in the back.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.920]   But again, it will only be open for a little bit longer
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.860]   to give you a little bit more time to transition.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.960]   But let me pray for us and give you an opportunity to give,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.620]   and then we'll enter into the main worship.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.460]   Let's pray.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:08.440]   Father, we've gathered here together
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760]   to corporately worship you, Lord God,
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.320]   with our brothers and sisters.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.560]   Help us to give you what is sincere in our hearts,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.920]   not simply our time, not simply out of obligation.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.200]   I pray, Father, that you would fill our hearts
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.680]   with joy and gratitude,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.080]   that what we give you will be an overflow
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.240]   of the worship that you're creating inside of us.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.200]   Help us to lift up our eyes
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.440]   to know where our true help comes from.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.280]   Help us to be committed to the cause
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.000]   that you're committed to,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.160]   that even in our giving,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.640]   it would be in reflection of our dedication to you.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.200]   May your name be honored and glorified
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.040]   through this time.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.520]   and we will continue our worship.

[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   to Luke chapter seven,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   and we will be reading from verse 18 to 23.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   For the next about three weeks,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.480]   the message is going to center around John the Baptist,
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   and so this is gonna be the first part of it.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   They're not necessarily directly related,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.480]   but we're gonna be on the subject of John the Baptist
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   for the next few weeks.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   Luke chapter seven, verse 18 to 23,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   reading out of the NASB,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   "The disciples of John reported to him
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   "about all these things, summoning two of his disciples.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   "John sent them to the Lord, saying,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   "'Are you the expected one,
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   "'or do we look for someone else?'
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   "When the men came to him, they said to John the Baptist,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   "'Has sent us to you to ask, are you the expected one,
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   "'or do we look for someone else?'
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   "At that very time, he cured many people of diseases
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.480]   "and afflictions and evil spirits,
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   "and he gave sight to many who were blind.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   "And he answered and said to them,
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   "'Go and report to John what you have seen,'
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   "and her, the blind, received sight, the lame walked,
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   "the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   "The dead are raised up,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   "the poor have the gospel preached to them.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.480]   "Blessed is he who does not take offense at me."
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   Let's pray.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   Lord, we pray for wisdom.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.480]   We pray for insight.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   We pray for the Holy Spirit to guide and lead us,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   convict us,
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   that we may do more than just listen and to learn,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   but that we may live lives, Lord God,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.480]   truly worthy of the calling that you've given.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   We love you, Lord.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   We desire to worship you.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   Let me ask you a question that I want you to think about
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   just for a few seconds.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   How sure are you about your faith?
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.480]   How convicted are you that what we sing,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   what we study is true?
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.480]   That heaven and hell is real?
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.480]   That the Son of God came and walked on this earth
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   and he gave his life so that you and I, sinners, can be saved?
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   How assured are you of this truth?
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   For whatever the reason,
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   the beginning of our faith begins by confessing we believe that.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   We repent, we receive Christ,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.480]   but for whatever the reason, after we become Christian,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   we don't ask, we don't seek.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   And so we go through various periods of our life
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   where we come to a crisis of faith,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   but we don't seek, we don't ask.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   And so as a result of that, sometimes we remain in our doubt,
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   and that doubt causes us to remain distant from God.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.480]   Some people have certain crises.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   Maybe you've had somebody that you dearly loved,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.480]   and they passed away, and you cried out to God,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   and God didn't answer.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   So why didn't he answer?
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   Or certain things that are happening in your life,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   you thought it was going to be a one-way,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   but it didn't happen that way,
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   and so you start having a crisis of faith.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   It's like, is this real?
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   I know that the congregation can wrestle with that,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   because I know many pastors who wrestle with that.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   Is this all real?
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   Is this just something that I'm wishful thinking?
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   As some people may face crisis,
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.480]   and they get to that point and they never move beyond that,
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   most people have a crisis of faith simply out of neglect.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   They began with a bang.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   It's like, I met Christ, and initially I didn't go to church,
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   and now I go to church.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   But outside of going to church
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   and have made the church your community,
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   the passionate pursuit of Christ no longer exists in your life.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   You just learn to play the church game.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   And so you have lingering doubts,
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   and many people simply out of neglect.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   They didn't pursue it, they didn't seek it, they didn't ask.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   Now, everyone at some point in their walk with God
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.480]   will have some sort of crisis of faith.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   But every once in a while, we run into somebody
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   where we are surprised, maybe even shocked,
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   that they struggled with this.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   In the last few years, we've run into some people,
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   without mentioning any specific names,
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   I think many of us would know,
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   that people who have lived and did ministry
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   and bore so much fruit, and then after they die,
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   found out that their faith didn't match
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   what they were presenting up in the public.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   That their private life, they were completely different people.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   And maybe most people, their difference may not be as drastic.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   But we wonder, how can somebody
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   who seemed to have everything together,
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   who seemed to be used by God so powerfully,
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   be so bankrupt in his faith?
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   Today, we're going to be dealing with John the Baptist.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   John the Baptist.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   In Luke chapter 7, 18-20,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   it says the disciples of John reported to him
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   about all these things.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.480]   asking, "Are you the expected one,
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.480]   or do we look for someone else?"
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   When the men came to him, they said,
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   "John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask,
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   are you the expected one, or do we look for someone else?"
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   It says, Luke's recording has two separate, same statement,
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   "Are you the expected one? Are you the one?
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   Are you the Messiah?"
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   Again, any time you see something repeated,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   you know that it's for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   The fact that Luke records the same question twice
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   means the significance of what he is asking.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   But the fact that he asks this question,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   many people ask this question.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   Many people during that time asked the question.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   Many people today will ask the same question.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   Can this be true?
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   Is this real? Is Jesus really the Son of God?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   But the reason why we're perplexed is because it's John.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   How could John ask this question?
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   John is the last prophet of the Old Covenant.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   In fact, in the next text, we're going to see that Jesus says,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   "Of all the people who were born of a woman,
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   John is the greatest."
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   He is the greatest of all the prophets.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   Think about that. Elijah, Elisha, Jonah,
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   all the prophets that we know, Daniel.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   He said, "Of all the prophets,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   John's the greatest of all the prophets."
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   John was the one who, from the very get-go,
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.480]   God had personally ordained.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   He's going to be the one who's going to go
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   and prepare the way for my Son to come.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   Even before he was born.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   In fact, in Luke chapter 144,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   when the two mothers, Mary and Elizabeth,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   they get together with the children in their womb,
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   it says that John the Baptist leaped
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   because he recognized the Savior in Mary's womb.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   Even before he ever set eyes on Jesus,
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   he recognized Him.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   It's that John that's asking this question.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   "Are you the one?"
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   He's the one, when Jesus showed up on the scene
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   and told everybody,
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   "That's the one we've been preparing for
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   that's greater than none.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   My whole life was dedicated for His coming."
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   And so he diverted all the attention to Christ.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   When Jesus came to get baptized,
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   He said, "How can you baptize me?
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   You are so much greater than that.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   The whole reason why I exist is to prepare for you."
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   Jesus says, "It is good to do this now
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   So John reluctantly baptized Jesus,
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   and then when he comes out of the water,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   he hears the audible voice of God that says,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   "This is my beloved Son, who I am well pleased."
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   John saw all this. He heard all of this.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   He's the one who dedicated his life for this purpose.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   And yet, it's that John who's asking,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   "Are you the one? Are you the one?"
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.480]   Why is John asking this question?
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   Just to kind of give you a background
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   behind what was happening,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   John has become extremely popular.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   So many people were leaving everything
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   and they were coming to follow Jesus
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   because they clearly understood he was a prophet from God
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   and he was speaking the truth.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   And even though he lived a difficult life,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   by the time Christ shows up, he was the superstar.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   He was the main guy.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   He was the closest thing that they've heard of a prophet
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   in hundreds of years.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.480]   And so John, the Baptist disciples,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   see that Jesus' ministry is starting to flourish
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   and all the disciples who were coming to John
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   were starting to transition to Jesus,
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.480]   and it looked like it bothered some of them.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   And so in John chapter 3, 26,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   "And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   he who was with you beyond the Jordan
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   to whom you have testified,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.480]   behold, he is baptizing and all are coming to him.'"
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   So there's some coveting that's going on.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   Why are we losing all our disciples
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.480]   that you've worked so hard to garner?
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   They're all going to him.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   John, I don't have the text for you for the sake of time,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   but John basically corrects them in saying,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   "I am not the bride.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.480]   I told you that I came to prepare the way for the bride,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.480]   that they should be going,
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.480]   and I've been preparing you for this,
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   that when he comes that you ought to follow him."
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   And he ends that passage in John 3, 30 by saying,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.480]   "He must increase, but I must decrease."
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   All this is from John.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.480]   John's the one who told us who he is.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   John's the one who identified.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   John's the one who prepared and sacrificed
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.480]   for the coming of Christ.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   And yet he's sitting and asking the disciples.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   And you go ask him, "Are you the one?"
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   It tells us in Matthew 11,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   the parallel passage to the text that we're looking at,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   it doesn't tell us here,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   but in that text it tells us that John is sitting in prison.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   Most commentators believe that John has been in prison
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   for at least a year, possibly up to two years.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   And so during the two years that he's sitting in prison,
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   just waiting for his execution,
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   because he ended up calling out King Agrippa
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   for marrying his brother's wife.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   So that angered somebody who was in great power
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   and put him in jail.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   And then eventually, as you guys know,
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   he ends up getting beheaded for him calling out
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   the sin of the king.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   During the two years that he's sitting in prison,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   it seems like his faith started to get questioned.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   Because what he was experiencing
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   and what he dedicated his life to, it just didn't fit.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   His idea of the Messiah didn't fit what he was seeing.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   In fact, in Matthew 3, 10 through 12,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   John the Baptist, introducing Christ,
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   describes what Jesus' ministry was going to be like.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   He says, "The ax is already laid at the root of the trees.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   "Therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   "is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   "As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance,
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   "but he who is coming after me is mightier than I,
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   "and I am not fit to remove his sandals.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   "He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   He says, "I am preaching to you,
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   "repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   But because he's just a mere man,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   all he can do is lead them into baptism,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   a physical ceremony.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   But he said, "The one who's coming, when Jesus comes,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   "he's going to baptize you
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   "with the power of the Holy Spirit and fire."
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   And fire, in the Old Testament and in the New Testament,
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.480]   is referred to as judgment.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   It's a cleansing agent.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   And so when he comes,
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   he's not simply going to take you through a ceremony.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   Real judgment, real cleansing is going to happen
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   because of the sins of Israel,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   because of the oppression of the enemies.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.480]   Real power is coming, and he will make things right.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   In verse 12, it says, "His winnowing fork is in his hand,
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   "and he will thoroughly clear his threshing floor,
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   "and he will gather his wheat into the barn,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   "but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   This is how he understood the Messiah's ministry.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.480]   He said, "When Jesus comes, he's going to bring this fire."
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   But after he says this, he spends two years in prison,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   and it didn't make sense.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   Why would a man who was handpicked by God himself
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   to prepare the way of the coming of Christ,
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:25.480]   and as soon as Jesus appears, his life is over?
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   Not only did the judgment not come,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   not only did the judgment and the fire
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.480]   and the separating of the wheat and the chaff did not happen,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   because they're still sitting in power,
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   that power put him in jail,
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   and that power is about to behead him.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   And so John the Baptist sitting in prison
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   is asking an honest question.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   Are you the one?
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   Because what's happening, what he's seeing,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   just doesn't fit what he thought.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   In fact, we know that this was not just a problem
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   with John the Baptist.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   We know that all the Pharisees
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   and the people who were crying out, "Hosanna, Hosanna,"
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   turned against him because he didn't come to conquer.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   His idea of conquering was giving up his life,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.480]   and even the disciples, even though Jesus made it very clear
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   he's going to go to the cross, he's going to be beaten,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.480]   and then put to death and be resurrected,
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   they didn't understand because what they understood
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   to be the Messiah didn't fit what Jesus was doing.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   So they also had a crisis of faith.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   This is a common experience of most people,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   where we imagine what our life is going to be like,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   and when life doesn't turn out exactly the way
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.480]   that we thought it was going to work out,
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.480]   that if I followed Christ, if I'm faithful,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   that God will provide this and that,
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.480]   and this will happen, and that you will bear so much fruit.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   And when things just don't fit,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   our honest crisis of faith is, "Where are you?
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.480]   "Why aren't you answering my prayer?
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   "Why did it turn out this way?
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   "Why did these things happen?"
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   In fact, if you read Psalms,
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.480]   so much of the Psalms is a godly man
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   complaining before God or questioning.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   "Where are you?"
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   Typically, when we read Psalms,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   you kind of pick and choose the favorites,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   and so you don't really get to see
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   the whole experience of Psalms.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   But one of the beauty of the Bible,
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   and in particular, Psalm,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.480]   is that it's just an honest expression.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.480]   So it doesn't hide.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   It doesn't just say, "Oh, God is so good.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.480]   "He's so wonderful.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.480]   "He's worthy of praise."
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   Again, Psalm is filled with that,
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   but it's also filled with grumbling
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.480]   and complaining before God.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   "Where are you?"
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   In Psalms chapter 13, one and two,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   David, a man who was handpicked
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   as the king of Israel,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   considered even to this day
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   the greatest king of Israel,
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   man after God's own heart,
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   he says, "How long, O Lord,
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   "will you forget me forever?
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   "How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   "How long shall I take counsel in my soul?
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   "Having sorrow in my heart all day long,
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   "how long will my enemy be exalted over me?"
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   Even though this is a man after God's own heart,
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   what he was experiencing just did not fit.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   And so we have Psalm after Psalm,
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   this man of God coming before God,
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   "Why are you allowing the wicked to prosper?
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   "And I've sacrificed so much to honor you,
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   "and why are the enemies still after me?
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   "Where are you?
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   "How long are you going to let this happen?"
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   Psalm 10, one through five,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   "Why do you stand afar off, O Lord?
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.480]   "Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   "In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   "Let them be caught in their places
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   "which they have devised.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   "For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   "and the greedy man curses and spurns the Lord.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   "The wicked, in haughtiness of his countenance,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   "does not seek him.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   "All his thoughts are, 'There's no God.'
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.480]   "His ways prosper at all times.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   "Your judgments are on high out of his sight,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   "as for all of his adversary, he snorts at them."
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   He says, "I've lived my life righteously to follow you,
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   "and here's these wicked people
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   "who are basically blaspheming your name.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   "I don't even believe you."
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   And they said, "There's no judgment coming upon me."
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   And yet they continue to prosper.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   Why do you do this, God?
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   There are things that happen in our life.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   If you live long enough,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   multiple times you may have asked the question,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   "Why didn't God answer that prayer?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   "Why did he allow this to happen?"
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   And we get to that crisis of faith,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   and when we get to that crisis of faith,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   many of us just linger.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   Just linger.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   And we allow that doubt and that crisis to linger,
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   just to affect the way you live your life.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   You'll come to church.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   You'll give.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   You'll serve a little.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   But when Christ says to pick up your cross and follow me,
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   that I cannot do because I'm not sure.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   And we are okay with not being sure.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   See, John wasn't simply doubting.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   John was asking a question.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   And there is a huge difference between questioning
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   and asking questions.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.480]   Questioning is somebody who's already come to a conclusion,
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   and they're presenting to you their concerns
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   or their opinions in the form of a question,
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.480]   but they're not asking you any questions.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.480]   They're questioning.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   "Why does your God do this?
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.480]   "Why is God like that?
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.480]   "Why is he this way?"
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   And he's already come to the conclusion.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   Someone who is asking questions
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   simply has a crisis of faith in asking,
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   "God, what is happening?"
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   Maybe there's things that you don't understand.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   Maybe you had an idea of God that was wrong.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   Maybe your perception, your goals, your dreams
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   were all founded upon something that God desires to destroy.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   And God leads you to this place of crisis
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   so that you would seek him.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   In fact, the Bible says, "Seek, ask, and knock,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   "and he will answer.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   "You'll open the door, and he will be found."
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   He wants us to seek.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   He wants us to ask.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   John wasn't simply questioning God.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   He had to confirm his faith.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   He had to confirm his faith because, one,
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   it didn't fit what he thought,
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   but, two, he's about to give his life.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   So he's asking, "Is this true?"
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   Somebody who's never sacrificed anything to follow Christ
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   can remain in the crisis of his faith the rest of his life
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   because you lose nothing.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.480]   A nominal Christian neither wants to be shaken in his faith
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   and then have to walk away from his faith,
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   nor does he want to be challenged and be convicted
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   because either his faith gets shaken
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   or either his faith gets challenged,
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   it will force him to move beyond his mediocre life.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   It will force him to sacrifice what is important to him,
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   and what is important to that person
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   is the Christian life that he has created for himself
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   that cannot be shaken.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   So if he pursues the question of his faith
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.480]   and the conclusion that he comes up with is,
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.480]   "I'm not sure if I believe this,"
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   and as a result of that, you may have to leave the church.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.480]   I mean, I can't keep coming to church if I don't believe this.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   You're going to lose all the friends that you've created.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.480]   What about your parents?
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.480]   What about the community that you've built?
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.480]   What about the expectation?
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   I mean, you became a Sunday school teacher
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   or even a pastor or an elder in the church.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   Everything that I built up has to be sacrificed.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   If I pursue this and I come to the conclusion
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   that maybe I don't believe this,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.480]   and so as a result of that,
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   they come to a crisis of faith and they remain
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   because they don't want to face the consequences,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   nor does that person pursue this
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.480]   because if they come to the conclusion
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   and they are convicted that this is true,
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   they also need to move beyond where they are,
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   that this nominal Christian life,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   this cultural Christianity that they've embraced
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   is not enough,
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   that you've never truly surrendered your life to Christ,
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.480]   that you've admired Him from a distance.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   You sang about Him, but you never followed Him.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   You never gave your life to Christ,
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   and so you've pursued your life in mediocre Christian life,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   pursuing your own pleasure, pursuing your own life,
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   but when the Scripture says that this life
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.480]   no longer belongs to you, what is your career?
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   It no longer matters.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   What is your reputation?
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   It no longer matters because you have been crucified with Christ.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   The Bible says that you have been purchased
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   by the blood of Christ and you now belong to Him.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   God didn't die for you and then said,
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   "Now go live the way you desire."
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   He says, "No, your life is mine."
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   Your life will come when Christ comes in His glory,
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.480]   and when Jesus said, "He who wants to come after me
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   must deny himself and pick up his cross, follow me,"
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   if you are convicted by this truth,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   you are forced to face that reality.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.480]   Am I following Christ?
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   I've heard people say that if you reject Christ,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   the consequence of that is that
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   if heaven and hell is real, you'll go to hell.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   And I've heard people say, "But if I'm wrong,
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   I've lost nothing because I have family, friends,
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.480]   and I have purpose, and I have the Bible,
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   and I have community.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   But if I'm right, I get to go to heaven.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   If I'm wrong, I've lost nothing."
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   That sounds like wisdom initially,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   but there's nothing further from what we see in Scripture.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15, 17, 19, it says,
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   "And if Christ has not been raised,
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   your faith is worthless.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   You are still in your sins.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   If we have hoped in Christ, in this life only,
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   we are all men most to be pitied."
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   If this is not real, we are to be pitied.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   And the reason why we are to be pitied
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   is because Christ requires our life.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   He didn't simply say, "If you don't have a community,
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   if you feel lonely, if you need purpose,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   you want to be a righteous person rather than unrighteous,
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   you want a place where your children are going to be
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   raised with good morals."
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   No, he said, "Pick up your cross.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   Your career no longer matters.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   Your bank account no longer matters to God.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   It no longer matters."
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   Because our whole life is to be dedicated to follow Jesus,
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   and he went to the cross, and he told us all,
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   "If you believe me, follow me."
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   See, John wasn't simply tickling his ears.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   He needed confirmation because he's about to give his life.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   Are you the one?
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   Those who have never surrendered their life to Christ
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   can live with doubts.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   Can live in mediocrity because you already have
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   what you desire in Christ.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   You have everything that you have desired in Christ already.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   So you don't want your faith to be bothered
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   and force you to make a decision out of the church,
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   nor do you want to be bothered to force you to question,
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   "Are you really surrendered to Christ?"
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   So we oftentimes embrace the crisis and stay there
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   because of the consequence one way or the other.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   The person who has sacrificed the most
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   has to be convicted the most.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   The person who is picking up his cross needs to know for sure
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   that when Jesus says that there's life on the other side of this cross,
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   that this is true.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   You can admire him.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   You can be a fanboy of Jesus,
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   but you cannot follow Christ
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.480]   if you're not convicted that this is true.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   The way that Jesus even answers this question,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   he answers them, he says, "Go and report to John
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   what you have seen and heard.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   Blind receive sight, lame walk, the lepers are cleansed,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   The poor have the gospel preached to them."
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   Now this is nothing new.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   In fact, in Matthew 11, 2-3,
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   it tells us that he was already hearing this,
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   and he's sitting in prison.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   Can you confirm?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   Can you confirm if this is true?
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   And Jesus, all he does is confirm to John
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   what you have heard your disciples have seen.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   Go tell him that the true evidence of the one is in me.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   You see, people who've endured in their faith
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   are not people who understood.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   I understand God. I understand why he's doing it.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   I understand what he's doing now in our culture. I understand.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   It's not because they understood.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   It's because they believed.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   Even the disciples, when Jesus began to say,
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   "If you don't drink of my blood and eat of my flesh,
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   there's no relationship with you,"
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   they didn't understand.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   But Jesus turned to them and said, "Are you going to go too?"
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   And he said, "Where am I going to go?
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   We believe you are the Son of God, and you have the words of life.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   Where else are we going to go?"
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   It's not because they understood.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   It's because they believed.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   They believed.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   There are things that often happen in our lives
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   that we can't make sense of.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   Why did God do that?
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   Why is he allowing him to do that?
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   Well, what causes us to persevere
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.480]   is a conviction that this is true,
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   that he is the Son of God,
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   that this is the Word of God.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   Even if I don't understand what he is doing,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   even if I don't understand where he is leading me to,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.480]   I believe him.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   That's exactly what the Scripture tells us,
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   that Jesus left this evidence.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   In John 3, 2, when Nicodemus comes to him at night,
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   this man came to Jesus by night and said to him,
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.480]   They recognized these signs, and Nicodemus says,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   "Clearly, you must be the one."
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   John 7, 31, many of the crowds believed in him,
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   and they were saying, "When the Christ comes,
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   he will not perform more signs than those which this man has.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   Will he?"
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   So they believed because of the many miracles,
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   because they knew it was a clear sign that he's the one.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   And then in John 15, 24, it says,
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   "If I had not done among them the works which no one else did,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   they would not have sinned.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   But now they have both seen and hated me and my father as well."
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   In other words, they do not reject me
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   because I have not given them enough evidence.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   Plenty of evidence has been given to them,
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   but yet they chose to reject me.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   So therefore, they are guilty.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   We may look at that and say, you know,
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   we're 2,000 years removed from these miracles.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   So if Jesus said, "I'm going to leave you these miracles
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   as a clear sign of who he is," what about us?
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   When we come to crisis of faith, what do we do?
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   If Jesus' answer to the crisis of faith that John the Baptist had,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   and he says, "Look at all the miracles
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.480]   because it's a clear sign of who I am,"
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   well, if you're asking that question, good,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.480]   because people of that generation asked the same question.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   Even though they had front-row seats of his miracles,
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   they kept on asking him, "We need signs, we need signs."
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   Remember what Jesus said, this wicked and evil generation,
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   "I will give no sign except for the sign of Jonah,"
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   referring to his death and resurrection.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   I will leave that sign until I come.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   So if anybody doubts, anybody has crisis of faith,
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   you can look into that, and I will leave that as a proof
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   to everything that I have said.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   For 2,000 years, even though we're 2,000 years removed
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.480]   from these miracles that Jesus is referring to,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.480]   people have dissected, studied, questioned
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   the resurrection of Christ,
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   and even those who reject Jesus as God
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   will tell you that something spectacular
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   happened in the first century.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   The fact that the Jews and Gentiles got together,
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   the fact that this obscure small group of fishermen
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.480]   turned the world upside down in the first 100 years,
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   the fact that we have Scripture that's been copied
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   and recopied thousands of times,
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   more than any other historical document that we have,
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.480]   people have questioned the validity,
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   historical validity of the resurrection of Christ,
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   and so many have come to the conclusion
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   that this must have happened.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   I've had so many people throughout the years come to me
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   in crisis of faith, telling me
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   that they're not sure if they believe.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   And so I would ask them, "What is it that you have a hard time?"
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   "You know, these miracles and these things, I'm not sure if I believe."
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   And they're about to walk away from their faith,
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   and I would suggest to them to read this book,
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.480]   "Who Moved the Stone?"
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   There's so many things that you can read.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   And at the end of it, you can read that and say,
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   "I don't believe it," and walk away.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   But you don't know how many people that have come to me and asked me,
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   when I pointed them to the evidence,
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   that they wouldn't even take time to read that.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.480]   So were you really asking a question?
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   You've already come to a conclusion without even searching.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   You've already made the conclusion that Christ is not what you want.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   So even though the Bible says, and God said,
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   that He left enough evidence that anybody who is
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   searching and asking and knocking,
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.480]   He says He left evidence for you at least to come to the conclusion
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   that something spectacular must have happened.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   And the most logical, reasonable thing
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   is the conclusion that Jesus must have been resurrected from the dead.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   Yet so many people who will never search, ask, and knock
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   simply walk away from their faith and say,
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   "It doesn't make any sense."
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.480]   Well, how do you know it makes any sense?
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   How do you know if there's any evidence?
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   You've never researched. You've never searched.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.480]   And just as it says in Romans 1 that they suppress the truth
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.480]   because they love darkness more than the truth,
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   so many nominal Christians will come to a crisis of faith
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   and have doubts that they never share with anybody else.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   But you can see it in their life.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.480]   They doubt if this is real, but you can see by the decisions that they make.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   They doubt if God is going to take care of them
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.480]   because of the way that they make decisions about finances,
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   but they'll never share that.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   They'll live it.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   And they will never pursue because if you pursue this,
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   either you will conclude that you don't believe
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   and everything that you've built up is destroyed,
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   or you will come to the conclusion that this is absolutely true
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.480]   and it will destroy your nominal Christian life that you've built up.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   And you can no longer embrace cultural Christianity and be okay.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.480]   Neither option is acceptable to a nominal Christian.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   The question isn't, "Why did John ask?"
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   The real question is, "How come more people don't ask?"
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   It isn't that John asked to clarify because he's about to give his life.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   I need to be sure that this is the right path.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   But so many people come to that conclusion
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.480]   and they're perfectly okay with living with their doubts,
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   but they're unwilling to face the consequence of that question.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   Jesus ends this interaction in Luke 7:23 by saying,
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   "Blessed is he who does not take offense at me."
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   He's reconfirming for John that what is happening to you is ordained.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   You are hated because they've hated me, just like Jesus said.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   They will reject you because they rejected me.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   In fact, over and over again, this was the prophecy given to us clearly
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   in Luke 2.34-35, "And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   'Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel.'"
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   The fall and rise of many in Israel.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   He understood the rise of Israel, but he didn't understand the fall of Israel,
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:01.480]   which was prophesied from the get-go and for a sign to be what? Opposed.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.480]   When Jesus reveals the sign of who he is, he said many will oppose him.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   They will hate him. They will be offended by him.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   "And a sword will pierce even your own soul to the end
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed."
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.480]   When he is revealed, the opposition will be revealed.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   What's truly in their heart, he says, will be revealed.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.480]   And he will be the cause of the rise and fall of many in Israel.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   1 Peter 2.7-8, Peter says, "This precious value then is for you who believe,
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   but for those who disbelieve. The stone which the builders rejected
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.480]   became the very cornerstone and a stone of a stumbling and a rock of offense.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   For they stumble because they are disobedient to the word,
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   and to this doom they were also appointed."
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   That this cornerstone, which the church is built upon,
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   is an offense to those who do not recognize him.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   We live in a culture where we try to make Christianity
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   as palatable to as many people as possible.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:15.480]   And you know who hates true Christianity more than anybody else?
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   Fake Christians.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   If you read the book of Revelation carefully, the Antichrist figure is a religious figure
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   who is going to unite all religious people under his umbrella.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   And the people who oppose that are the ones who have embraced the true gospel
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   that is the cause of rise and fall of many.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   And so the greatest opposition is going to come within the church of nominal Christians
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   who does not desire to be represented to the world
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   by hateful speech of saying Christ is exclusive.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   There's only one way of salvation and his name is Jesus Christ.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.480]   And it is that message that they hate.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   And we have churches after churches, pastors after pastors,
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:13.480]   who are more afraid of the opinion of men than they are of the judgment of God.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   And as a result, we created a Christianity that doesn't look anything like what we see in the scripture.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:25.480]   Jesus is reaffirming to John the Baptist, "Blessed is he who does not take offense at me."
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   In fact, Paul describes his ministry in this way,
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:35.480]   "For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved, among those who are perishing.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   To the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.480]   Who is adequate for these things?
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but ask from sincerity, but ask from God.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.480]   We speak in Christ, in the sight of God."
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   The question is not, "Why did John ask this question?"
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   The question is, "Why are we not pursuing this?"
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:04.480]   Are you certain?
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   Is the gospel that you embrace worth giving your life for?
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   Be honest.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   Have you given your life to be a follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   Do you just admire him from a distance?
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   Do you give praise for other people that seem to be going hard?
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   But by the decisions we make, by the life that we choose, by the priorities that we have in life,
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   we have crises of faith that we're not dealing with.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   So the challenge this morning is not to figure out why John asked the question,
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   because we can clearly understand why John asked the question.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   Jesus said to pick up your cross, and he has his cross on his shoulder.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.480]   He said, "They hated me, so they're going to hate you," so he's experiencing this hate.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   He's about to end his life in ministry, proclaiming Christ, so he needed to know, "Are you the one?"
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:16.480]   How many of us have come to that point and just embraced nominal Christianity?
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   How many of us have chosen to embrace mediocrity and blamed our doubt for not giving all to Christ?
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.480]   This message of the cross requires us to come to a conclusion.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   Do you believe this?
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:41.480]   If you do, it is worth everything that you have.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.480]   Everything that you have.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   If it cuts your life short, if it ruins your business,
[00:59:51.480 --> 01:00:00.480]   if you get fired, if you can't get the job, and your life gets cut short,
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   it's worth everything that God has called us to sacrifice.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.480]   And that's why we need to be sure.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   That's why we need to be sure.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   Are you sure?
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   Are you sure that this is true?
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   So I want to conclude with the challenge.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   Not, "Why did John ask the question?"
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   Why aren't more people asking, seeking, and knocking?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   That we also may follow the path of Christ.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   Let's pray.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:53.480]   Father, you are worthy of our praise.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   More than simple lip service, but our very lives.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   Help us, Lord God, to confess and to believe and to practice
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.480]   that we have been crucified with Christ.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   It is no longer us that live, but Christ living in us.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   Help us, Lord God, that that may not be empty confession,
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   but it would be our very lives, Lord.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:31.480]   As John gave his life preparing for Christ's path,
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:36.480]   call us, Lord God, as you have planned to the church,
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   that the gates of Hades would not be able to prevail against it,
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   that we would not live our lives in mediocrity,
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   but that we would be a community fully convicted of this truth,
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   that wherever you lead us, that we would follow and glorify you.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.480]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
