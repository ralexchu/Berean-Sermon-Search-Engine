[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   >> A refreshment got something.
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.600]   Make sure you make your way back.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.380]   In terms of the questions, thank you for sending them in.
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.700]   Because of the sheer number, I'm going to be selecting
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.560]   from the text messages that came in.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.320]   So some people have asked, is there open mic?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560]   No open mic time.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.080]   I'm just going to be filtering through.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.860]   Again, for those of you guys who are in the back,
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.220]   start taking your seats, and in a minute, we'll begin.

[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.220]   >> There, that's better.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.220]   >> Okay, everybody.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.220]   We are gonna begin at this time, so if you're in the back, please take your seat now.
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.220]   And then let's all quiet down and settle in for our Q&A time.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.220]   We're gonna just go for one hour and cap it there, okay?
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.220]   So thank you, whoever was trying over there to get everybody's attention.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.220]   Shh, oh nice, very good.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.220]   Well, I wanna begin with just a couple quick announcements wise.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.220]   So I do have the winners of our free books, okay?
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.220]   Thanks to you for everybody who sent in a question.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.220]   We actually had tons of questions come in and I can't get to every single one.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.220]   But the first person to text me today was Tiffany Yu.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.220]   Now, I'm not gonna call you up here for the sake of time.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.220]   But because we surprisingly actually have now three Tiffany Yus who registered,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.220]   your phone number ends with 8248, okay?
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.220]   That's you, so congratulations on being the first winner.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.220]   Also, the winner of the Men Discipling Men one is our brother Patrick Choi.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.220]   So let's give him a round.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.220]   Thanks for sending in that question.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.220]   And the final winner of the third book is Huber Kim.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.220]   All right, just for the sake of time, we're not gonna have you guys come up.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.220]   But please see me after and we'll give those books to you.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   Also, we passed out to you this info literature about the Master's University program.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.220]   I wanted to give you an opportunity just to share with a little bit about the program.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.220]   >> Yeah, you received a little bit.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.220]   In fact, that's one of the reasons why Master's lets me go on the road once in a while,
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.220]   is to be able to kind of represent the program.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.220]   Now, you may not be interested in it, but maybe you know somebody that is.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.220]   So I'd recommend you save that and give it to them.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.220]   This is a fully accredited graduate program.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.220]   We've been in existence for 26 years.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.220]   So we have a long track history, a really good one.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   It goes way, way back.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.220]   Most of the people that teach in our program are all ACBC certified,
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.220]   and they're actively involved in their local churches as well.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.220]   And very, very well known, all of them are published authors in the Biblical Counseling Movement as well.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.220]   So if you're interested at all in the--it's a two-year program, graduate program,
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.220]   that consists of 34 graduate hours in the MABC, which is the Master of Arts in Biblical Counseling.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.220]   Just tell you a little quick story.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.220]   There was a woman who joined our program, and she told me the story.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.220]   She had two Master's degrees and a doctorate degree,
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.220]   and she was teaching at a major university, med students.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.220]   She was teaching psychology.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.220]   And she and her husband were having serious marital problems.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.220]   They went to their pastor for help, and he helped them so much.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   Here's all of her training in psychology, and they didn't get any help, none whatsoever.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.220]   And the pastor helped them, and she said to the pastor, "Well, where did you get this?"
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.220]   He says, "Well, I learned this out at the Master's University
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.220]   in the graduate teaching program out there in Biblical Counseling."
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.220]   And she said, "Well, do you suppose they let me in?"
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.220]   And so she applied, went, and graduated,
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.220]   and now she is actively involved now in Biblical Counseling
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.220]   and actually traveling around the world doing Biblical Counseling right now.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.220]   So it's really exciting.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.220]   She sent me an email after she graduated from the program saying how much she had learned.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:05.220]   She said basically her other three graduate degrees didn't teach her as much as she learned in our program,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   which is really, really significant when it comes to using the Word of God effectively in the lives of people.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   So if you're interested in doing that, sign up.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.220]   In fact, there's a sign-up sheet in the back table back there somewhere.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.220]   The table is where you did the registration.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.220]   After the Q&A, we're going to have some volunteers actually man that booth,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.220]   and they'll direct you to where you can sign up for that.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.220]   So just visit the table right out the exit on the left.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.220]   And we're really close to, in fact, probably this November, we'll get the final word for it.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.220]   It's taken seven years to get this point,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.220]   launching a doctoral program fully accredited in Biblical Counseling as well.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.220]   So that's where our next step is, and we're looking forward to it.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.220]   And, in fact, on that sign-up sheet, you can mark whether or not you're interested in the graduate program
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.220]   or the doctoral program, whichever one you would be interested in.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:04.220]   Our whole purpose here is to not--we don't want to train people to go out and hang up a shingle and do counseling.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.220]   We want them to go back underneath the authority of their local church
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.220]   and work under the authority of their leadership and their elders in their church to do counseling in that context.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.220]   That's what we're after, all right, those kind of people that are interested in doing that.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.220]   Amen.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.220]   I'll just say it would have been really nice if you guys set up that doctoral program.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.220]   Because I'm flying out to Kentucky right now.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.220]   It would have been nice if we could set that up.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.220]   You pray for accreditation.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.220]   They're the ones holding us up right now.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.220]   I see, I see.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.220]   Okay.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.220]   So we're going to just start with some of the questions.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   And, again, because you guys submitted the questions just today, we're just having him answer on the fly.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.220]   So thank you for doing that.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.220]   First one I'll give you is an easy one.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220]   I like easy ones.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:54.220]   The easiest one is how did you meet your girlfriend?
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.220]   That is an easy one.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.220]   That's good.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   We met in college.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:08.220]   Interesting the way it unfolded because she was a freshman that had come into college, and I was a junior at that particular time.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.220]   She knew my sister who was there.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:19.220]   And she expressed to my sister that she needed a ride to a nearby town to catch a bus to go home for the weekend.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.220]   And, actually, she was going home to break up with her high school sweetheart.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.220]   Okay.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.220]   I didn't know that at the time.
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   And my sister said, "Oh, my brother's got a car.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.220]   He can take you."
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.220]   So I was going through the cafeteria line one day, and she was working in the cafeteria.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:44.220]   And she introduced herself, and she says, "Would you be able to take me to Springfield, Ohio, to catch a bus to go home for the weekend?"
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.220]   I said, "Well, when do you need to go?"
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.220]   And she told me.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.220]   It was right on top of a big Greek class at that time.
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   Dr. George Lawler was the professor.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.220]   He was a very formal professor.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.220]   He always came to class with a three-piece suit on and a tie and everything.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.220]   And he made you stand.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.220]   He sat the whole class.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:11.220]   He made you stand with your Greek text and translate everything, parse every verb and every part of speech and the whole thing.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.220]   And you're standing there trembling while you're doing it.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:19.220]   He's looking at you like, all right, he's going to eat you or something.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.220]   You never skip Dr. Lawler's class.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.220]   Never.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.220]   Under penalty of death.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.220]   All right.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.220]   And so I had this terrible dilemma.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   Pretty girl, Greek class.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220]   This is a horrible dilemma to be put into.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.220]   All right.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.220]   Pretty girl won out.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.220]   I paid for it later in the Greek class.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.220]   So I took her on the way to Springfield.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.220]   We got to talking.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.220]   I thought, man, I've got to figure out a way to ask this gal out.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.220]   We just see eye to eye on so many things, and it's just really interesting conversation.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:11:01.220]   So we get there, and I sit there with her waiting until the bus to show up.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.220]   And so she's getting on the bus.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.220]   I said to her, I'll send you a bill for this.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.220]   And she kind of looked surprised, and she said, okay.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.220]   So she got on and went home for the weekend.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:22.220]   And so that whole weekend I made out in hand calligraphy, do one date for John Street's taxi service to the next basketball game type of thing,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.220]   sent it to her in inter-campus mail, and then I got cold feet.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.220]   I thought, man, this is really corny.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.220]   [ Laughter ]
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.220]   All right.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.220]   So I tried to get it back, and they treated inter-campus mail like it was the U.S. mail system.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.220]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.220]   We can't do that.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.220]   Can't give it back.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.220]   [ Laughter ]
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.220]   Whoa.
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.220]   So it went through.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:50.220]   So a couple days after she had returned, I get this envelope in the mail, and I open it, and it has a check in it for a million dollars worth of fund.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.220]   And that was our first date.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.220]   We still have those two pieces of paper.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:12:02.220]   [ Applause ]
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.220]   Funny thing about that is our second date we went with my roommate.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   He was engaged to be married, he and his fiancee, and in those days didn't have to wear seat belts, so bench seats in cars.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   His fiancee was sitting up real close to him as he's driving the car, and Janie and I are at either ends of the back seat, okay?
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:29.220]   And his fiancee leans over to him and says, "I love you."
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.220]   And I looked at Janie, and I said, "What did she say?"
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.220]   Janie said, "I love you."
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.220]   I said, "No, no, no.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.220]   What did she say?"
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.220]   So on the second date, she told me she loved me, and I --
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.220]   [ Laughter ]
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.220]   It's a true story.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.220]   >> Thank you for sharing with us.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.220]   Two people who could be corny together.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.220]   You guys are meant to be.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.220]   That's great.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.220]   Okay.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.220]   So now to some serious stuff.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.220]   Well, actually a lot of people were dying to know.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.220]   This question came in a lot.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:18.220]   Which was ending your first sermon, everybody felt like, wow, I've got so much sin in my heart, and then it ended at that.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:24.220]   So people were dying to know what is the difference between regeneration and rehabilitation.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:30.220]   You don't necessarily need to finish your sermon, but what's a little mini-rehabilitation?
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.220]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.220]   How do I sum this up?
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:42.220]   Well, when we're talking about rehabilitation, we're talking about basically a view of the human heart that's radically different from what the Bible presents.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:52.220]   Because you'll see this a lot, especially in Christian psychology today, where the heart is passive, empty, wounded, needy.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.220]   You'll hear a lot of that terminology going through a lot of Christian psychology books.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.220]   Passive, empty, wounded, needy.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   And you'll hear that needs-based kind of theology bleeding through people who have been integrated into psychology more than integrated really into scripture.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.220]   And that's not at all the way in which the Bible pictures the human heart.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:23.220]   It's not empty, needed, wounded, needy, empty, wounded, needy, and I forget the passive.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.220]   There we go.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   It's not that way at all.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.220]   In fact, it's sinful.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.220]   And at its very core, the human heart is full.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.220]   Now, fasten your seat belts.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.220]   Ready? Here we go.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.220]   It's full of self-love.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.220]   It's full of self-love.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:45.220]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say that people love themselves too little.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.220]   The Bible constantly warns that people love themselves way too much.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.220]   That's what gets them into trouble.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.220]   All right?
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.220]   That's what really gets them into trouble.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:02.220]   But yet, that's a cornerstone to a lot of Christian psychology today, that people don't love themselves enough.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.220]   That's such a key thing.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:10.220]   And this becomes the very reason behind sin.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.220]   I remember I had a student come in to me a few years ago.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.220]   That's when I was still teaching a couple undergrad classes.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.220]   I don't do that anymore, but she was a senior.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.220]   She was a really good student, smart.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.220]   And I was grading papers, which is the bane of every professor.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.220]   All right?
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.220]   I'm grading papers in my office, and she comes and knocks on the door, sticks her head in.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.220]   "Dr. Street, you got a moment?"
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.220]   I look at my papers, and I look at her, and I look at my papers, and I'm going, "Uh, sure.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.220]   Come on in."
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.220]   I know these things don't just take a moment.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.220]   She came in, plopped down in a chair, looked at the floor.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.220]   I said, "What's wrong?"
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.220]   She said, "I hate myself."
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.220]   I said, "You do?"
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.220]   "Yep."
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.220]   "I hate myself."
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.220]   "Are you miserable?"
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.220]   "Are you depressed?"
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.220]   "Yep."
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.220]   "I hate myself."
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.220]   Now, I know never to ask this question, but I do it anyhow.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.220]   Why do you hate yourself?
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:23.220]   Now, if you ask that question, be prepared for a long answer.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.220]   Okay?
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.220]   Be prepared for a long answer.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.220]   She started in, and it goes something like this.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.220]   I'm too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.220]   I'm not athletic enough.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.220]   I'm not academic enough.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220]   Nobody likes me.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220]   Everybody hates me.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.220]   Think I'll go eat worms type of thing.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.220]   And she went in 40 minutes.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:50.220]   40 minutes, she goes on and on, all the reasons why she hated herself.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:55.220]   And finally, she comes up for air at the end of 40 minutes.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   And I look at her, and I said to her, "I'm really confused."
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.220]   And she said, "What are you confused about?"
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:08.220]   I said, "Well, I'm trying to put myself into your shoes."
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.220]   "Okay.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.220]   Well, you said that you hated yourself, right?"
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.220]   "You said that you were miserable, right?"
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.220]   "Yeah.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.220]   You said you were even experiencing serious depression, right?"
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.220]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.220]   "Yeah.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.220]   Yeah."
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.220]   I said, "Well, that makes no sense to me."
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.220]   She said, "Well, why doesn't that make sense to you?"
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:38.220]   I said, "Well, listen, if I hated me, I mean I really hate me, I hate me.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:44.220]   If I really hate me, and all these other things were wrong, I'm too tall, too short, too fat,
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.220]   too skinny, I've got a crooked nose, I've got big ears, nobody likes me, everybody hates
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.220]   me, you think I'll go eat worms?"
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.220]   Then I'd say, "Ha!
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.220]   I hate me anyhow.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.220]   This is what I deserve."
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.220]   So I'm trying to figure out why you're so miserable.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.220]   That makes no sense to me.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.420]   Nowhere in the Bible, there's not a single reference anywhere in the Bible that says
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.900]   we love ourselves too little.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:12.980]   If that's the key to our well-being, then God left out a significant help to us.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.460]   The Bible is replete with the fact that we love ourselves too much.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.140]   That's what Jesus said when he was confronted by the Pharisees, right?
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.140]   What is the greatest commandment?
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.780]   The greatest commandment is, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind,
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.980]   and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   You say, "Wait a minute, there it is.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.980]   There it is.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.980]   Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.980]   Really?
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:38.780]   I mean, I've heard people say that turns what Jesus said into three commands.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.900]   I have to learn to love myself, then I can learn to love God and love other people properly.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.740]   So that's three commands, Jesus.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:52.900]   But in the very next verse, this is Matthew 22, verse 40, Jesus says, "On these," wait
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.220]   for it, "two commands the entire law hangs."
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.940]   Not three, two.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.940]   What is that?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.620]   How much we love God and how much we love other people.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:12.180]   As much as we love ourselves, Jesus actually assumes in that, that we love ourselves too
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:18.100]   much and if we loved God and loved other people to the degree that we already love ourselves,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.140]   we'd have great relationships, but we don't.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:29.060]   On those two commands, on those two pegs, the entire law hangs.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.060]   We talk about this in our graduate studies.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.340]   Every counseling situation that our students will ever face will go back to how much a
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.360]   person loves God and how much they love other people.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:46.040]   Everything goes back to those two, everything hangs on those two pegs in life, everything.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:53.180]   So it's interesting, but by the time I was finished, she was in tears.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.220]   She said, "Nobody's ever told this to me before."
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.520]   I went to several passages and showed her about it.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.940]   So about an hour later, I saw her in the cafeteria there at the university.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.280]   She's going through the salad line and she comes up to this big bowl of red cherry tomatoes
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.980]   and I'm watching her from across the cafeteria, all right?
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.100]   And she had a pair of thongs, tongs, excuse me, tongs, not thongs.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.020]   Wow, that was a Freudian slip, wasn't it?
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:29.060]   We'll just quickly go by that one.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:35.980]   And she was picking up each red cherry tomato, looking at it, putting it back in, picking
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.820]   up another one, looking at it, putting it back in the bowl, picking up one.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.060]   Oh, there's one she puts on her salad.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.740]   What is she doing?
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.480]   I know what she's doing.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.860]   She hates herself.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:56.360]   So she's looking for the worst cherry tomato in the bunch because that's what she thinks
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.180]   that she really deserves, not...
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.500]   What is she looking for?
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.100]   The best one, right?
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.100]   Why?
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.420]   Because that's always our default nature.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.980]   That's always our default nature.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.940]   Now if we're really thinking like a Christian, we'd find the best red cherry tomato in the
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.940]   bunch.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.780]   We'd find it and go, "Oh, there it is," and put it on the salad of the person behind us.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.620]   Now we're thinking like a Christian type of thing.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.540]   No, but our default nature is to always look out for self.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.540]   I'm going too long on this, aren't I?
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540]   This is great.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:40.540]   I don't know what the question was, but I'm getting like a sermon right in my face.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.780]   I know, sorry.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.780]   We got other questions.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.780]   I got to get the other questions.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.780]   Well, let's think about this.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   I mean, that just segues into a common question that came up, which is we're thinking about
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   the heart and we just all realize that we're not thinking about the heart.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:55.780]   And I think for a lot of people in here, we have so many young working professionals,
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.780]   young families who are trying to establish themselves.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:11.780]   And so they have to care about things like their careers, their next job, and their future.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:18.780]   And then the next thing you know, you consume their thoughts and their question is, "I
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.780]   have to do it because it's my responsibility.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   How do I know it's too much and inappropriate?
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.780]   Are there some benchmarks for us to test our hearts that it's not too big?"
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.460]   You know, the way that you asked that particular question is really important because oftentimes
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:46.460]   our benchmarks are humanly derived and they're not biblically derived benchmarks.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.260]   And that's where we get ourselves into trouble.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:54.980]   I have to, you know, I met a bunch of guys in counseling before who, they had it in their
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.140]   head, "I want to be a millionaire by the age of 35," type of thing.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.740]   In other words, I'm like a bulldozer and I'm going to run over everybody and everything
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.920]   until I reach that particular goal.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   That is so pagan.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   All right?
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.300]   And it just is.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:17.220]   It's almost as bad as a gambler because, you know, I've met people who were gamblers and
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.420]   they, you know, especially before they were a Christian, they gambled hundreds of thousands
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.740]   of dollars.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.660]   And then when they become a Christian, they know that gambling is all wrong, so they stop
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.060]   gambling, but they carry the same heart pattern right into their Christianity.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.780]   They go right into really risky business ventures.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.040]   All right?
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.080]   So what are they trying to do really?
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.400]   They're trying to get past one central command in Scripture.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.400]   What is that?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.300]   "Six days thou shalt work."
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.320]   You know, I want to get to a place when I'm young where I don't have to work anymore.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   Really?
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.900]   When God has commanded, "Six days you need to work."
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.900]   It's not the amount.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.080]   God doesn't say, "By the age of 40, you need to be a millionaire."
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.700]   He doesn't say that at all.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:08.900]   He says, "You need to learn to work and that's going to be your life and you need to be happy
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:14.020]   at working at what you're going to do."
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:21.780]   But if you have this alternative, in a sense, ungodly goal of reaching some kind of status
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.440]   or something like that, it's one thing to want to strive.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.520]   That's okay to do better.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.640]   That's one thing.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.120]   It's another thing to set that as an idolatrous desire that commands all of your thoughts
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.560]   and your thinking so much that you sacrifice your marriage, you sacrifice your relationship
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.940]   with your children, you sacrifice your commitment to Christ and your involvement in your church.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.280]   When you see these things starting to suffer, you know something is seriously wrong in your
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   life.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.520]   It may start off very imperceptibly, but then it grows as time goes by.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.680]   And all of a sudden, now this person is middle-aged and they have all this regret.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.380]   Their kids are growing up, angry, hateful, mean kids.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.760]   He and his wife are now distant.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.320]   It's not a real marriage anymore.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.720]   It's just a convenience.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:24.760]   At that particular point, he's making terrible decisions now, putting those things above
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.640]   people and above relationships.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.960]   Your first relationship has got to be to God himself.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.560]   Your second relationship is going to be to your spouse.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.960]   The third is going to be your children.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.800]   The fourth is to your church.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.640]   And you've got to make decisions based upon that.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.280]   And then your fifth is to your job and your responsibility in your job.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:50.840]   So now I could go into a lot of detail on that, but that's decision-making.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.960]   I appreciate that.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:11.480]   I think as you were talking, just reflecting on my own thoughts, just as a young man, I
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   have thoughts of certain wishes for my own family and things like that.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   But when you talked about having a specific vision that's so specific, it starts to garner
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   your commitments and then your decisions.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   And therefore, you're no longer thankful for what God has allotted you and given you, but
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   you have a goal that you have established.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   And then you know, "Oh, my desire, my intention is going to really understand."
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.400]   That's really good.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.040]   Thank you.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:30.400]   So that were just some of the questions in follow-up to the first session that we had.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:39.080]   I want to move now to a second question that's more general and something that you alluded
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:45.040]   to is, in the goal of reconciliation, is there always a way to reconcile with all the people
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.240]   you have conflicts with or are there just times it just won't work?
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.240]   And what do you do if, let's say, you may intend to reconcile with somebody, that person,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.760]   the other party, just doesn't want to do it?
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.160]   I think it's vitally important that that should always be our goal, but that doesn't mean
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   it's going to be possible.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   And let me explain to you why.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   Grab your Bible.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.600]   Let's go over to 1 Corinthians 11.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.840]   I may touch on this tomorrow in our last session, but if I don't have time, I might as well
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   do it now.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:29.760]   1 Corinthians 11, and here the Apostle Paul is describing the church of Jesus Christ,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:41.560]   and he says, verse 19, he says, "For there must also be factions among you so that those
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.920]   who are approved may become evident to all."
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:52.640]   In other words, sometimes in the church, it's a necessity that there's division, all right?
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:00.720]   Because it is that division that proves that some are approved of God and others are not.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.160]   And there's nothing you can do about that because you're taking a stand on truth, you're
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.400]   trying to be as loving to the opposing party as you can be, you're still open to have a
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:17.000]   reconciled relationship with them, but they are just adamantly opposed to the truth.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.200]   That's the reason why Paul says sometimes there has to be factions, there has to be
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:28.920]   divisions to see who's approved of God and who's not approved of God.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   All that is important.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   And then if you go over to Romans 12 there, and I highlighted this verse or I just mentioned
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:43.200]   it once earlier, he says in verse 18, "If possible," sometimes it's not, "so far as
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.920]   it depends upon you, be at peace with all men."
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.160]   Sometimes it doesn't depend upon you.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.680]   In other words, you've done everything you can in order to be at peace with that other
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:56.520]   person, and yet it's not possible, you can't do it.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:03.160]   Then you have to conclude that God is not at a point where He has really changed that
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.360]   other person's heart or their life, and if God hasn't changed their life at that point,
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:14.560]   then you need to pray for them that God will change them and work in their life so as to
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.640]   help them to be willing to reconcile.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.380]   So you've got to trust God's timing in this.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:28.940]   We would like to punch button A, B, C, and get a response, right?
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.020]   Because we love computers, we like that.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.480]   We hit a few keys, we get a response.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.140]   Hit a few keys, get a response.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.920]   That trains us for instant gratification.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.000]   That's not what happens in spiritual growth.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.920]   That's not happen, doesn't happen in the dynamic growth life of the church.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.620]   Sometimes it's hard, it takes a while to rebuild a relationship.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.880]   It's not going to happen instantly.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.240]   Sometimes it takes years to do so, to rebuild a relationship.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.480]   But you've got to remain committed to do that.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.600]   Even if the other person is close to do it at this particular time, that doesn't mean
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.960]   they're always going to be.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.480]   You need to pray for them that God will open up their heart so that they will be willing
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:22.080]   to do that, so that you have a better relationship than what you had prior to that conflict.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.000]   And then, of course, later on in verse 12, he says this.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.280]   He says in verse 20, Romans 12, he says, "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him, and if
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.320]   he's thirsty, give him a drink.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.260]   For in doing so, you will heap burning coals on his head.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.880]   Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.360]   Now, when he's talking about heaping burning coals, that's just ancient warfare terminology.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.840]   He's not talking about heaping guilt on people.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.560]   Our goal is not to heap guilt on people.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.520]   Our goal is to heap good on them, all right, to heap good on them.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.200]   That's the goal.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.560]   In order to have a right relationship.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.840]   All right, let me tell you a story real quick.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.920]   I'll try to keep it short, all right?
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   Several years ago, our oldest daughter, Krista, was going to school.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.920]   We lived in Ohio.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.640]   We're still pastoring in Ohio at that time.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:20.560]   I pastored there for almost 25 years.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.740]   And she would get on the bus to go to school, and there was a girl that was a year or two
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:33.240]   older than her that, for some reason, I don't know why, decided to take it upon herself
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   to make Krista's life miserable.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.100]   She would knock her books out of her hand.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.760]   She would draw all over her homework.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.880]   She would, you know, before she had a chance to turn it in, then she'd have all this messed
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.760]   up homework, and she'd just irritate her.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.080]   She'd just, I don't know.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.840]   So one day, I'm at home, and Krista came home from school, got off the bus, walked
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.240]   in the door, and she had tears in her eyes.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.560]   I said, "What's wrong, Krista?"
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:05.960]   And she said, "Well, Rachel's been bothering me again and doing some bad things and saying
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.840]   terrible things about me."
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.240]   Now as a human father, this is as a human father, Krista was always tall and big for
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.680]   her age.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:21.760]   I wanted to say to her, "Krista, just turn around and pop Rachel once real good.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.380]   She won't do that anymore, all right?
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.880]   She won't do that anymore," type of thing.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.160]   And my wife steps in, and she says, "Well, let's practice Romans 12."
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.760]   All right, practice Romans 12.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:45.440]   Yeah, and she says, "Well, you know, we've got this chocolate chip cookie recipe."
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.760]   And my wife does have a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.520]   It's the reason why I'm in the condition that I'm in.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:59.320]   Really good chocolate chip cookie recipe.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:05.880]   And so that night, they made piles of chocolate chip cookies, put them on a big plate, covered
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.440]   them with aluminum foil, and Krista and I walked them two blocks up the street to Rachel's
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   house.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.120]   And I stayed on the sidewalk, and Krista walked up to the door and knocked on Rachel's door.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.040]   And of all people in the household, Rachel came to the door, and she was shocked to see
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   Krista there.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.160]   Krista said, "You know, my family and I were making cookies tonight and thought you and
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.440]   your family would like them.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.920]   And Rachel's looking at these cookies like it's a bomb."
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:34.880]   You know, I'm watching out of the corner what's going on.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.640]   And so Rachel said, "Okay."
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.280]   And she took them in the house, and Krista walked back.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.240]   And on the way back, we're walking, and I said, "You know, nothing may come of this,
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.480]   Krista, but God is super pleased with what you did today.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.760]   Even if Rachel just continues this way, God is really pleased."
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   So heaping on good means heaping on really good chocolate chip cookies.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:05.160]   Do you know that Rachel became a really good friend of Krista's?
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:11.720]   And her whole family started coming to church and became believers.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:21.760]   And when her family left, her father got a job in Wisconsin and moved.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   She wrote a long letter to Krista and signed it, "Your best friend, Rachel."
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   Wow.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.040]   Now I'm not saying that heaping on good will always end up that way.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.560]   I'm not saying that.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.440]   But I think that should be our mentality.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:49.040]   When people do us evil, we overcome that evil with goodness.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:55.320]   We overcome that, especially another brother and sister in Christ, especially that.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.480]   Now Rachel and her family were not believers, but especially that should be a brother and
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.600]   sister in Christ overcome evil with goodness.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   So I want to get to a more generic question in relation to the biblical counseling world
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   as it relates to psychology.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Now I know in terms of on an academic level, it could take a long time to answer.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   What's the relationship between the two at that end?
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   But as you know, Dr. Street, in the experience of counseling, there are many people within
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   the church where perhaps they were struggling with the idea of counseling.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   And they were searching for help in any place.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:36:02.440]   And they were not always able to find it.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   And in the end, they were in the same place.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440]   And I think that's why there's so much confusion with the relationship between the
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   two.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   I'm not sure that's the best way to put it.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   But I think in terms of the general, it's more so not on the lines of academia, but
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.440]   within the church, how would you describe the relationship between psychology and biblical
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.440]   counseling, if there's any role at all for psychology within the church?
