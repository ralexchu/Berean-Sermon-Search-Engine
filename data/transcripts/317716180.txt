[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   Hopefully, you guys are a little bit refreshed from the breakfast or are you guys more sleepy?
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.000]   So, yeah, I'm sleepy.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.120]   There's a book that was written a while ago called Spiritual Depression, I don't know
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.960]   if you've ever seen it, by Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   But in the opening chapter, he actually says, "Talk to yourself, don't listen to yourself
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.080]   because the more you listen to yourself, the more depressed and negative you will become
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.920]   because most of the thoughts that go through your head are negative."
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.080]   And I think with anything, negative things actually sometimes weigh heavily more on us
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.720]   than just positive stuff.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.360]   You can hear nine compliments and it's the one criticism that we end up latching on to
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.640]   a lot of times, right?
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.280]   Yesterday's message was heavy.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.280]   But one thing I don't like about just like turn or burn messages, and that wasn't what
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.840]   it was, but, you know, turn or burn preachers, that's not the whole counsel of God.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.120]   That's one aspect ofâ€¦it's not necessarily wrong, but there is grace, forgiveness, God's
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.400]   goodness, security, eternal hope, salvation, all of that is also in what we looked at yesterday.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.160]   So what I want to do is look through this passage again and then read farther down and
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.480]   then we'll pray.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.520]   So starting at verse 13, and I'm hoping that you guys had good discussions yesterday and
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.400]   some of the stuff we're going to be covering today, you may have already talked about amongst
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880]   yourselves about how do we know whether or not we're saved.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.680]   But here we go, verse 13 down all the way to 29, all right?
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.080]   So just follow along.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.480]   "Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.280]   destruction and there are many who enter through it.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.480]   For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life and there are few who find
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   it.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.560]   Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.080]   wolves.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.680]   You will know them by their fruits.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles are they.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.400]   So every good tree bears good fruit but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.000]   A good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.980]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.840]   So then you will know them by their fruits.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.080]   Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.280]   does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.800]   Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.360]   name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.600]   Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.160]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.600]   Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them may be compared to
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.960]   a wise man who built his house on the rock.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.040]   The rock fell and the floods came and the winds blew and slammed against that house
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.720]   and yet it did not fall for it had been founded on the rock.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.320]   Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.560]   man who built his house on the sand.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.960]   The rain fell and the floods came and the wind blew and slammed against that house and
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.040]   it fell and great was its fall.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.000]   And when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching for he
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.880]   was teaching them as one having authority and not as their scribes."
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.680]   Let's pray together.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.640]   Father, thank you for this morning and we pray that you would speak, that you would
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:15.720]   really carve out the, just the junk on our hearts and that you would implant again afresh
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.600]   your holy word into the very fabric of our hearts and that your word would leave an indelible
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.680]   mark and impression on our souls.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.360]   So we pray that you would magnify your word this morning and pray these things in Jesus'
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   name.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.120]   So yesterday at night we learned that we need to be careful not to follow the crowds, to
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.240]   follow blind guides, nor to follow blindly and to not follow false fruits.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.880]   And you guys had good discussions.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:55.240]   Hopefully they were very honest, good reflection.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.000]   We talked about the road that leads to destruction yesterday, but if you look at this passage,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.960]   we also learned that there is indeed a path that leads to life.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   So what are we to do to ensure we're on the small and narrow, that we're on the right
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.760]   road, that we will enter the kingdom of heaven?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.960]   So if you actually look at verse 21 of chapter 7, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.600]   Lord,'" the other place in Scripture where you see this repeat, "Lord, Lord," is in the
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.040]   parable of the ten virgins.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.160]   The five virgins were not prepared in Matthew 25 verse 11.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.340]   They say, "Lord, Lord," too.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.280]   But there are five who are prepared, right?
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.640]   So in that parable, the five other virgins are well aware of the expectations of the
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.040]   bridegroom, they do the will of the bridegroom, and they wait patiently for him, so they do
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.400]   enter.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:08.240]   Verse 23, it says, "If Jesus does not know those who practice lawlessness," he also says,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.680]   "then who does he know?"
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.620]   Who enters the kingdom of heaven?
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.980]   Those who do practice the law, right?
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:24.020]   So if you look at this passage, you do see a group of people also entering the kingdom
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.560]   of God, okay?
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.340]   And I said yesterday, my assumption is that most of you are on that path, but you do need
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.820]   to examine because guaranteed, not all are on that path.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:44.820]   In every church, in every context, there are always people who look sound and feel like
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.460]   Christians, but they are not.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.660]   That's in every church.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.660]   Okay?
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.340]   There's a book called "Pagans in the Pews" that was written a few years ago that talks
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.760]   about that, okay?
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.900]   So you do need to reflect often.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.260]   So yesterday, basically, the message was be careful not to drift.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.880]   Today's point is, here's how not to drift, all right?
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.980]   So we're going to be looking at just this following passage.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.320]   So verse 24 starts with "therefore."
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.140]   And again, we're learning that the word "therefore" in every section of Scripture is very important.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.660]   It bridges what was said in a previous section.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   This high-tech stuff.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.660]   These, this, ugh.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.660]   Is that okay?
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.660]   Is it like flopping?
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.940]   Okay, we're good.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.100]   So "therefore" is very important.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.260]   Since you need to take care to enter the small and narrow, what do you need to do to ensure
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.620]   you are on the small and narrow?
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.620]   "Therefore."
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.900]   Okay, that's the whole section.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:55.580]   So those on the small and narrow, according to verse 24, are those who hear and do the
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.580]   word.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.260]   Hopefully, that sounds familiar to some of you guys, right?
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.460]   So when you guys memorize, who are, how many of you are memorizing through the book of
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.460]   James?
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.300]   Is this section reminiscent of anything that you've done, gone through so far?
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.780]   Yeah, to hear and do.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.860]   So what can save you, according to the book of James?
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.300]   The word that's in planet.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:27.480]   So we see in this passage, verses 24 and down, there are two builders, okay?
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.980]   One builds his house on the rock, one builds his house on the sand, the rain comes and
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.200]   tests its foundations.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.280]   So there are two guys here that are responding to the words of Christ.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.040]   And there are three things that both of these guys have in common.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.960]   The first thing that they have in common is both hear the word.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.940]   Yeah, that's the first thing they have in common, both hear the word.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:58.960]   So both of these builders, the one on the wide and the broad, the one on the small and
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.500]   the narrow, they're both building, okay?
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.160]   And both of these builders have an opportunity to be restored to the creator.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.120]   So that opportunity is given and there is no neutral response.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.600]   So you either respond positively or negatively, okay?
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.080]   So both hear the word.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.860]   And you guys know Romans 10, 17, it says, "And faith comes from hearing, and hearing
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.340]   by the word of Christ."
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.500]   So you cannot come to salvation without hearing the word of Christ.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.560]   So both hear it and their outcome is based on their response.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:44.960]   The second one, both are building, both are doing something in response to this word.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.760]   So this is general, but basically this individual is responding to what has already been revealed
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.380]   to him.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.960]   And we don't have too many details here about what building on sand looks like and what
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.420]   building on rock looks like.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.400]   But when you actually look through the other parts of Scripture, you can assume the one
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.120]   building on sand is responding in the flesh, okay?
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.080]   He's responding in the flesh.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:16.300]   And whether that's outright rebellion or a legalistic religious effort, he is building
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.860]   in the flesh.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:28.880]   So you hear the word of God and you can respond in the flesh, and that's building on sand.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.220]   But the point here is the guy who's building his house on the rock is the one who hears
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:42.020]   the word of God, and in a response of gratitude, he's building on the foundation of Christ,
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.220]   okay?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.360]   So how do we not drift is what we're going to be looking at today.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.560]   And how do we then build on this rock?
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.640]   And this is the definition I'm going to give you.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.200]   What does it mean to build on the rock?
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.760]   Building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, and living every
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.040]   day in the strength of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   And I'll repeat that.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.000]   What does it mean to build on the rock?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.180]   Building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, and living every
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:27.240]   day in the strength of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.460]   Building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, and living every
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.120]   day in the strength of the indwelling Spirit.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   That is what it means to build on the rock.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Okay?
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.320]   So first thing they have in common is both hear the word of Christ preached.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:48.200]   Second thing they have in common, both respond by building.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.620]   And the third thing they have in common is the wind and the rain come on both.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.640]   So both are judged.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.120]   Judgment comes to just test the foundation.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.200]   Okay?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.340]   Both hear the word, both are building, and both have the wind and the rain come.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.320]   So I gave you this definition, building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.240]   resurrection, and living every day in the strength of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   What is that?
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.000]   Okay, so I'm going to break it up into two parts.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.520]   So building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, turn with me
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.680]   in your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 3, and verses 11 to 13 is going to be what I'm
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   going to be reading.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:45.480]   1 Corinthians chapter 3, verses 11 to 13.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:54.800]   So building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection is this.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.400]   For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:10.280]   Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.400]   straw, each man's work will become evident, for the day will show it because it is to
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:22.680]   be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.840]   I'll keep reading a little bit more.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.080]   If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.920]   If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.560]   as through fire.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.280]   Do you not know that you are the temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.040]   Okay, so I'm going to stop there.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:55.920]   So the foundation is Christ, and from that foundation of Christ, all of our religious
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.880]   activity, all of our life is a grateful response to the mercies of God and the sacrifices of
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.600]   Christ.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.560]   You do not do anything to earn your salvation.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.840]   You can't do anything to gain extra favor from God.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:19.200]   Everything that you build on is out of a grateful response to this great privilege of a relationship
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.840]   that you've been given.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:28.940]   So if you are actively trying to serve God to impress people, if you're trying to actively
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:36.540]   serve God to run away from your past, if you're trying to actively serve God in order to get
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.480]   extra reward in heaven, you're building wrong.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:51.200]   So Christ's life, death, and resurrection, everything was sufficient for our inheritance
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.960]   as princes in the kingdom of God.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.580]   So it was sufficient.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.760]   We have access to God.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.480]   You can't add to that.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:06.640]   You cannot do more to be more loved on by God.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.700]   You guys following me?
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.900]   So the question is not so much, if I do this, will I lose my salvation?
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.240]   If I engage in this kind of sin, will God throw me into hell?
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.420]   That's not the question you should be asking.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:28.620]   The question is, am I giving God my whole heart as he deserves?
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.700]   Am I giving God my very soul as he deserves?
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:39.060]   Is my worship to God really with all of me?
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.860]   That's the question that we should be asking rather than, is this going to cause me to
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.860]   be church disciplined?
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.500]   Is this going to cause me to be condemned into hell?
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.620]   Okay?
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:55.740]   So building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:03.200]   Second, living every day in the strength of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.080]   So your effort to please God is not going to be what bears fruit.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.600]   Okay?
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.880]   So we're looking at this morning, the parable of the four soils.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.080]   It's a word of God that bears a fruit.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.640]   Your effort does not bear the fruit.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   Okay?
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.880]   So if you're like, oh, I'm going to win more souls to Christ, that's not going to bear
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   fruit.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.040]   Oh, I'm going to be more godly this coming year, that's not going to bear fruit.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.720]   What's going to bear the fruit is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   Right now I'm 40 years old.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:42.240]   Up until I was 25, I did not look anything like my dad, except my shoulders and my hands.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.880]   So when my wife met my dad for the first time, she said the first thing that she noticed,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.080]   and really the only thing that she kept looking at was his hands.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.280]   Because they're short fingers, they're a little bit chubby, but you make a fist, it's pretty
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.760]   wide, enough to kind of cover a whole face.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.920]   Short fingers, thick and chubby.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.480]   So it's like sausages.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.800]   So she was like, your dad has sausage fingers too.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.720]   So that's the only thing.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.640]   The rest of me is all my mom, except the shoulders and my hands.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:25.360]   And that's interesting because now, so my, Rebecca met my dad when I was around 24, 25.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.920]   But now as I'm getting older, whenever my relatives see me, they actually say, it's
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.640]   so weird.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:38.000]   You looked nothing like your dad, but now more and more, like I see your dad in your
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.320]   face.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.120]   Your frame is starting to become more like your dad.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   Now is that something that I try to do?
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.240]   Do I try to make my hands extra sausagey?
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.900]   What happens if I eat too many things, right?
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:58.760]   It becomes thicker, but the natural frame is not something that I have to try to be
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.080]   like my dad in.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.440]   It is part of my DNA.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.040]   Now if I just feed myself, if I sleep, if I exercise, if I just maintain my body, all
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.840]   of that latent potential in my DNA will get me to looking like my father.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.400]   How many of you guys look like your parents?
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Like spot on.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.000]   Do you try to be that?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   No.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.500]   It happens.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:31.500]   So we are building in a response of worship to God, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ who
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.880]   is dwelling in our hearts is going to be doing all the work.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.260]   So if you are a child of God, you're going to start resembling your heavenly father more
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:52.780]   and more with each passing day as long as you are maintaining and eating and drinking
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.300]   and resting.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.480]   You will look more and more like your heavenly father.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.660]   You know, if I, let's say, don't eat for like five months, six months, regardless of my
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.860]   DNA, I probably will not look like my dad.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.860]   You guys following me?
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.300]   I will look shriveled and sick and gaunt.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:21.180]   But if I just proceed normally as I would day to day, I start resembling my father more
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.180]   and more.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.920]   And that was a question that we asked yesterday, like in the last five years, and five is an
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.620]   arbitrary number, but five years is enough where you can kind of gauge, am I more Christ-like
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.260]   now than I was five years ago, or am I exactly the same?
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.540]   That was why that question was in there.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.100]   How do you build on the rock of Christ?
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:47.940]   You eat, you drink, you rest, and he does all the work.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.320]   You guys following me?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.340]   If you try to earn more favor from God, you are working and responding in the flesh.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.740]   That is not how you get on to the small and the narrow.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.140]   Building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, and living every
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.100]   day in the strength of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.060]   I am a human being.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:21.640]   When I was born, I don't remember this, but I probably craved milk as a human being.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.300]   I did not crave plankton.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.660]   I did not crave worms.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:34.220]   I did not crave what other animals eat.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:40.060]   As a human being, I was born and I craved milk.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.020]   If you are a child of God, this is one way to know for sure.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:49.980]   If you have zero craving for the Word of God, if you have zero desire to grow in your knowledge
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:56.100]   of the Word of God, if you have absolutely no interest in what God has to say, you are
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.100]   not a Christian.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.300]   Does this make sense?
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.700]   Animals crave milk.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.940]   Fish do not.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:14.660]   So you can tell whether or not you're on this wide and the broad.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.860]   If you're someone who loves church, who loves hanging out, who's always quick to try to
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.280]   do stuff at church, but you have zero desire for the Word of God and communion with God,
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.460]   you are not a child of God.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.060]   And that's one of the surefire ways to tell if someone is genuinely a believer or not.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:40.780]   A spiritual soul will crave pure spiritual milk of the Word of God.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.260]   Now we all stumble, and that's for sure.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.940]   We all kind of like sway a little bit.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.380]   We all like struggle.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.980]   We trip, we fall, we, you know, in James chapter 3 verse 2, if you guys are memorizing through
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.560]   it, what does it say?
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.540]   We all stumble in many ways.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.140]   If anyone is able to shoot.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:08.460]   No, we all stumble in many ways.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.460]   I had this.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.180]   I did this just this morning.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.500]   Is a perfect man, or we all stumble in many ways, but if anyone doesn't stumble in what
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.620]   he says, he's a perfect man able to bridle his whole body as well, right?
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.340]   Okay, see, that was actually on purpose.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.260]   It's just to test you guys.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.700]   We all stumble.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.840]   We are not perfect.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:36.380]   But at the end of the day, there's going to be something in your heart that longs to have
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.340]   God.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.780]   Okay?
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.780]   And on that longing, you will be building.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:52.780]   So the Holy Spirit working in our hearts through His Word is what bears fruit, and that's all
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.140]   over Scripture.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.620]   One more time, the Holy Spirit, which is a seal and deposit, it's our spiritual DNA,
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.620]   right?
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:09.740]   The Holy Spirit working in our hearts through His Word will bear fruit.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.540]   Not your effort.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.100]   The why is more important than the what you do.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:25.020]   And the why, if it's all Holy Spirit just producing work, you will be sanctified and
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.340]   you will grow and you will become more and more like Christ and you can't stop it.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.740]   Okay?
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.660]   If the Holy Spirit is working within your hearts.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.540]   This morning, I had you guys read through the parable of the four soils.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.500]   And this is something you guys are probably familiar with.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.100]   We teach it in Sunday schools.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.100]   Okay?
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.220]   First soil.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.220]   It's not even a soil.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   It's a path.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.220]   Right?
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.140]   The first thing I think is like, man, when I initially thought about this, I thought,
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.020]   what a bad farmer.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.300]   He's throwing seed onto the sidewalk.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.420]   Right?
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.500]   What a derelict, like, that's like such a waste.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.140]   But then I started thinking about why he did that and it made me appreciate God a little
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.140]   bit more.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.140]   Why does he do this?
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.700]   Because he gives everybody an opportunity.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.700]   Okay?
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:15.300]   He just throws it out there and then we read that the devil takes it away.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   In Matthew's account, it says the message of the kingdom is preached and the people
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.300]   don't get it.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.740]   They don't understand it.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.820]   So the devil just snatches it away.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:31.320]   The second soil is rocky soil.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.900]   So it has soil with rocks in it and it looks like it's bearing fruit.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:42.960]   Sometimes actually, it bears fruit faster.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.620]   The temptation comes in, persecution comes in, and it kills the fruit because there's
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.620]   no roots.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.460]   And that's the second type of soil.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:00.040]   Third type of soil you guys read about this morning, it's a type, a soil that has thorns.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.440]   So as a fruit is growing up, what happens?
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.500]   These thorns come and choke it out.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.480]   And I will say this, for you guys living in Orange County, you are more like, you are
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.660]   more in danger of being like soil three than two.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:21.520]   But somewhere between two and three is where we may all be if we're not careful.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.160]   Okay?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.080]   So look at chapter eight, verse 14 of Luke.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.520]   You don't need to turn there, but it says this.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:45.880]   The worries of this life, riches, and pleasures choke the word and there is no fruit.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.160]   Is this not Orange County?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.520]   What are those three things?
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.740]   Worries, riches.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.060]   In Matthew 13 it says the deceitfulness of wealth, it's the same thing.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:07.400]   Worries, riches, pleasures.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.760]   You need to be careful of these thorns that you don't drift.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.600]   Not just if you're following me.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.020]   Okay?
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:31.980]   You may have desires to grow Godward, but these thorns, worries, riches, pleasures come
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.240]   and choke it out.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.280]   What are worries?
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.480]   Man, my retirement isn't enough.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:48.180]   Man, what will people think of me if everyone has a house and I don't?
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.860]   Will I ever be able to get married working this job?
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.860]   What if I never get married?
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.620]   God forbid.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:02.540]   What if they don't accept me?
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.020]   What if I get sick?
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.500]   And a lot of times we're working hard to make sure everything's protected.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   Right?
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   Worries.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.180]   What's the second one that he lists?
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.180]   Riches.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.940]   I keep emphasizing that the opposite of poor is not rich.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.620]   The opposite of poor is what?
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.620]   Enough.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.820]   And everything beyond enough you're supposed to use to build the kingdom of God.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.100]   That's scriptural.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.600]   Opposite of poor is not rich.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.240]   The opposite of poor is enough.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.860]   And everything outside of enough, everything outside of your daily bread, you're supposed
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:38.220]   to be investing into the kingdom of God, not padding your future, what do you call that?
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   Security.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   Riches.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.220]   Okay?
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.820]   You guys may not be blatantly materialistic.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.100]   There's no Maseratis out in our parking lot.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.300]   There's no Lamborghinis out in our parking lot.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   Is there?
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   No.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:58.820]   You might not necessarily be flashy, but in your heart there is this susceptibility.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.260]   It's still early for me.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.260]   There's a susceptibility to want this world.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.580]   First John 2.15, what does it say?
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.580]   Do not love the world or anything in the world.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.140]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.140]   Be careful.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.140]   And the third one is what?
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.140]   Pleasures.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.460]   Worries, riches, pleasures.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.500]   Some of you are like, "No worries.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500]   I don't worry about the future.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   Live for today.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   Carpe diem.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   Seize the day."
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   Right?
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   And all the FOMO and all that stuff.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.300]   I'll just do it, you know, I only live once.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.980]   Oh, that's not FOMO.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.980]   YOLO.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.980]   Okay?
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.180]   You know, I only learned BOGO like two weeks ago.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.540]   What is all this stuff?
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.540]   What?
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.540]   No worries.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.540]   I don't need to worry about my future.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.540]   Some of you guys are like, "Dude."
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.940]   Millennials are like, "Yeah, I'm not really -- I don't really care too much about like
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.940]   wealth.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.940]   I'm more about the experiences."
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.940]   Right?
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.180]   Pleasures.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:59.220]   As soon as I come home, I deserve to be entertained.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.420]   I deserve to enjoy me time.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.420]   Right?
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:09.500]   And so there are those dangers.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.300]   And I don't even need to elaborate on these things.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.980]   Your brain can already just kind of go to what those dangers are.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.460]   So be mindful.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:25.220]   Fourth fruit or fourth soil is born long-term.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.700]   So it actually doesn't look like it has fruit in the beginning, but you give it enough time,
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.580]   it becomes an unshakable tree.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:48.940]   That no matter what happens, it's being just strong, stable, mature, unflappable, unshakable.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.580]   And there has been an anchoring of the soul.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:58.660]   And if this soil were a house, the foundation would be the rock of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:08.660]   Again and again in Scripture, you'll see who enters the kingdom of heaven.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.220]   In the parable of the four soils, actually, Luke chapter 8 verse 21, okay?
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.380]   The parable of the four soils and then a little bit after that, "Hey, your mother and your
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.300]   brothers are here, Jesus."
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   And he says, "Who are my mother and my brothers?
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.660]   Whoever does the will of God is my mother and my brother and my sister."
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.780]   That's what he actually says.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:34.620]   So all over Scripture, one thing that you will notice that is the central theme is whoever
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.820]   hears these words of mine and puts them into practice, he is the one who has access to
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.420]   the kingdom.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.940]   So that's the kind of person you would want to be, I'm assuming, right?
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.220]   So what are the acts of building?
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:54.820]   It's building on the foundation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection and living every
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.420]   day in the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:08.420]   So like I shared, if you are a child of God, you will crave pure spiritual milk of the
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:14.180]   Word and as you feed off of the Word, you will bear fruit in your life.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.440]   So it's not like you try to bear fruit so you can access the kingdom of heaven.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:25.980]   This is talking about Jesus Christ, who is your intercessor, whose work on the cross
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.200]   was perfectly efficacious, which means he will accomplish what he wants to accomplish
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.800]   in your life.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.960]   You can't stop it if he wants you saved.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:41.900]   But if you are that person, he is going to bear fruit in your heart and in your life.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.060]   So how do we apply all these truths?
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:51.980]   So therefore, and many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.820]   name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many miracles?"
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.740]   And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.420]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness."
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:06.060]   Therefore, how do we apply this?
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:11.920]   And you guys are Bereans, so you already know this, but you need to know the Word.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.580]   You need to become excellent students of the Word.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:22.340]   Now, don't get me wrong, reading, studying, and memorization of the Bible do not lead
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.980]   to salvation.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:34.420]   But you need to hear a lot so that you can do a lot.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:42.120]   You need to constantly be hearing the Word of God so that you can grow.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.080]   Now the question that you may or may not be asking in your head is, "Okay, how much Bible
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.680]   intake is enough?"
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.180]   Anyone have an answer?
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.240]   How much Bible intake is enough?
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.580]   I'll answer it like this, okay?
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.700]   You don't need to grow in his Word anymore once you're free of sin.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.400]   Until then, you need to intake his Word as if your very soul depended on it.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.720]   And we learned yesterday, does your soul depend on the intake of the Word of God?
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   Yes.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:18.480]   You need to feed off of the Word of God as if your very soul depended on it.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.960]   Personally, for me, I am so easily corruptible.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.400]   I see this in my heart.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.120]   As I get older, the more and more I realize there is nothing good inside of me outside
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.480]   of Christ.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.400]   There's nothing good in me outside of Christ.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.600]   So don't ever put your trust in me or any other pastors because outside of Christ, there
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.800]   is nothing good in us.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.200]   I am easily tainted.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.920]   So how much for someone who's easily tainted, super corrupt like me, how much intake of
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.760]   the Word of God is enough?
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:55.520]   And I'll share with you personally, I calculated this.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.160]   I'm in the Word about 12 hours a day.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.460]   And that's not an exaggeration.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:05.680]   I am in the Word 12 hours a day.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:21.840]   And I'm still having to fight selfishness, irritability, pride, insecurity, greed, lust,
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:30.320]   mindless entertainment, gluttony, vanity.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.640]   And in those 12 hours, as I'm doing these, just thinking through, reading the Word of
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.320]   God, I am constantly bombarded by temptation.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.520]   Do you know how many times I download a game onto my phone and then delete it two seconds
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   later?
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   I'm like, "That's so immature."
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.880]   Do you know how many times I like, like when you're just scrolling through a website and
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.720]   there's an inappropriate image that you're almost tempted to click on it, do you know
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.280]   how many times it lingers for a second?
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:11.800]   When there's an opportunity to show myself off, I want so much to take it.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.600]   When I meet with old pastor friends, I want to tell them that I'm thriving in my ministry
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.000]   and then I wonder why.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.240]   Is it to show them that like, like I'm aptly qualified for this job that I'm doing?
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   When I see my kids, I'm like, "Oh, OK.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.840]   I played with them about 47 minutes.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.400]   That's enough for my wife not to nag at me."
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.960]   Like, like there's always these wrestling things that are going on in my heart.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:44.720]   So for me, the average of about 12 hours is not enough.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   And because I was just thinking through all of this, wrestling with my weakness, I've
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.880]   actually started craving the Word of God more.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.480]   Over the last few weeks, I've actually turned off the radio altogether.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:03.120]   So when I'm driving, I'm just going through the Word, the books of the Bible in my head.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.000]   And it's still not enough.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.400]   I stopped watching Netflix.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   I have zero games.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.720]   Oh, I left the Bible trivia games.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.320]   Because sometimes when you're, you know, doing your business in the bathroom, sometimes you
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320]   need something.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.720]   And I don't like going through the Word of God while I'm doing that.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.600]   But I've cut out everything.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.080]   Not because those are things that like about, "Oh, is that sin?
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   Is that not sin?"
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:40.480]   No, because my soul is so sick and tired of tripping and falling and stumbling.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.440]   I hate this prone to wander heart.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.280]   So I just cut out stuff.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.520]   Because it's not so much I'm worried about my salvation.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   I am not.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.040]   And I'll talk about that later tonight.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.720]   I have absolute freedom before God.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.480]   I'm not worried about my eternal destiny.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.520]   Because there is so much confidence, not in my flesh, but in the fact that God delights
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.000]   in me.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.560]   But I want so much to give God glory and I hate the fact that I keep messing up at it.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.760]   So I'm like, "Lord, I need you."
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:20.720]   And so I am in His Word.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   I think I should just use a regular mic next time.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.480]   It'll calm me down.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:40.560]   I'm in His Word.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:54.400]   Because if I'm not in His Word, I'm distracted.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.440]   Distraction leads to entanglement.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:04.480]   Entanglement leads to fruitlessness.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:13.600]   If there are things that are in your life that's potentially causing you to drift, you
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.760]   need to cut them out and pursue Christ.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.080]   It's simple.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.760]   Or easier said than done.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.160]   As simple as that.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.000]   If there is something that is distracting you, potentially entangling you, rendering
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.720]   you fruitless, you have to cut it out.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.000]   But the problem is, you don't want to cut it out.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.120]   Now, I'm sure you understand what I'm saying.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.200]   I hate the fact that I love sin.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.280]   And I know you guys hate the fact that you love sin.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:12.120]   But the only way to have victory really and enjoy it in Christ is to run away.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.880]   But when you're running away from sin, you have to have something you're running toward.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.040]   And if you're trying to just run away in your own strength, "I will not watch this.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.280]   I will not do this.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.400]   I will not buy this.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.760]   I will not call him.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.240]   I will not call her."
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:34.520]   Though if that is all in your own strength and in your flesh, it won't work.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.400]   You have to pursue Christ.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   Amen?
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.000]   You guys follow me?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.160]   So how much Word is enough?
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:53.040]   There are 1,189 chapters in the Bible, 929 in the Old Testament, 260 in the New.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:01.600]   There are 31,102 verses in the Bible, 23,145 in the Old Testament, 7,957 in the New.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.280]   How much of it do you need?
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.320]   All of it.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.040]   The Great Commission says, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:21.280]   in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and teaching them," what?
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.680]   "Everything that I commanded you."
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.440]   Some of you guys who have a heart for missions and evangelism, are you going to just go and
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   win them over to yourself?
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   What are you going to do?
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   What are you going to teach them?
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.840]   What are you going to feed them?
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.440]   And how are you going to feed them if you're not being fed?
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.800]   Are you going to take the pastors with you on every evangelistic crusade?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:54.680]   How are you going to take on this baton of teaching them everything that I commanded
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.960]   you if you're not in the Word?
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.520]   All of it.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.040]   I'm discovering that I can't survive without His Word and I'll tell you what's not God's
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   Word.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.800]   The Word of God is not God's Word.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.080]   It's about God's Word and they're useful but God's Word is first.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:21.920]   And for you guys who are into theology, make sure you're in the scriptures and let the
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.800]   Word of God form your theology, not the other way around.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.960]   Quiet time books are not God's Word.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.920]   Some of you guys have been in quiet time books for a long time.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.800]   That's an interpretation of someone's words.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.320]   Or that's an interpretation, someone's interpretation of God's Word.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   That's not God's Word.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.280]   You need to feed off of the Word of God.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.880]   The purpose of your life is to know God and to make Him known.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.120]   Amen?
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.600]   What's your purpose?
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.960]   To know God and to make Him known.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.880]   The purpose of your life is not your comfort.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.460]   The purpose of your life is not your success.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.920]   The purpose of your life is not church involvement.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.040]   It's not fame.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.120]   It's not wealth.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.560]   It's not home ownership.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.600]   It's not status.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   It's not marriage.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.760]   It's not parenthood.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.280]   Not humanitarian efforts.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.600]   The purpose of your life is to know God and to make Him known.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.680]   Have you strayed from that purpose?
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:25.120]   And if so, I can guess that your intake of the Word is not very strong.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.800]   The purpose of your life is to know God and make Him known.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:39.080]   So if you ever say you are too busy to read your Bible, your life is characterized by
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.000]   sin.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Let me repeat that.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.360]   That's pretty strong.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:43:00.480]   If you ever say that you are too busy to read the Word of God, your life is being led in
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:07.440]   your flesh and there is rebellion in your life.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.560]   Craving for the Word of God is a reflection of your heart.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.080]   It's not a reflection of your schedule.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.000]   And I didn't say skim the Word of God.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.640]   I said read.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.240]   And that's one thing I don't like about Bible reading plans because it makes me skim.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.440]   Now, if you guys understand what that feels like, yeah.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.640]   Oh, shoot, I have five chapters to read.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   And I did it, seven minutes.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.560]   The purpose of your life is to know God and to make Him known.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.920]   And whatever it takes for you to become an expert in the Bible, do it.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.860]   Help others to do it.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:50.960]   And I want to share with you about how I ended up here.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:56.760]   My life was a mess.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.320]   And I became a pastor because I was good with people.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.860]   My life was a mess.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.080]   I could not control my thoughts.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.280]   I could not control my emotions.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:16.700]   My very standard of right and wrong was skewed and I saw my life falling apart.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.780]   So I decided just to start memorizing His Word because I realized I can't change my
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.580]   thoughts.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:31.620]   Memorization and review of verses that I learned as a child turned into clumps of sections
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.040]   of Scripture.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.600]   And then it turned into the book of Philippians.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.340]   And then it went from Philippians to 1 John because when I started coming to Berean in
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.380]   '03, we were studying the book of 1 John.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:49.720]   So I was like, "Hey, why don't I just memorize it as we study it?"
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.260]   That turned into, "Oh, I don't know anything about this Old Testament prophet section.
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:55.980]   It sounds â€“ they're so interesting.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   It's so weird.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.980]   I don't know anything.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:58.980]   I don't know how to touch it."
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.620]   So I decided just to memorize Obadiah because one time â€“ it was a very short book.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.460]   But then I realized, "Oh, I could do this."
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.820]   So then I went to Habakkuk and Zephaniah.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.660]   I was like, "Wait a minute.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.460]   I'm able to retain all this stuff."
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.380]   And then I went to James and Galatians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Peter, 2
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.380]   Peter.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:26.700]   Next â€“ over time, I discovered that because I wanted it, it was easier for me to remember
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.900]   this because I was doing it for survival.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.540]   It turned into 34 books of the Bible.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.900]   And that changed my life.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.060]   It changed my thinking.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.900]   It changed my attitude.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.940]   It changed my behavior.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.380]   It took away my temper.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.540]   It took away my foolish decisions.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:56.740]   It caused me to be a better person, better pastor, better that time boyfriend.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:04.020]   You know, before I got married, I told Becky, "I'm like this.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.500]   And I want to protect you from me.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.680]   I'm going to do everything that I can not to mess this up.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:17.220]   And I don't want to hurt you by being a bad boyfriend, hopefully, fiance, and then
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.220]   husband.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.580]   I'm like this."
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:27.620]   And about two years ago, around year 10 of our marriage, Becky said to me, "You know,
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.620]   you've never been this."
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:38.220]   I was like, "Dude, God changed my life.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.620]   It wasn't my effort.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.580]   He just started speaking to me every day through His Word.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.460]   I wanted to do snooze button, but Proverbs 6, 6, 'Go to the ant, you slugger, consider
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.460]   its ways and be wise.'
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:54.500]   Oh, as the door turns on its hinges, so the slugger turns in his bed.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.620]   Every single thing started being dictated by the Word of God and started pinballing
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.840]   me in the direction that God wanted me to go.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.880]   It changed me.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.380]   It impacted my very personality.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:18.940]   God speaks to me every single day, and sometimes I find it super annoying.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.920]   But He does, not with an audible voice, but with His Word.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.460]   You know, my decision to come back to Berean, I just prayed five minutes.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.180]   I prayed, "Lord, my dad asked me to come back.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.180]   What do you want me to do?"
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.900]   Boom, honor your mother and father.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.380]   This is the first commandment, the promise, 1 Timothy 5.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.420]   If anyone doesn't take care of his own family, he is worse than an unbeliever.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:46.140]   And I know in context it might mean something different, but God spoke to me through those
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:50.840]   and took me five minutes to take three steps backward in my career to come here.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   And I haven't been happier.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.860]   This is the happiest I've been in 10 years.
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:55.940]   You know how I ended up in China?
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:56.940]   I hate China.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.780]   Okay, let me rephrase this.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.900]   Hate's a strong word.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.900]   Not Chinese people.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.500]   I didn't say Chinese people.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.900]   We were sent to China to be there for one year.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.720]   I committed to two more years.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.580]   And then in the third year, even though I did not like China very much, I committed
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.520]   to the rest of my life there.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.540]   Because I couldn't shake this fact that the command is to go.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.780]   And I'm wrestling with this call to stay in America.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.100]   The command is to go.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.220]   We need to be wrestling with the call to stay.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.020]   Are you guys following me?
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:36.140]   The command is to bloom where you're planted.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:42.260]   So I begrudgingly kept extending our stay in China.
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.500]   It helped that the food was good.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:50.740]   And it just took me for a journey.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:56.420]   Every aspect of the last 10 years, 15 years of my life has been dictated by the word of
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.420]   God.
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.660]   It's changed me.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.700]   And I'm seeing fruit.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.500]   That's why I want you guys to memorize.
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.820]   Not to make you appear more holy, because it'll change you.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.860]   And some of you guys, I hear you joking around.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.540]   "Brattle that tongue."
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.300]   Or, "Hey, you know, like, if anyone considers himself religious and does not brattle his
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.300]   tongue, his religion is worthless."
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.660]   You know, like, I hear you guys quoting that to each other.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.660]   That's beautiful.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.780]   Speak to each other in scripture.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:33.420]   So here are a few things that I'm regularly reminded of as I'm studying the word of God
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.140]   and as I'm looking to do it.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.460]   One, God is God and I am not.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.100]   That's in almost every chapter of the scriptures.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.100]   God is God, I am not.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.100]   Isaiah 55, 9.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.500]   You guys have heard this before.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.660]   For my ways are higher than your ways, or for as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.580]   so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts then?
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580]   Your thoughts.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   You know what God is saying?
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:01.260]   If I'm going to put it in a, if I could twist that, "You are infinitely stupid compared to
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.020]   me," is what God is saying.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.820]   And I'm reminded of my stupidity before God every day.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:15.140]   So people, someone has asked me, "Hey, you've memorized so much.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.380]   Doesn't it ever cause you to be arrogant?"
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.380]   Absolutely not.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:25.180]   It causes me to be terrified because I am more aware of how far I fall short.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:30.140]   God is God, I am not, and if you get to know the scriptures, you will realize how holy
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:36.580]   he is, how great he is, and how dirty and small and puny and insignificant you and I
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.380]   are.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.020]   Another thing that I realize as I meditate through the word of God every day is this
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.780]   earth is not my home.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.300]   How often does the scripture call you aliens and strangers?
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.300]   All over the place.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:54.540]   But you guys are trying to take up residence in Orange County as if this is your eternal
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:59.380]   destination so that you enjoy a nice heaven here and then go to a nicer heaven in heaven
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.720]   because death comes to all of us, right?
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.060]   This place is not your home.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:13.660]   You know, I've been to many hotels, possibly more than half of you all combined.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:18.100]   I've spent a lot of night, 100 days a year I was not in Korea when I was working at Compassion.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.960]   I was in a hotel.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.220]   And as nice as that hotel is, I don't buy new curtains for that hotel.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.540]   I don't buy a new couch.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.700]   "Oh, that TV is ugly," or "Oh, that sofa is not, you know, to my liking."
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:36.300]   You don't readjust a hotel room, you just enjoy it for a time and then you check out.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.140]   You don't take ownership of that hotel room.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.420]   That's the same thing.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.900]   You guys are wandering through this life.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.340]   Your home is in heaven.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.780]   Don't root down too much.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:54.900]   That's like me buying a new toilet for a hotel I'm going to stay in one day.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.900]   "Ooh, warm."
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:56.900]   Right?
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.060]   Like, you know, you know what that is, right?
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:05.860]   To stay in a nice hotel for one day and I invest in a fancy toilet, that's stupidity
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.980]   and that's folly.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:14.120]   But that's how some of you guys are tempted to live, like that third soil.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.980]   My home is here until I die and then I'm going to enjoy a nicer home.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.980]   No, it's not.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:24.080]   You're a tent pitcher here.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:40.400]   And whenever you make a decision to peg that tent peg harder in this life, be careful.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.120]   Not sure if you understand why I'm saying be careful.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.080]   This is not your home and that's another thing I'm reminded of.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:50.160]   Third thing I'm reminded of is eternal life has already started for me.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.360]   Eternal life does not start when you are in a coffin.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.200]   When does eternal life start?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.000]   Now, because eternal life, John 17, 3, this is eternal life that they may know you, the
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.200]   only true God that Jesus Christ for me have sent.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.680]   Eternal life has already started.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.960]   It's like this.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:18.400]   I'm engaged to be married and once I get married, once we have our wedding, I will start asking
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.760]   questions and getting to know my wife.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:31.160]   The engagement process, there's already a commitment but you are getting to know each
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:38.040]   other through that whole process until you're finally wedded.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.940]   Eternal life has already started.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:43.040]   Take advantage starting now.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.120]   Get to know this God.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.760]   Get to know this Christ now.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   Another thing that I'm regularly reminded of in the scriptures is that I'm loved.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:54:06.080]   I am so loved and I am so aware of how much that I am loved, I feel so free.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.240]   When I stumble, I get up right away.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.360]   Oops, sorry dad.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.320]   I'm up.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.040]   My kids, they cause all kinds of problems every day.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.680]   They draw on things they're not supposed to, they break things that they're not supposed
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.720]   to, they open stuff they're not supposed to.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.400]   That does not change my love for them.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.440]   And in a moment, I hug them, kiss them, roll around with them because they're my children
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.840]   and they have freedom to do whatever they want because they know my love is not going
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.080]   to change.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:39.780]   And because I am daily reminded of the love of God for me, I am free to love the people
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.520]   around me.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.400]   We love because he first loved us, 1 John 4:19.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:55.280]   If you try to love in your own strength, in your own flesh, you will become bitter.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.840]   And you've tried that probably, right?
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.800]   Try to love a mom or a dad who's very difficult to love in your own strength.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.040]   Try to love a friend who just makes silly decisions in your own strength.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:14.840]   You're going to be like, "Ah," and then you have to take a breath.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:21.480]   But when you are so free in the love of God, you can love other people without any expectations
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.240]   on their life.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:30.280]   I'm also reminded that the Word of God really is life.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:36.000]   It gives me wisdom.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.960]   It gives me insight into how I'm supposed to conduct myself day to day.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:53.280]   And it teaches me that my objective in this life is to represent the love of God, to know
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:57.240]   Him, to make Him known.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:05.040]   So how important is the Word of God to you is my question.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.640]   Four soils.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.400]   First one, they don't get it.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   They don't understand it.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   It's beyond them.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.680]   Satan takes it away.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.000]   Second soil, ooh, that looks nice.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.280]   But guess what happens?
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.280]   Persecution comes.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   Temptations come.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.440]   And the sun shines on it, it blazes, and the fruit is gone.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:30.880]   Third kind of soil, the wealthâ€”sorry, worries of life, riches, pleasures, chokes out the
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.200]   Word.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:38.300]   You know the more you indulge in entertainment, does it cause you to want God more or does
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.720]   it cause you to slip more and more every day?
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.040]   You guys know the answer to that.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:49.120]   You guys probably live it almost just regularly because I do.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.840]   But the more you turn away your thoughts from just mindlessly entertaining yourself, the
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.080]   more you will start to be desperate for God and you start getting into a habit of feeding
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.220]   that hunger, it turns into fruit.
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.520]   It turns into power.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.760]   It turns into insight.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.920]   The strangest thing, I text my former boss at Compassion.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.200]   I'm praying for her, "Hey, for some reason I feel like you're stressed.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.200]   Are you doing okay?"
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   And she was at the hospital when she got that text.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.080]   She's like, "How in the world did you know that?
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   I don't know.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.400]   I justâ€”you came into my mind."
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:28.520]   My thoughts are, when they're focused on God, He brings me people to reach out to.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:33.120]   It's a strange thing how that works.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.840]   But when I'm focused on entertaining myself, I think of how to hide so I can entertain
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.340]   myself more without distraction.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:47.260]   I told Becky, "You know how you could tell how spiritually well I'm doing or not?
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:53.300]   If I'm in the toilet more than 10 minutes, I'm not doing well.
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:57.920]   I mean, unless I'm really not doing well, okay?
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:02.800]   If I'm in the bathroom, I'm hiding from the kids.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:10.720]   I'm hiding from you so I could read what I want to watch, read, watch, play, whatever.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.280]   But if I'm in and out, then you know I'm actuallyâ€”my heart's right."
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:22.540]   So she was like, "That's the strangest test anyone has everâ€”" But I gauge it that way.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:28.280]   I like sports, but I've weaned myself off it where I'm not really that interested because
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.200]   a lot of times they get my hopes up, "Who's being traded to the Lakers?"
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   And it doesn't happen.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.600]   I get so discouraged.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:40.080]   But my heart, especially over the last several weeks, it's just, "God, every moment I'm
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.520]   awake, I want to think about your Word."
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.000]   So this morning, I popped up and I was like, "Okay, Genesis 127, God created man in his
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.200]   own image and in the image of God, He created him.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.280]   Male and female created them.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:55.860]   Genesis 218, then the Lord God said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:57.140]   I will make a helpful shooter for him.'
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.620]   Genesis 3-4, the serpent said to the woman, 'You surely will not die.'
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:06.520]   Genesis 3-15, 'I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.740]   He shall bruise you on the head and you shall bruise him on the heel.'"
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:15.420]   So I'm going through the index cards in this one box that I have, and it's just going.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:20.500]   And it continued while I was on that chair praying for you guys, and I just stopped praying
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.520]   after a couple minutes, and then I just started continuing on.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:32.020]   And I was in Haggai 1-3, and I feel so free and happy because I'm just constantly letting
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.940]   the Word of God just run through my head.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.460]   And I feel blessed.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.400]   And I'm claiming the promise of Psalm 1, "Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.580]   of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sinners, he who sees the mockers, what's
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:44.580]   his delight?"
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:50.540]   His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.020]   That's why I feel so free.
[00:59:54.020 --> 01:00:05.900]   And my encouragement to you guys is plant and drink deeply from His Word, and you're
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:12.060]   not going to worry about drifting.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:19.180]   Because when you're not doing well, you wonder where that line is, right?
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.900]   How far do I have to go before I can't come back?
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:27.180]   How far is this before it actually becomes sin?
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:33.260]   You stop asking that question when you're just delighting in God.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:42.020]   But when you are not in His Word but you're indulging in the flesh, you're worried.
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.020]   Am I drifting?
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.020]   Am I the second soil?
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:47.100]   Am I the third soil?
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.740]   So I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.740]   I'm a sinner.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.260]   I have lots of sins.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.660]   I am immature.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.140]   I am weak.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.580]   I am not trustworthy.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.500]   But one thing I can tell you, God is good.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.620]   Christ is good.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:08.460]   His Word is sweet, and He's changing me little by little every day because He's changing
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.860]   my thoughts.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:18.820]   The best way to keep from drifting is not to try not to drift.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:26.660]   The best way to not drift is just to obsess at the anchor.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.900]   Watch this if you understand this.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:36.700]   If all you want is Christ, drifting is never going to be an issue.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:43.700]   If all you want is Christ, you will stumble and then you'll pop back up.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:53.020]   If all you want is Christ, over time you're going to want other people to want Christ
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.980]   just like you do.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:03.420]   But my challenge is every opportunity that you have, whether it's choosing the Word of
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.420]   God or not, choose the Word of God.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:11.860]   And I guarantee it'll change you.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:20.860]   Every person that I've seen undertake an intense meditation on the Word of God does not come
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:24.800]   out pompous.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.420]   People who deeply meditate on theology, they can come out pompous.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.820]   If you are delighting in the Word of God, I've seen everybody who delights in the Word
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:43.140]   of God become gracious, become stable, become very loving.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.700]   And the reason I wanted to, I mean, I didn't know what the theme was, but I figured, you
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.940]   know, it'd be good if I spoke at our retreat because then, like, you know, guest speakers,
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:55.820]   it's easy because you can go and preach whatever you want and then you're done.
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.380]   But I wanted to do this first one and I never want to do this again because it's making,
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.660]   it's hard for me to really enjoy this retreat, okay?
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:09.840]   It's so that after we share and examine God's Word together, I'm still with you.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.300]   So if there is a desire in your heart to enjoy His Word, to know His Word, to study His Word,
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:20.520]   scrutinize His Word, I will not say no to try to help you.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.780]   And I will connect you to other people who have those same interests because it is not
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.460]   Pastor Peter, Kim, Mark, Nate, or me that you need to follow.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.860]   It is Christ.
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.180]   Amen?
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.980]   We can and may and will fail you.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.100]   His Word will not.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:45.740]   All we are are people trying to hold on to you and follow Christ.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:50.800]   But you need to attach to His Word before you attach to the pastors.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.340]   Don't use your pastors as your source of main feeding.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.760]   You guys follow me?
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:05.180]   But if as you're feeding off of the Word of God and you just want help, you want extra
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.420]   challenges, "Ooh, James, I'm almost done.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.940]   Ooh, give me another one."
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:13.240]   Okay, then Colossians, "Ooh."
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.760]   And you know one thing, just as a bonus, I remember almost every sermon that I've heard
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:24.120]   at Berean since March 18th when I first got back.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   Because every passage that Pastor Peter has preached out of, I either have memorized since
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:40.680]   or if I've already memorized that section, I memorize a reference verse that he quotes.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.140]   So Hebrews 1, I started memorizing Hebrews as Pastor Peter started the Hebrews.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.400]   I mean, I did all this in the NIV.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.840]   I have to switch all of it to the NASB.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.040]   It's a little bit interesting.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.480]   But that's what I'm doing.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.560]   "God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.480]   ways, in these last days He has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.840]   things and through whom He made the world.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.320]   And He is a radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature and upholds
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:12.560]   all things by the word of His power when He had made purification of sins."
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.040]   He sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.640]   I'm memorizing through Colossians 1.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.120]   And it's just running through my head all day.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.640]   So Wednesday night Bible study, guess what happens when I'm ready to study it?
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.640]   I'm excited.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   I'm pumped.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   I'm, "Ooh, verse 24.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   What do we do with this?"
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.640]   Right?
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.760]   What is lacking in Christ's afflictions?
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.160]   And then after Pastor Peter shared, I thought, "Oh, that's a great way to remember."
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.240]   So I memorized Philippians 2.30 and memorized Romans chapter 10, verse 14.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.440]   Because he talked about how then will they call on the one whom they have not believed?
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.040]   How will they believe on Him who they have not heard?
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.840]   How will they hear without a preacher?
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   That is filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.160]   Ooh, good to know.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.000]   I just memorized it.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.540]   The more you invest into the word of God, it's not going to make you arrogant or pompous
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.440]   or just haughty.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.080]   It's going to make you fruitful.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.040]   Isn't that what the Bible promises?
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.480]   Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:18.080]   And my challenge to you is start cutting out things that you don't even really fully enjoy,
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.220]   but now you're just addicted to, and turn your attention to the word.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:28.600]   If you turn off TV and just sit there in the room, you're going to watch TV again.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:37.000]   Your brain needs to be, your affections need to transfer themselves from this to this.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.120]   And that, your pastors are more than happy to help you with.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.120]   How do you bear fruit?
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.720]   How do you become the soil that 30, 60, 90, 100 fold?
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.660]   What's the secret ingredient?
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:07:01.560]   His word, working through the indwelling of His spirit in the soil of your heart.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.360]   And without you even knowing it, you're building on the solid rock of Christ.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:11.080]   You guys follow me?
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   Start somewhere.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:19.800]   Because if you don't, you're going to keep wandering and perhaps even drifting away.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.100]   And then tonight we're going to be talking about how we help each other do that and how
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.920]   we pursue freedom in Christ.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   Let's pray together.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:40.380]   Lord, we pray that you would help us.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.540]   Know the truth.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:47.520]   We know that the truth will set us free.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.300]   Free from the slavery and bondage to our addictions and our cravings and our sins.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.580]   Free from fear of condemnation.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.780]   Fear for our freedom from bitterness.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:06.540]   And we know, Lord God, that you will free us to love one another and to serve you.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:14.220]   Help us to feed off your word and would your word bear much fruit in our lives?
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:23.140]   Help us truly be a Berean community where we examine your word carefully and we obsess
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.140]   over it.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.440]   We scrutinize it.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.780]   And as we do so, Lord, that you would grow and mature us.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.780]   You would sanctify us.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.800]   And you would bear fruit through us.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.960]   your glory. I pray these things in Jesus' name.
