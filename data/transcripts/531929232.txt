[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   Okay.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:21.000]   As we continue to reflect upon this week and just again, the various aspects of what Christ
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.440]   has accomplished, we're so thankful for everything that Christ has done.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.020]   Thank you Adam for sharing how the Lord has been good to you with us.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.720]   At this time, let's take a moment to turn in our Bibles to Matthew chapter 26, verses
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.320]   14 through 19.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   Matthew 26, verses 14 through 19.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:55.360]   Today is called Silent Wednesday and here we see a narrative of what Judas did during
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.360]   this day.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.800]   Let's take a moment to read this passage, Matthew 16, verses 14 through 19.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.400]   And it says, "Then one of the twelve named Judas Iscariot went to the chief priest and
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.680]   said, 'What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?'
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.200]   And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.300]   From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.160]   Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, 'Where
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.360]   do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?'
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.720]   And he said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher says, 'My
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.360]   time is near.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.160]   I am to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.760]   The disciples did as Jesus had directed them and they prepared the Passover."
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.960]   Real briefly, I want to review the various events of the Passion Week using the graphic
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.720]   that our media team shared.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.000]   That on Saturday of the week, they came to Bethany and they stayed over at Mary, Martha
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   and Lazarus' house.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.640]   And the thing about it is, by this time, anywhere Jesus went, there was already a crowd.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.560]   There was already a massive crowd and because Lazarus had been raised from the dead, there
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.600]   is just this massive amount of people that are trying to always see Jesus.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.640]   That always upset the Pharisees and the religious leaders of the day.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.000]   On Sunday, Jesus enters into Jerusalem and saying there is masses of people is an understatement.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.920]   There are hordes of people praising him with palm branches saying, "Hosanna, Hosanna,"
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.720]   which essentially means, "Save us, save us, O son of David."
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.760]   And so, that also upset the religious leaders of the time to the degree they were commanding
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.520]   Jesus, "Make them stop."
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.500]   And then on Monday, Jesus went into the temple and cleared it, disrupting the corrupt economy
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.160]   of the temple, essentially marketplace.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.520]   That sure upset the religious leaders of the time.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.620]   Just like we reviewed yesterday, Jesus went head to head in heated debates, saying parables
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.400]   and describing specific depictions and the Pharisees and the religious leaders knew that
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.620]   Jesus was talking about them.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.880]   And so, that upset the religious leaders even more.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.440]   Essentially, what we see as things are developing is there is a ramping up of the hatred of
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.320]   Christ and Pastor Nate eloquently said yesterday night that there was murderous intent by this
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   time.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.560]   Already, they wanted him to either be quiet, be disproved, or completely thrown off or
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.000]   seen as a fake, but by this time, they just wanted to eliminate him.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.160]   And what you have essentially, Judas, I think that Judas was one that was paying attention
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.440]   to all that was going on.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.080]   You see, perhaps some of the other disciples, maybe Peter might have been thinking, "Yeah,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.600]   Jesus, you stick to him," right?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.960]   Because there are a lot of Jews who wanted Jesus to be a revolutionary.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.520]   And perhaps there was a lot of people who were already in the community had angst towards
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.040]   the already established system.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.560]   Clearly, they had angst towards the ruling power, right?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.000]   Maybe the sons of thunder, right?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.680]   They're like, "Yeah, bring it down."
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   Every time he went head to head in a debate, maybe they were just sitting there pumping
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.640]   their fists and going, "Ooh, that's right, burn," you know?
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.680]   And they were just egging him on.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.200]   I think perhaps Judas was sitting there like this crazy guy.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   He told us he was going to die, but look at him, flipping tables, challenging the authorities.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   These high priests, these scribes, these Pharisees and Sadducees, they had temple officers.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.560]   They had security guards.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.720]   They had soldiers of their own.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.240]   A lot of times, they enacted capital punishment when they felt that certain crimes fit the
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   bill.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.600]   Judas is sitting here like, "This guy is nuts.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   He's probably going to die."
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.040]   Why?
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.600]   Because sometimes, mistakenly, people say the disciples didn't really get it.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.400]   They didn't really know that Jesus was going to go to the cross.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.680]   No, actually, starting from Matthew 16, and even prior to then, Jesus was already both
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.120]   hinting and then explicitly told them, "I am going to suffer."
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.160]   For example, Matthew 16, 21 through 22 says, "From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things from the elders and chief priests,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.800]   and be killed and be raised up on the third day.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.760]   That's when Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'God forbid it.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.960]   Lord, this shall never happen to you.'"
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.620]   The disciples knew, they just didn't like the idea.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.680]   Another example, Matthew 17, 22, 23, "And while they were gathering together in Galilee,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.440]   Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.080]   they will kill him.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.160]   He will be raised on the third day.'
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.760]   And they were deeply grieved."
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.400]   So fact.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.720]   Not only in these instances, but you can count about five instances where Jesus was explicitly
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.160]   clear.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.320]   Prior to that, Jesus also hinted, "The Son of Man must be lifted.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.560]   Son of Man must suffer."
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.200]   There were enough pre-disclosures, so to speak, that the disciples should have known if they
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.320]   were paying attention.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.680]   But the fact of the matter is, they were just wondering, "Huh?
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360]   Is that a good idea?"
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.720]   They just didn't like it.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.800]   Judas essentially then understood Jesus' statements.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.060]   He understood, you know, point 1A.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.220]   He just did not also understand point 1B.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:38.120]   In his eyes, he was thinking, "Oh my goodness, this rabbi of ours, this lord and master of
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.800]   ours is going to get us killed."
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.720]   It's probably what he was thinking.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.280]   Jesus is going to get himself killed and us along with him.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   I believe Judas was a calculating man.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.820]   He was the individual who was taking care of the money bag for the group.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.600]   He was the man, do you remember, when the lady came, broke the alabaster, and was anointing
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   Jesus?
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.760]   And Judas said, "What a waste!
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.240]   You know that could have been sold?"
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.920]   For the poor, of course, right?
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.680]   He was a quick calculating man who understood Jesus was going to get himself killed.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.760]   And so, as an opportunist, he decides to get in on the game.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.440]   If Jesus is going to be killed by the Pharisees, then at least I'm going to benefit from it.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.840]   What I found very interesting was that I just always assumed that the scribes and Pharisees
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.200]   were looking for an opportunity to kill Jesus, so they kind of egged on one of the disciples,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   right?
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.840]   Maybe one of the Pharisees came along and said, "Come here.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.600]   Let me give you some money," or something like that.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.360]   Some deal went down.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.280]   After reviewing the details of this passage, notice how in this passage in Matthew 26,
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.920]   verse 14, it says that Judas actually went and asked this question of them, "What are
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.400]   you willing to give me?"
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.080]   And Judas at this point didn't even have a plan yet.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.000]   But what he was doing was he was working with both the Pharisees and the temple officers,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.120]   those soldiers I was talking about, to devise a plan from that time.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.240]   And I thought this was really interesting because at that moment then, Judas didn't
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.880]   even have everything planned out.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:24.320]   And as a matter of fact, he, in my eyes, didn't even add that much to the plan.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.940]   Do you ever think about that?
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.440]   What did Judas add to the plan of betraying Christ?
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.160]   I mean, you could readily see where Jesus was.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.880]   There was a crowd following him.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.760]   And then I realized this is the only thing, essentially, Judas was adding to the betrayal
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.980]   and the scheme.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:48.600]   The Pharisees, because of their fear of man, wanted to find Jesus in a secluded moment.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.840]   They wanted to avoid the crowds.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.900]   And so, here in this passage, if you take a look in Luke 22, verse 3 through 6, it says,
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.620]   "Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.820]   And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.820]   to them.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.100]   They were glad and agreed with him money.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:16.540]   So he consented and began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd."
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.820]   Do you see that?
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.100]   I'm highlighting these aspects of the story because we're taking a look at Judas and his
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.100]   perspective.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:32.460]   And to me, what's really interesting about all this is there was such a greed in Judas'
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.300]   heart that I believe Satan seized that, entered into him, and played on him.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:43.480]   Now just as a quick side note, the story is quite crazy because we recognize that everything
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.300]   that is happening is absolutely according to the timetable of God.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.460]   God is so sovereign that everything is falling into place and the Scripture is being fulfilled.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:10:01.320]   Nevertheless, Satan is also entering into Judas, fulfilling his schemes and his devices.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.940]   But also, Judas himself is a foolish, greedy man, seizing the opportunity.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.420]   You see everything in play.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:18.100]   And what Judas is doing is he is trying to, I think, make up perhaps for some lost time.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.980]   If Jesus is going to go out, at least I'm going to recoup a little bit of money.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.460]   What's really crazy about this is the passage in Matthew says that they offer, when he asked,
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.460]   "How much will you give me?"
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.880]   They offered 30 pieces of silver.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.500]   When I reviewed that, I was like, "Wait a minute.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.020]   It's not even gold, right?
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.220]   This guy's nuts."
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.480]   Thirty pieces of silver in that time would be worth about five weeks' wage, they say.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   It's a month wage.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:53.540]   A Lord, a rabbi, a master, even to this individual, walking with him for three years, and yet
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.780]   for a single month's wage, he'd be willing to say, "Deal.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.520]   I consent."
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.280]   This is a greedy individual.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.980]   And what I like to say this, when an individual gives into one's greed, it makes the individual
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.760]   absolutely foolish.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.620]   The plan is so foolish, Jesus himself calls it foolish.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.880]   The plan is so foolish, when you read it, you kind of wonder, truly, Judas didn't even
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.980]   add much to the entire scheme of things.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.780]   As a matter of fact, in this passage I want to highlight for you in Matthew 26, verse
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.180]   55 through 56, it says, "At that time, Jesus said to the crowds who had gathered," so this,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.140]   right now, what I'm reading is when the people actually try to come and seize Jesus.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.180]   He asked this question, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as you
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.220]   would against a robber?
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.340]   Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.300]   But all this has taken place to fulfill the scriptures of the prophets.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.420]   Then all the disciples left him and fled."
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.740]   Jesus is essentially saying, "This is dumb.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.420]   I was with you every single day.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.100]   You had to scheme, trying to catch me."
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.980]   And then the funny thing about it is they're trying to avoid a crowd, but there was already
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.980]   a crowd.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.460]   Jesus was speaking to the crowd there.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:15.660]   But essentially, when I think about this, I think about as a reflection and meditation,
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.200]   there is such a greed in Judas' heart that we can reflect on.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:29.180]   To ask the question, if we are tempted with this, I guess, expectation of what is Jesus
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:36.500]   going to avail to me, what kind of benefit, or perhaps if Satan would tempt us with this
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.460]   kind of complaint, this is a waste of time.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:48.380]   Or perhaps the angst and frustration that perhaps we live in this day, where Satan puts
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.920]   these foolish words into our head, where we start to complain and say, "I'm tired of living
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.340]   paycheck to paycheck.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.260]   I'm tired of going town to town.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.680]   I'm tired of asking.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:04.080]   I'm tired of going through the village and having to pick up the leftover grain."
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.320]   Those kinds of sentiments, what does that reveal?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:15.580]   I think those kind of sentiments are the sentiments essentially pervasive in this generation.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.020]   And so I want to give you this question.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.300]   When Judas is tempted with this betrayal, this disloyalty, I wonder if his reason and
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:32.540]   rationale for him following Jesus in the first place is actually the exact same reason why
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.660]   he is betraying him now.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.420]   If Judas thought like the rest of the disciples, "Hey, Jesus, look at you.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.020]   Look at the crowds on our side.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.020]   Look at all the people.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.160]   You've got number on your side.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.100]   So now tell us who's going to be on your right and left."
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.260]   I'm pretty sure Judas was also listening.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:58.660]   "Yes, Jesus, tell us who is going to be on your right and left."
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:04.300]   And so what's really interesting about this is with Judas' greed and his looking to Christ
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:11.380]   for some kind of benefit, even if at least you're going to gain me this 30 shekels, 30
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.300]   silver, I mean, that is a horrible, horrible sentiment.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.020]   But what I liken it to is somebody who has Jesus in their garage.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.540]   What do I mean?
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.540]   I believe one of the grave sins of this generation is a lot of time people like holding onto
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:34.580]   Christ as something of value, valuable enough that I can't throw him away.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.980]   They'll like to have him in his garage just in case we need him, but when the opportune
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:45.220]   time comes, we might have a garage sale because at least if I sell it, then I'll have some
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.900]   money.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.620]   What's really crazy about all this, again, is we can reflect on lots of different things.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.940]   Oh my gosh, incredible amounts of vanity that Judas would walk with Jesus for so long and
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.140]   be able to betray him in that moment.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.500]   But in the end, when greed takes control of the heart, we will do all kinds of heinous
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.820]   things.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.380]   And so as a reflection and challenge to us, I want to ask you, do you have any of these
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.900]   discontent, disappointed sentiments, perhaps even a grumbling complaint against Christ?
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.300]   "Lord, what have you done for me though?
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.980]   Why aren't you helping me though?"
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.140]   If that is the case, we have to be very careful, amen?
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.620]   Now what I would like to highlight by way of closing thought is not so much Judas because
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:39.900]   there is still nevertheless Jesus who is exhibiting incredible amounts of composure.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:45.460]   What I'm trying to say is today, although it is Silent Wednesday, let us not just simply
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.620]   think about Judas the sinner, the betrayer, one who is, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, it must have
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.740]   been better for you not to have been born because woe is the one who would betray the
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   son of God."
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:00.740]   But let's actually focus on the son of God who is to be appreciated for his incredible
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.180]   composure.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:08.740]   When I think about the events leading up to this week, I mean, I think about like Jesus
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.700]   knowing what he knows in terms of what is filled in the heart of man.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.980]   Jesus knew all along that there would be a betrayer.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.620]   Jesus knows when people are asking him questions, "Tell us, Jesus.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.380]   Show us a sign, Jesus."
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.100]   He knows what is contained in the heart of all those who would ask him and accuse him.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:33.980]   When he is walking into the city in Jerusalem, all these individuals praising him and giving
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.500]   him branches, he knows what's in their heart.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.860]   When he is debating, when he is engaged in all the teaching and the debates and the fierce
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:51.480]   combats with the scribes of the day, he knows what's in their hearts.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.740]   And while Judas thinks he's secretly going and making a deal, is Jesus not aware?
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.940]   Jesus is absolutely aware.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.740]   Tomorrow during the Passover, Jesus calls it out, "He whose hand is on the table with
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.540]   me will betray me."
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.260]   And all the disciples are like, "Dude, not me.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.260]   Not me."
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   Right?
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.540]   And he could have easily said, "And you will deny me and you will run and you will..."
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.240]   But the composure.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.100]   So when I reflect on the passages when Jesus says, "I did not come to judge," every single
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.500]   step of the way, I'm sitting there thinking, "Thank you, Lord, because if I were you, I
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.900]   would sit there and call out every single person.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900]   You liar.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   You two-faced."
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.900]   Right?
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:46.980]   And then even here, to be aware that Judas is doing this and then has the audacity come
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.700]   with the rest of the disciples to share in the meal where Jesus is instituting the new
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:59.020]   covenant and he's explaining to them, "This is my body broken, my blood shed for you."
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.460]   Can you imagine?
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.540]   I can't imagine that.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:08.500]   I can't imagine like sometimes you put yourself in the shoes thinking that this is the bread
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.180]   broken for you and you would just look and be like, "Not you."
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.180]   Right?
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.180]   And then you just move on.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.460]   We thank the Lord.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:25.540]   Lord, thank you that you did not come first to judge, but you came first to show mercy.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.660]   And so scripture talks about the greatness of Christ.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.340]   First Peter chapter 2, verse 21 through 24, it says, "For you have been called for this
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.260]   purpose since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.580]   his steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.500]   While being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.300]   While suffering, he uttered no threats."
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.900]   And then I would add, "While being betrayed."
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   Right?
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:01.500]   "While being betrayed, he did not react, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.060]   righteously.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.980]   And he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sin and
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.600]   live to righteousness.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.260]   For by his wounds, you were healed."
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.260]   Amen.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:22.580]   Let us continue to reflect and recognize when Christ entered into that scene and was going
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:29.780]   to the cross, the scene is horrific because there's just so much corruption, waywardness,
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.160]   and sin around him.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.300]   And what would feel natural if you put yourself in his shoes would be, "You should just judge
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.700]   all of them right now."
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:45.020]   And so we praise Christ and we pray in appreciation.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.640]   What great composure, what great dedication to fulfill your merciful, saving grace.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.780]   Let's take time now to pray.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.520]   Would you take a moment to examine your heart?
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.660]   Is there any greedy expectation?
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.860]   Is there any grumbling complaint upon Christ, disappointment in your heart?
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:11.020]   But also let's quickly turn that around to say to the Lord, "God, we appreciate every
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.080]   aspect of what you've done, even making sure that you walk through all of these necessary
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.340]   steps so that the scripture would be fulfilled, but that your mercy would be fulfilled upon
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.340]   the cross."
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.420]   Let's take some time to pray.
