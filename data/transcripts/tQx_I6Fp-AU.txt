[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.240]   All right.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.640]   So first of all, we have, again, we have three services
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.400]   and those of you who are desiring to come
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.800]   and you're on the waiting list and you couldn't get in,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.960]   please let us know because we do have space
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   and so we can fill you in.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.400]   So email Pastor Mark and let him know.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.180]   And there is a place to sign up online
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.280]   so they'll be able to get the message
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.200]   and then get you into one of the services, okay?
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.560]   So please do that ahead of time.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.160]   And what's the other one that I was supposed to say?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.120]   Somebody has three legs.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   What does this mean?
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.800]   Membership, okay, so it's an M, not three legs, okay.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.640]   All right, so membership.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.360]   Okay, so starting from the first week of July,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.960]   we have our new membership class.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   Before we used to have membership and church introduction,
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.680]   foundational Christian doctrine all in one class.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.640]   But starting from July, the first week of July,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.420]   July 7th, I believe, right?
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.960]   July 5th, okay, so July 5th, the first Sunday of July,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.600]   we're gonna start a new membership class.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.160]   It's gonna go for about an hour and a half for eight weeks
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.580]   instead of one hour class for 10 weeks.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.620]   So it's actually, time-wise, it's longer,
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.280]   but the days is shortened.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.160]   And it's gonna be strictly for membership.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.600]   So there is going to be a separate class
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.780]   for people who wanna learn about Christianity
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.720]   and ask different questions about that.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.400]   But now it's going to be specific for membership
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.860]   'cause we wanna dive a little bit deeper
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.180]   into some of the things that we wanna talk about
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.240]   and make sure that we properly prepare people
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.520]   for membership and so just keep that in mind.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.520]   So July 5th is when the beginning of that will be.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.800]   So if you need to do that, please sign up with Pastor Mark
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.960]   and it will be taking place during the second service,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.840]   at 1030 service, at the cafeteria area.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.360]   And so we wanna do that because there's more space there
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.260]   so people can kinda spread out, all right?
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.440]   So if you have any questions about that,
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.360]   please let Pastor Mark know or email
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.060]   and then he'll give you more information, okay?
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.400]   All right, again, I apologize, kids.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.520]   I'll make sure that I get to you next week.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.000]   And those of you who are extra good
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   and you are waiting, sorry, parents, I failed today.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.560]   I'll make sure I drink plenty of coffee
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.640]   so this doesn't happen next time, all right?
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.520]   So let me pray for us and just kinda,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.280]   to let you know those who are here,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.120]   the physical offering, if you choose to do so,
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.000]   there is an offering box in the back.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.080]   As you're going out, you can give it there.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.720]   So our offering, for the sake of not passing out
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.920]   the offering baskets, we're not gonna be doing that
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.880]   for a while and most of you who've gotten the habit
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.120]   of giving online and you wanna continue to do that,
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.240]   so during the offering time, just do that.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.480]   We'll give you about 15, 20 seconds to do that
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.280]   and then the others of you who wanna bring
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.160]   a physical check, that can be done in the back, okay?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.240]   So let me pray for us and then pray for the offering
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.640]   and then our worship team will begin to lead us.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.400]   Heavenly Father, we praise you
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.000]   and thank you for your goodness.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.120]   Thank you so much, Lord God, for allowing us
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.600]   to open up the church again.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.320]   And even though it's not ideal
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.800]   and it's not exactly what we want,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.640]   but we thank you, Father God, that we're able to gather
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.920]   and we pray that the coming weeks, coming months,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.480]   that we'd be able to come together, all of us, Lord God,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.240]   that we may fellowship, that we may love,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.720]   we may practice the things that you teach us.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.080]   And I pray, Father God, that through all of this,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.760]   that it would cause us to love the church
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.320]   that you sent your son to die for even more.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.160]   We pray that you would bless this morning, Lord God,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.120]   as we worship you.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.880]   Help us to do it in spirit and in truth,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.400]   that even in our giving, help us to be intentional,
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.040]   help us, Lord God, to be generous,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.600]   help us to give joyfully, that it may be multiplied
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.320]   for your use in your kingdom.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.080]   (gentle piano music)
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.920]  ,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:40.960]   I'm gonna have you stand now.

[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.280]   in where you are and worship with us.

[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:31.700]   - You know, I did remember one person's birthday.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.140]   Okay, Hanami, all the way from Japan,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.820]   is celebrating her birthday today.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.060]   So, happy birthday.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.540]   Okay, everybody else, forgive me,
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.900]   I'll get back to you next week, okay?
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.980]   If you can turn to Hebrews,
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.980]   and I know some of you guys who are on the Facebook,
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.100]   you saw me changing the name of the title
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.100]   of the sermon this morning, "No Justice, No Peace."
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.980]   And I know some of you probably saw that change
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.780]   and thought, finally,
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.020]   he's addressing what's going on.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.180]   Okay, and some of you guys may have said that,
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.580]   maybe some of you look at this symbol of this fist,
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.900]   and that symbol alone kind of triggers bad thoughts.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.580]   Okay, and so, what is going on?
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.380]   Well, all over the country, maybe even all over the world,
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.900]   right now people are protesting and saying,
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.720]   "No justice, no peace."
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.740]   And that little phrase is something
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.020]   that's been around for many decades.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.360]   And I actually did a study to find out where it started,
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.500]   and no one knows for sure.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.940]   Some think that it started maybe
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.340]   during the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.020]   Some people think that it may have started
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.860]   sometime in the '70s after the Vietnam War,
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.140]   during the protest at "No Justice, No Peace."
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.100]   Now, we don't know exactly where it started,
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.580]   but what we do know is that the idea
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.980]   behind "No Justice, No Peace" is rooted in Scripture.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.100]   In fact, the very foundations upon the gospel
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.980]   in which we celebrate and sing about
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.020]   is at the core, "No justice, no peace."
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.300]   In fact, all throughout the Old Testament,
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.980]   God is establishing the necessity of justice.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.460]   And as the Jews were looking for the shalom, for peace,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.420]   and they would greet each other for peace,
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.620]   God was establishing that the only way
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.400]   that peace was gonna come about
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.520]   is if God brings back justice, righteousness.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.340]   So at the core of the gospel message is this message,
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.820]   there is no justice, there is no peace.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.460]   But here's our dilemma.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.340]   Who's justice?
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.440]   And what kind of peace are we looking for?
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.140]   If we look from the black communities,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.600]   and again, obviously black community
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.000]   are not the only people who experience racism.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.140]   You don't have to be a particular race
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.640]   to know what racism is.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.740]   You can be a Caucasian in America and experience racism.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.580]   But the black community in particular,
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.700]   and I think it's important for us to acknowledge their pain.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.660]   No other group of people,
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.340]   yes, there are Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans,
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.100]   there are Native Americans,
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.340]   and various other groups of people
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.480]   who have experienced tremendous racism.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.460]   But the African Americans, their history is slavery.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.900]   They were brought here by force hundreds of years ago
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.880]   with forced labor.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.140]   And so even though that was many, many generations ago,
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:40.580]   racism was blatant even up to the 1960s.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.420]   And so you have a community of people
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.100]   where there is deep-rooted bitterness and even hatred
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.280]   that is underlying what they remember,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.260]   what their history is.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.020]   So to simply say to get over it
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:58.020]   is not only too simplistic, but is highly insensitive.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:06.260]   They are more sensitive to what seems to be racism.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.180]   Even if objectively we may look at it and say,
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.380]   "How is that racism?"
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.700]   They are more sensitive to racism, understandably.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.120]   Just like if somebody was abused,
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.660]   they are more sensitive to abuse.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.900]   If somebody has grown up in an abusive home,
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.100]   and what may seem like abuse,
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.100]   they are going to, whenever that gets triggered,
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.620]   their emotions get triggered,
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.800]   all of their past experiences, all their grandparents,
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.820]   and all their past history are all going to come into play
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.200]   in how they view that particular situation.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.420]   In fact, I remember, I told you,
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.620]   I have personal experience in racism,
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.420]   but I had a friend back in junior high school,
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.920]   and we went to school in the Valley.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.860]   He was so sensitive to racism because he didn't,
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.780]   I came to the United States when I was really young,
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.280]   so my English was fine, but he came a little bit later.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.420]   He came almost at the end of elementary school,
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.700]   so he had a thick accent.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.460]   And so, obviously, people targeted him,
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.860]   you dumb chink, dumb chink,
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.380]   but he was not a small guy like me, he was a big guy.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.420]   And so he was so hypersensitive.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.500]   I remember walking down the hall one time,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.420]   and we heard something at the end of the hall,
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.940]   and he went running, and then he started railing on some kid
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.060]   and I had to pull him off, and we're walking out of school,
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.660]   and I said, "What happened?"
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.140]   He said, "He said something about Ching Chung something,
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.860]   "and he heard it at the end of the hallway,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.200]   "and I don't even know if that's what actually happened.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.300]   "He may have dropped something,
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.780]   "he may have made it sound like Ching Chung or something."
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.820]   But he was so sensitive.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.940]   Anything that sounded like racism, he ran over there,
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.860]   because he was constantly walking in rage.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.700]   So to a certain extent, it's understandable
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.220]   that there is hypersensitivity.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.500]   And I think it is insensitive and not right
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.780]   for us to not to acknowledge that, that there is that.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.840]   And the anger toward the politicians in particular,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.300]   and to the police,
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.220]   because they represent the power structure.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.500]   And that's where they've experienced racism,
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.540]   even if it's not personal, at least historically.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.180]   So for us to completely nullify that,
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.300]   again, it's beyond insensitive,
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.580]   and I think that's something that Christians
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.500]   should be sensitive about and pay attention to.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.100]   But we also need to acknowledge
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.540]   from the other point of view.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.440]   Our police officers, right now there's a movement
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.880]   to defund the police, the police are evil.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.820]   Imagine if you're a police officer,
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.820]   and you have taken an oath to serve and to protect.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.620]   And your job is to go out there
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.380]   and risking your health and your life to help other people.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.820]   And because of a few acts of certain police officers,
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:00.140]   a small percentage of them, have abused their power,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.100]   that what the hatred going toward the police
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.640]   also seems very racist.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.280]   A broad stroke toward every officer
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.160]   that has been trying to do their job.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.420]   In fact, think about this perspective.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.760]   Not that many years ago, after 9/11,
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.320]   the two planes hit the Twin Towers.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.980]   While thousands of people were running away
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.280]   from that building because of danger,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   police officers and firemen ran toward those buildings,
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.640]   and hundreds of them, in the context
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.660]   of trying to save these lives,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.900]   lost their lives when those buildings crumbled.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.760]   Some of you guys may not remember,
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.880]   you might have been too young,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.020]   but for several years after that,
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.840]   people would buy NYPD and NYF, right,
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.840]   fire department, uniforms and hats
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.320]   to celebrate the bravery of our police officers,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.800]   first responders.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.440]   They were the heroes of our society,
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.460]   not that many years ago, because they literally,
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.040]   their job is a calling to risk their lives,
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.480]   give their lives for the safety of other people.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.280]   So to be in that situation,
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.560]   and then just a few years later,
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.640]   to be demonized, saying that they are all racist,
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.560]   you can understand why it is very difficult
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.200]   for them to handle.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.740]   And you have the police officers
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.940]   and the people who are deeply hurt
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.340]   by the history of this country,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.880]   standing side by side, pushing each other,
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.760]   and why there is animosity
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   in these demonstrations is understandable.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.720]   Even the protesting of the flag,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.360]   you can see how the black community
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.000]   are taking the knee to protest
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.800]   what they view as injustice.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.440]   And then you can see the response from that,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.260]   in particular from veterans who went out to war,
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.020]   and for them, it's not just a symbol.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.800]   They lost their friends,
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.700]   people that they loved, that they walked with,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.000]   that they are going to remember
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.200]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.120]   So to them, disrespecting the flag
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.440]   is disrespecting their friend.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.800]   So you can imagine why there is an extreme response
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.320]   from kneeling from that community.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.920]   And we can also understand the heart behind
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.800]   why they may be protesting.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.960]   Again, whether you agree or don't agree,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   we can understand the heart behind that.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:32.560]   That slogan, "No justice, no peace,"
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.500]   it is rooted in the Bible.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.400]   But how do you practice this?
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.580]   Whose justice?
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:44.320]   Because what is justice to one community
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.560]   may be injustice to another community.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.260]   What may seem like justice to one group
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.660]   can easily be interpreted as injustice in another group.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.520]   So is justice in community
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.260]   simply based upon who has the power?
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.300]   So if the police and the government has power,
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.480]   they can do whatever they want
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.780]   and whatever they think is justice
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.680]   and treat people any way they want
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   because they have the power
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.440]   and whatever they view as justice.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.200]   If we have enough rioting and enough force
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.120]   and get enough people to get behind these protests
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.800]   and they can strong arm people
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.520]   and even get rid of the police station,
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.480]   is that justice?
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.880]   Whoever has power,
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.040]   how do we practice this?
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.080]   If it is at the root of the gospel
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.220]   that you and I profess and sing and believe in,
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.680]   how do we practice something
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.020]   that is so difficult to practice?
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.740]   I didn't change my sermon today.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.920]   It just happened that the topic of the sermon,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.720]   the text that we're looking at today,
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.520]   tells us that Jesus Christ is the king of righteousness
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.720]   and king of peace.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.540]   You know what's interesting
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.120]   is the word for righteousness, dikaios,
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.520]   in other parts of the Bible is translated justice.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.460]   It is the same word.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.560]   So in other words,
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.240]   this text tells us that Jesus is the king of justice
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.200]   and Jesus is the king of peace.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.560]   So again, I didn't jump into this text.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.180]   It just happened in God's sovereignty
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.440]   we landed on this text.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.800]   Hebrews chapter 7, 2B, this is what it says.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.400]   By the translation of his name,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.940]   king of righteousness, Melchizedek.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.500]   Melchi means the king, zedek, righteousness or justice.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.060]   His name means king of justice
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.400]   and then also king of Salem.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.360]   Salem is the Hebrew version of that is Shalom.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.360]   Many people think that Salem
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.480]   is the old ancient name of Jerusalem.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.920]   Jeru meaning city, Shalom meaning peace.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.600]   So he's the king of righteousness and the king of peace.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.880]   But if you notice here, the author,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.360]   if you don't pay attention,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.640]   there's a subtle but very important thing
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.980]   that he says here.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.240]   By the translation of his name, king of righteousness,
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.840]   and then also king of Salem, king of peace.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.680]   He puts that in order.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.300]   In other words, that's no different than saying
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.760]   no justice, no peace.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.480]   Because peace comes from righteousness.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.300]   Righteousness first and then peace.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.200]   If we don't establish righteousness,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.480]   there can be no peace.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.960]   Because peace without righteousness is anarchy.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.540]   Righteousness without peace is fascism.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.840]   Whoever has the power does whatever they want.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.320]   The whole purpose of why we study the Bible,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.000]   what the gospel is, why Jesus came and died
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.540]   and was resurrected and established his new kingdom,
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.280]   is so that by establishing righteousness,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.900]   by establishing justice, that he was going to bring peace.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.840]   In Psalm 85, nine through 10, it says,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.200]   "Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.940]   "that glory may dwell in our land,
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.900]   "loving kindness and truth met together,
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.580]   "righteousness and peace have kissed each other."
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.300]   In description of the kingdom that Christ
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.940]   was going to bring, he says that righteousness
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.600]   and peace are going to have perfect harmony.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.100]   They're gonna kiss each other.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:09.300]   See, at the root of who Jesus is,
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.100]   king of justice, king of righteousness.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:19.120]   See, it is very, very difficult for us to practice justice.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.900]   Because, for four reasons.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.300]   One, the way we see justice, we see it
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.280]   from our point of view.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.620]   And there's no human being that is not biased that way.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.820]   Every single person is biased that way.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.540]   The longer that I live, the more I become biased.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.440]   Because of my past experience.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.540]   Certain things that I've experienced,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.420]   certain things that I've read, it causes me to be biased.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.180]   Because when I run into somebody,
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.660]   or I get into a certain situation,
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.940]   I remember the previous situation.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.820]   I remember the previous experience.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.460]   And so I don't start neutral.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.260]   I start with wherever I left off.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.400]   And every single human being is biased to a certain degree.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.640]   You know, when you're a child, if you've raised children,
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.060]   or every single one of us were children at one point,
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.420]   and I think you all know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.720]   You hear the term, it's not fair.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.120]   What is fair?
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.180]   Usually what we consider fair really starts with us.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.380]   I remember when our kids were young,
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.180]   you know, in order to take them to Disneyland,
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.920]   and again, you guys know how much I love being at Disneyland.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.540]   We did it for the kids.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.060]   Spent all day sacrificing,
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.260]   literally carrying our cross for the kids.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.620]   And at the end of the day, we're going home,
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.320]   thinking, oh, let's get some Jamba Juice, you know?
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.900]   And we stop over, get some Jamba Juice.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.540]   But then they didn't get quite the flavor that they wanted,
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.360]   or we had to split the cup in half,
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.380]   and the other kid got a little bit more than the other.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.820]   And the rest of the ride from Jamba Juice home was,
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.160]   it's not fair.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.100]   Now as a parent, I wanna pull over
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.860]   and get everybody to leave, walk home, okay?
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.860]   I've literally, you know, spent all day in the hot sun,
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.940]   paying money I didn't wanna pay,
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.540]   in a place I didn't wanna be.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.160]   Mickey Mouse in my face, all day long.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.260]   And because you didn't get what you wanted, it's not fair.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.140]   Now, we're not kids.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:20.900]   We're a lot more sophisticated than that.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.060]   But we say that in our hearts all the time.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.500]   When we don't get what we want,
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.940]   God doesn't answer our prayers,
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.860]   or when people say certain things,
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.020]   we say in our hearts, it's not fair.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.860]   I've heard a lot of people say,
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.820]   "I didn't get a stimulus check."
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.080]   Maybe, what happened?
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.260]   What did you do to earn that stimulus check?
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.580]   But I've heard a lot of people say, "It's not fair."
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.220]   You know, Jesus has a parable about that in the Bible,
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.840]   in Matthew chapter 20, one through 16.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.700]   The parable of the laborers,
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.020]   where he promised a certain amount of money,
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.620]   but certain people went in at different parts of the day,
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.140]   and then a guy got it at the very last hour,
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.460]   and he got paid the same thing,
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.420]   and the rest of the workers who worked all day say,
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.500]   "What, it's not fair."
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.440]   It wasn't because God was unjust.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.620]   Because God promised them,
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.460]   and they're getting what they were promised,
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.300]   but the other people got better.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:20.040]   See, our idea of justice usually starts with us.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.660]   How does it benefit us?
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.180]   And so, because it starts with us,
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.860]   it's always from our perspective,
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.560]   it's very difficult for us to really come down
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.480]   with what we think is just.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.580]   'Cause what we think is just is unjust
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.260]   from another person's perspective.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.620]   So, how do we do that?
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.180]   In Judges chapter 21, verse 25,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.560]   during the period of Judges, if you've read that text,
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.140]   he said that the reason why they kept on falling into sin
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.060]   cycle over and over again,
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.260]   he says, "In those days, there were no king in Israel,
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.460]   "and everyone did what was right in his own eyes."
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.940]   Do you notice here, they didn't say,
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.640]   "Everyone did what was wrong in their own eyes."
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.180]   Everyone did what they thought was right in their own eyes.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.620]   What they thought was righteous,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.540]   what they thought was just.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.340]   And that's what kept on causing this problem, a cycle,
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.940]   because there was no king.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:17.340]   Well, the Bible tells us that Christ comes
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.860]   in the order of Melchizedek,
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.540]   and there's only one king of righteousness.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.020]   And until he is established as king,
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.180]   we have a tendency, all of us,
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.620]   to do what is right in our own eyes.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.420]   And what we think is right in our own eyes
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.900]   would be unright or unrighteous in someone else's eyes,
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.140]   and eventually, you're gonna meet each other.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:43.240]   In your pursuit of justice from your perspective,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.540]   you're gonna meet somebody else
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.780]   in pursuit of justice in their perspective,
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.900]   and you're gonna clash, and the result is going to be
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.400]   whoever has the biggest gun is going to win.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.000]   And that's where war comes from.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.160]   Two countries seeking justice in their own eyes,
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.460]   and whoever has the biggest guns
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.780]   ends up determining what is just.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.120]   The second reason why it is difficult for us,
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.580]   and only Christ can be the king of righteousness,
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.220]   king of justice, our idea of justice keeps changing.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.180]   What was just 30 years ago is no longer just today.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.700]   What was just 100 years ago is no longer just today.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.660]   I remember right after 9/11,
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.100]   the whole country was outraged, Republicans and Democrats.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.860]   And for the first time, I saw the Republicans, Democrats,
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.100]   standing side by side with their arms linked,
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.040]   saying, "We're gonna go to war.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.400]   "We cannot let them attack our family and children
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.780]   "in our land."
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:52.140]   And so they all universally, not just President Bush,
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.120]   the Democrats, Republicans said, "We are united.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.140]   "We are not divided."
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.100]   They went to war.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.700]   Since then, years have passed,
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.700]   and many anti-war movements have come in,
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.020]   and now these same politicians who at that time,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.300]   in order to get elected and stay elected,
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   voted for the war, now they're backtracking,
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.620]   saying that was a mistake,
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.580]   because what was right then is no longer right today.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.620]   Even in the church, if we're not careful,
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.720]   if our righteousness is not grounded in Christ and his word,
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.740]   what was acceptable 30 years ago
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.860]   is no longer acceptable today.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.900]   What wasn't acceptable 30 years ago
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.140]   is no longer acceptable today.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.240]   Our tendency is that we continue to change.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.940]   There is no such thing as relative truth.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.220]   In order for justice to be true justice,
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.820]   it has to be justice in every generation.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.420]   It can't be just to you and then unjust to that person,
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.100]   because in the context of practicing justice,
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.020]   you're going to practice injustice with somebody else.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:03.060]   Truth has to be immovable.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.780]   Truth cannot be flexible.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:10.820]   You cannot know anything unless you have truth.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.740]   The Bible uses the term cubit
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.580]   to describe a size of something.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.380]   10 cubit, 15 cubit.
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.940]   If you've never heard that term
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.880]   or somebody never explained to you
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.180]   the size of what a cubit is,
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.740]   you probably have no idea.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.760]   A cubit could be a mile.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.100]   A cubit could be a weight.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.980]   Cubit could be half a mile.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.140]   You don't know.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.340]   The only way that we know what a cubit is
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.760]   is we compare it with something
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.300]   that we know to be true, that it doesn't change.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.380]   A cubit usually is a measure between
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.780]   someone's arm and his hands, his palms.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:51.900]   In the average, it's about 12 inches, about a foot.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.060]   When the Bible says it's a cubit of something,
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.620]   it's about a foot of something.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.540]   20 cubits would be 20 foot, something, right?
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.500]   But we know what it is
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.180]   because we're able to compare with something
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.140]   that is consistent.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.420]   If a cubit is something to you
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.220]   and it's something to you and it's different to him
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.540]   and it's different today and different tomorrow,
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.400]   you can never know what a cubit is.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.860]   You can't practice justice
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.820]   if what justice looks like is different today
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.260]   and it's different tomorrow.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.620]   It's different to this person,
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.900]   but it's different to that person.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.580]   To the rich, justice looks like this.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.420]   To the poor, justice looks like this.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:31.000]   See, you and I are not able to practice perfect justice
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.720]   because it is constantly changing
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   when it is based upon ourselves.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.420]   In Isaiah 40, verse eight, it says,
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.060]   "The grass withers, the flowers fade,
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.100]   "but the word of God stands forever."
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.720]   There's only one thing that stands consistent,
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.920]   generation after generation.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.500]   The truth is the truth.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.380]   Whether you are white, black, Asian, Hispanic,
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.220]   it doesn't matter.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.220]   It is the truth.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.660]   And so he says, "The king of righteousness is Christ."
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.380]   The king of justice is Christ.
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.700]   And if Christ is not king, there is no justice
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:05.180]   because justice cannot be relative.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.820]   Thirdly, it's hard for us to practice justice
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.660]   because we lack knowledge.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.780]   Right now, you have to be very, very careful
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.300]   how you consume information.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.200]   And it is not only true today, it is true all the time.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.000]   I remember one of the best things that I learned
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.180]   while I was in seminary or while I was taking Bible class,
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.300]   and we were learning Western civilization,
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.500]   and our professor gave us an assignment.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.700]   It said, "All your resources has to be firsthand resources."
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.420]   For those of you who don't know what firsthand resources,
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.980]   you have to go to the original person who wrote it.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.780]   And so I said, "Well, how do I even do that?"
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.780]   So he said, he told us where these resources are,
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.720]   and we have to go to certain seminaries,
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.940]   and we have to go to Cal State, we have to go to UC,
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.300]   and if you go to the dungeon,
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.660]   usually people don't read this stuff
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.140]   'cause a lot of times it's not translated,
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.340]   or if it is translated, it's very difficult to read,
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:58.700]   and it's volumes and volumes.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.380]   So it's not a condensed version.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.460]   It's just original writing of whoever wrote it.
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.380]   So we were learning about Western civilization,
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.900]   and so I had to go dig up books in the dungeon
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.420]   that they probably haven't been touched for decades,
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.780]   and only people like us who are learning how to do research
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.620]   would ever even go look for these books.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.600]   And I remember doing research
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.800]   about certain particular period of history,
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.660]   and the point that he was trying to make
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.380]   is how much of the history books
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.220]   are their interpretation of what they read.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.660]   So you can have one person write about George Washington
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.100]   as the godliest man on earth,
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.400]   and you can have another person
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.660]   writing about George Washington,
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.540]   and he was a reprobate, which is true.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:43.280]   So he was teaching us how to go to the original source.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.580]   So all information, not just media,
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.820]   all information come through people
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.580]   who have sinful agendas,
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.140]   'cause they are looking at things from their purpose,
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.540]   whether they are doing it deliberately,
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.580]   whether they're doing it because they are blind,
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.540]   all information, we have to be careful.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.560]   We, especially now,
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:09.100]   because of how fast information spreads,
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:14.020]   we've all seen videos of cops pushing people.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.580]   Oh, that's another sign of racism,
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.100]   and then we see the larger context
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.820]   of somebody trying to swing a bat at him
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.620]   or a malative cocktail, and that part is not shown.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.140]   They only show you that part where he pushed,
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:26.980]   and they said, oh my gosh,
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:28.180]   they didn't show the whole context.
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:30.220]   And you can see that in the other,
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.400]   where you can see a police officer arresting that person,
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.280]   and they say, hey, this guy was resisting arrest,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.200]   and he was doing all this stuff.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.160]   When you see the larger context, that wasn't the case.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.000]   He wasn't resisting the arrest, and there was abuse.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.900]   So we have to be very careful how we consume information,
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.280]   because we need to have perfect knowledge
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.340]   to be able to practice that.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.520]   But the problem is, even if we knew all the context,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.200]   you and I are not omniscient.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.620]   Job, if you remember, what, humanly speaking,
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.460]   has experienced tremendous injustice,
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.780]   'cause because he was righteous, he was targeted.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.300]   He loses his health, his children, his wealth,
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.340]   even his friends come there accusing him.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.620]   All this happened because you did something wrong.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.540]   There's three cycles of this in the book of Job,
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.720]   and finally, Job cracks.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.860]   He was standing strong until the end, and he cracks,
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.420]   and he says, God, why are you allowing this?
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.220]   I'm a righteous man, why did you do this to me?
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.540]   And he begins to complain, and then God shows up
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.700]   to speak to him in Job chapter 38, two to five.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.360]   Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.940]   In other words, Job, you have no idea what's going on.
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:44.520]   Now, gird up your loins like a man, and I will ask you,
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.060]   and you instruct me, since you are trying to say
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.700]   that you are being unjust.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.600]   Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.040]   Tell me if you have understanding.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.420]   Who set its measurements, since you know,
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.580]   or who stretched the line on it?
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.680]   In other words, do you know who you are,
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.620]   and do you know who you are?
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:04.460]   Question it.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.020]   In Job chapter 40, verse one and two,
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.500]   after three chapters of God putting him in his place,
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.980]   that you don't have the knowledge to be able to know
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.580]   what is right and what is wrong.
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.900]   And then he says, chapter 40, verse one and two,
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.500]   then the Lord said to Job, will the fault finder
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.040]   contend with the Almighty?
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.980]   In other words, it's not fair.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.900]   Let him who reproves God answer it.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:34.400]   God not only knows all things, he knows us.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.460]   Not only does he know all the information,
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.380]   in Psalm 139, two to four, you know when I sit down
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.540]   and when I rise up, you understand my thought from afar,
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.220]   you scrutinize my path and my lying down,
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.260]   and are intimately acquainted with all my ways.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.020]   Even before there is a word on my tongue,
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:52.420]   behold, O Lord, you know it all.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.200]   Not only does he know all information
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.120]   because he's the creator, he says he already knows
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:03.000]   what's in our heart, if there really is racism or not.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.040]   He already knows what's crooked.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.160]   He already knows our intention,
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.060]   even before we actually even do it.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.800]   See, you and I lack knowledge.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.100]   We lack context.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.320]   Do you have that picture?
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   I don't know, I think I might have missed it.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.360]   You do, okay, can you put that up?
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.840]   See that picture?
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.840]   Remember that?
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:23.380]   Remember this?
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.220]   What color is that?
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.220]   Some of you guys may remember,
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.020]   'cause I saw it all over your Facebook.
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.540]   Some people see it as blue and black,
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.120]   some people see it as white and gold, right?
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:38.300]   Okay, this picture, I don't know if this is,
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.460]   if this represents that properly,
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.060]   but this was a big thing on the internet
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.120]   because it's actually, I guess for most people,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.180]   they see it blue and gold, and a lot of people saw it
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:49.540]   as white, no, blue and black, a lot of people saw it
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.400]   as white and gold, and they were fighting each other.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.480]   You guys remember this?
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.320]   Am I the only one that has internet?
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.200]   Okay, yeah, so they're looking at this,
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.400]   and they were, 'cause absolutely adamant.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.780]   How do you know what is true?
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:08.160]   If enough people say it's black and blue,
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.000]   does it become black and blue?
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.720]   What if they actually see white and gold?
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.960]   See, you and I don't have the ability
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.760]   to make that final judgment.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.000]   Only God knows.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.360]   Not only does God know the truth,
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.080]   only God knows our heart.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.960]   But fourth and most importantly,
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.640]   this is what you and I need to remember.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.620]   We are sinful.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.280]   So our perspective will always be sinful.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.440]   Even the way that we see justice is sinful.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.360]   In Romans 3, 10 through 12, it says that,
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.480]   "As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.000]   "There is none who understands.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.720]   "There is none who seeks for God.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.840]   "All have turned aside.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.440]   "Together they have become useless.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.800]   "There is none who does good.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.600]   "There is not even one."
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.200]   Now, some people may look at that and say,
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.500]   "That's a hyperbole.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.660]   "That can't be true.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.340]   "Nobody seeks God, not even one.
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:09.940]   "Everybody has turned aside.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.760]   "Together they have become useless."
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.460]   Clearly, there has to be hyperbole.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.760]   This can't be true.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.400]   Either he is just overblowing the state of mankind,
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.680]   or if he is actually telling the truth,
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.460]   there's not a single person who's exempt from this.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:36.960]   And because Satan and sin has tainted not only our heart,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.800]   but our sight and our mind,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   our ability to even reason has been tainted by sin.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.360]   And that is the starting point of salvation,
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.520]   when we recognize that we have sinned,
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.320]   and that sin has tainted all that I am.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.520]   So repentance isn't just, "I repent because I did this act.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.120]   "I repent because I did that."
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   Repentance is recognizing that I don't have the ability
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.960]   to know what is right and wrong.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.920]   I don't just repent about an act, I repent of who I am.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.540]   It's our sin that causes us to see things
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.260]   in certain perspective.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.500]   And until we humble ourselves before the throne,
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.580]   when we say, "No justice, no peace,"
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.340]   if we're not careful, you can do more damage than good.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:34.200]   Hurt people have a tendency to hurt other people.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.500]   True.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.680]   Hurt people have a tendency to hurt other people.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.100]   But here's the problem.
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.060]   Who's in here that hasn't been hurt?
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:51.620]   I can tell you, in 30 plus years that I've been
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.320]   in ministry and counseling people,
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.220]   I haven't met a single person, not one,
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.100]   who doesn't have deep pain.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.980]   Whether it was somebody did something to them,
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.340]   or something happened in their life,
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.680]   or coming from their families,
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.460]   or even just from their own sins,
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.740]   there's not a single person that I've ever met
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.220]   that isn't hurt.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:19.900]   And so our natural tendency for those who are hurt
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.100]   is to hurt other people.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:25.900]   You know, the most dangerous people are not the people
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.680]   who are doing wrong and they know it's wrong.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.340]   Those most dangerous people are people
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.780]   who think they're right.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.900]   They're unrighteous in carrying out
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.560]   their what they think is justice.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.440]   Because they feel it's right.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.700]   Because we feel it's right.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.180]   That even when it's, even the way we do it,
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.780]   even if it's wrong, because we're on the right,
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.620]   it justifies it.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:58.340]   Our sinfulness causes us to make it difficult
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.720]   for us to carry out justice.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:08.020]   But here's what the gospel says.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.060]   Jesus Christ comes in the office of Melchizedek.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.140]   He's the king of justice.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.700]   And only when justice is carried out by the king,
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.780]   we can have true peace.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.880]   Remember, if you look at the Jewish community,
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.980]   nobody suffered more than the Jewish people,
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.720]   all the way up to modern history.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.800]   If you look at their history, they started out in slavery.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.600]   For hundreds of years, they were oppressed
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.820]   by the Egyptians.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.340]   And the reason why they started was because God
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.220]   heard their oppression and crying out,
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.340]   and he answered their prayer, and he delivered them.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.020]   And then they wandered out in the desert,
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.020]   and they had to fight and scrap just to get
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.240]   into the promised land.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.620]   But a few years later, the Assyrians come in
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.320]   and brutalizes them, forced them into labor,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.420]   take all the precious things and all the precious people,
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.700]   and they take them into bondage,
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.900]   and they are living in bondage.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.620]   And after that, the Babylonians come,
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.820]   and they enslave them.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.220]   After that, the Persians come, and they're a little bit
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.840]   more gracious, but for the most part,
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.760]   they're living under dominion.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.460]   After the Persians come, it came the Greeks,
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.740]   and Greeks dominated them.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.580]   And after the Greeks came, the Romans came,
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.860]   and then the Romans dominated them.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.420]   And I don't have to tell you about the modern history.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.460]   We know about the Holocaust.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.980]   But there's almost 2,000 years in between of suffering.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.120]   In fact, you can take a whole class,
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.500]   if you go to the university, of just the suffering
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.580]   of the Jewish people.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:37.100]   But at the time of Christ, when Jesus was telling
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.700]   his people, when you get slapped on one cheek,
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.800]   turn the other cheek.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.400]   Do you know why Jesus said that?
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.040]   Because they were getting slapped.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.220]   Jesus said to the Jewish people,
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.440]   if they tell you to walk a mile, walk a second mile.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.420]   That wasn't a random statement.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:56.020]   There was actually a Roman law that said,
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.420]   even if you're a pregnant woman, if you were a Jew,
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.500]   a Roman soldier carrying all of his equipment got tired,
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.700]   and said, I need you to carry this by law.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.300]   They had to carry it a mile.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.020]   By law.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:12.920]   So you can imagine the animosity and the hatred
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.500]   that they had that was built up
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.580]   from generation to generation.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.320]   If any group of people that was oppressed,
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.620]   it was the Jewish people.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:27.180]   So you can understand why they wanted a militant Messiah.
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.540]   They wanted the Messiah to come and finally
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.000]   overthrow their enemies.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.540]   Because they were living injustice.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.760]   They felt this injustice day after day.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.040]   But remember when Jesus was going into Jerusalem, he wept.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.160]   Remember why he wept?
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.100]   He wept because he said, only if you knew today
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.400]   what would bring true peace.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.560]   But because you did not recognize the King of justice,
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.440]   you will not see this peace.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.380]   And he wept.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:09.940]   And it was finally time for him to go to the cross
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:13.860]   when he was offered up with Barabbas.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.820]   They rejected him.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.980]   And it was not by accident that Barabbas was a zealot
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.580]   who was a militant Jew who wanted to overthrow
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.740]   their enemies with his knife.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.460]   They wanted to overthrow.
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.700]   And so they wanted Jesus to join the revolution.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.220]   And when he would not and he gave up his life
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.680]   and he surrendered, what did they say?
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.960]   We'd rather have Barabbas.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.300]   We want somebody who's going to bring justice
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.860]   the way we want justice.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.860]   And so they crucified him.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:54.100]   Because he would not join the revolution.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.140]   Because the peace that he was going to bring
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.720]   did not look anything like they were expecting.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.260]   In Isaiah chapter 42, verse one and four says,
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.220]   behold my servant whom I uphold,
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.780]   my chosen one in whom my soul delights,
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.300]   I have put my spirit upon him,
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.220]   he will bring forth justice to the nations.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.220]   If we stop right there, you would think
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:20.020]   that they were right to wait for the Messiah,
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.380]   the King to overthrow.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.220]   Because if any group of people
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.660]   would have been shouting in their souls,
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.480]   no justice, no peace.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.820]   We want Shalom.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.300]   And we want a Messiah that's going to come
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.240]   and bring justice.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.440]   But this messianic promise doesn't end in verse one,
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.940]   it goes in verse two, it says,
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.860]   he will not cry out or raise his voice.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.900]   He's talking about how he's going to bring his justice.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.500]   He will not cry out or raise his voice,
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.360]   nor make his voice heard in the street.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.500]   A bruised reed he will not break,
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.860]   and a dimly burning wick he will not extinguish.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.040]   He will faithfully bring forth justice.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.540]   See that part in verse two and three
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:16.140]   doesn't fit what we think justice is.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:21.780]   He came and he offered his life.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.940]   The only just human being,
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:29.700]   the only righteous being that has ever lived on this earth,
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:34.100]   the only one who had the right to say no justice, no peace.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.460]   Only person who walked this earth
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:41.760]   who could justly say no justice, no peace,
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.080]   absorbed our sins.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.420]   And as it says in 1 Peter 3, 18,
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.640]   for Christ also died for sins once for all,
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.300]   the just for the unjust,
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.620]   so that he might bring us to God,
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.780]   having put forth to death in the flesh,
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.000]   but made alive in the spirit.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.660]   The greatest injustice on earth
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:11.580]   was experienced by Christ, the only just.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.060]   The just for the unjust.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.580]   You know, people are saying, why don't we march?
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.680]   I don't have any problem with marching.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.960]   If you see racism, you should call it out.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.640]   If something is wrong, we should not stay silent.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:36.000]   But I've heard people say,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.960]   is all we're going to do preach the gospel?
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.720]   And I hear some people say that,
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.320]   even from pastors, I hear people saying that.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.420]   Do you not realize that that's why we preach the gospel
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.500]   in the first place?
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:58.240]   Social justice and the gospel are not two separate things.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.320]   We preach the gospel because the gospel
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.040]   is the only answer to racism.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.980]   The Jews want signs, the Greek want wisdom.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.180]   And the reason why they want signs and they want wisdom
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.540]   is because that's what they think power is.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.800]   But Paul says, we preach Christ crucified.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.760]   Foolishness to those who are perishing,
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.520]   but to those who are being saved,
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.000]   the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.700]   Do you believe this?
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:36.300]   Especially now, as the world is chanting,
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.260]   because they think they know the answer.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.160]   As Christians whose eyes have been opened
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.440]   to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.720]   Justice can only be found when Christ
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.940]   is established as King.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.280]   And true peace, true shalom,
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.240]   will only come to us by the grace,
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.920]   by the blood and the body broken for us.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.640]   This morning, we're going to participate in this communion.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.920]   And so I want you guys to take this.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.160]   And again, it's going to be a little bit different.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.920]   And I apologize for those of you who are home.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.560]   The reason why we don't do this for when we're separated
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.920]   is because part of the significance
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.380]   and the meaning behind the communion
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.800]   is the gathering of believers.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.820]   Jesus says, when you are together to do this
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.360]   in remembrance of me.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.800]   And so we want to make sure that the meaning behind this
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.400]   is our unity, our physical gathering
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.580]   to express our unity in Christ.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.300]   And so we hope that this is the first and last time
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.120]   we do this for those of you who are at home.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.160]   Hopefully you can join us the next time.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.600]   But if you can take the lid off.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.400]   And I was told that some people in first service
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.560]   didn't know that there is a little wafer inside.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.080]   Okay, so if you didn't get to the wafer,
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.460]   if you look at the top, there's a little bread.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.200]   And there's a reason why we don't do this normally
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.800]   because this is much harder than I thought.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.720]   First service, it just came right out.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.120]   Okay, all right, there it goes.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.280]   So if you take this, representing the body of Christ
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.360]   and the blood of Christ, as we participate in this,
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.840]   that we're uniting in expressing
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.080]   that our hope is found in Christ.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.320]   So don't take it yet, okay?
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.880]   We're gonna do it all together.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.680]   That our hope is found in Christ.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.000]   That we establish him as the King of righteousness,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.200]   King of justice, and King of peace.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.660]   And that we are united.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.320]   We're not divided by our politics.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.400]   We're not divided by which side that we take
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.040]   'cause ultimately, we're united in Christ.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.920]   He's the answer.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   It's okay for us to feel injustice.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.140]   We should feel compassionate for those who are oppressed.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.000]   Those people who are hurting,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.800]   even if we have different opinions, it's okay to do that.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.400]   But do not join the crowds.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.320]   In chanting and wanting a form of a Messiah
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.000]   that you think you're gonna revolutionize the world.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.540]   Only Jesus has that power.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:23.040]   So as we participate in this communion and this bread,
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.920]   let's be united in Christ,
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.920]   expressing what he has done and being thankful.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.200]   Let me read for us in 1 Corinthians 11:23,
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.600]   for I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.720]   to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.600]   in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.400]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.860]   this is my body which is for you.
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.340]   Do this in remembrance of me.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.660]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.640]   saying, this cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.920]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.660]   So let me pray for us and after that,
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.960]   we'll participate together, okay?
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.380]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for allowing us
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.600]   to participate in this sacred event.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.560]   Remembering again that our hope is founded on Christ
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.440]   because of what he has done for us on the cross
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.600]   and because of his new resurrected life, Lord God,
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.740]   that our hope is firmly planted in him.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:20.280]   I pray especially now, there's so much anger and division
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.040]   in our world, especially in our country.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.820]   Help us, Lord God, to be a light.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:28.720]   Help us, Lord God, to show the world
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.600]   that there is hope in the name of Jesus.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.960]   As you sent your only begotten son,
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:39.340]   that the just may justify the unjust.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:44.920]   I pray that this celebration of this sacred time
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.340]   cause us to be united and to be committed,
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.280]   that we may spread the gospel
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.840]   and to be of the almighty love of Christ wherever we go.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.240]   (gentle piano music)
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.500]   (pastor and congregation clapping)
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:30.160]   As we close out our communion,
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.520]   why don't we all stand for our closing praise?
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:39.440]   (gentle piano music)

[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:51.520]   - Our benediction comes from Isaiah 11, verse three to four.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.080]   And he will delight in the fear of the Lord
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.800]   and he will not judge by what his eyes see,
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.780]   nor make a decision by what his ears hear.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.300]   But with righteousness he will judge the poor
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.640]   and decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:07.440]   And he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth
