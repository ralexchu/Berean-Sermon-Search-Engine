[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Happy Lord's Day and Merry Christmas.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Before we begin our worship,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   I just wanted to read a verse
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   that should be familiar to us
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   in Isaiah chapter nine, verse six.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   "For a child will be born to us,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   "a son will be given to us,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.200]   "and the government will rest on his shoulders,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   "and his name will be called
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   "Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   "There will be no end
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   "to the increase of his government or of peace
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   "on the throne of David and over his kingdom
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   "to establish it and to uphold it
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   "with justice and righteousness
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   "from then on and forevermore.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   "The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this."
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   So as we come before our God
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   in celebration of Christmas,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.200]   I pray that what we sing here today,
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   what we hear today,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   that we may have fertile and open hearts
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   to give God the glory he deserves.

[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   - All right, good morning.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   And as you guys know, as we're celebrating
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   the birth of Christ and today being the Christmas Eve,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   obviously the pulpit is not here
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   because we have a special presentation.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   We have a choir.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.120]   We have our young children and our elementary department.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.120]   So it's a privilege to be in here
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   and doing the presentations in between
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.120]   before I come to give the sermon.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   But let me give you a few announcements
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.120]   that are relevant for the next few weeks.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.120]   First of all, next Sunday is the New Year's Eve service.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   Though we have a morning service,
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   at nighttime we have a Christmas Eve service
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   that we have every year at 11 p.m.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   And so during the day we have a ping pong tournament.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   Those of you guys who want to come to church
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   and even just to watch, it's going to be at three o'clock.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   And if you still want to sign up,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.120]   you can sign up for that.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   But the church will be open all day.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   So we'll have the morning worship
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120]   and then the church will be open
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.120]   and the cafe is going to be open
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.120]   from about five o'clock until our worship time
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   and then it starts at 11.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.120]   And we're going to try to be done
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.120]   everything out the door by 12.30
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   so that you don't have to go home too late.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.120]   Those of you who cannot make it because of your children,
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   we will have live streaming as well.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   But again, we want to encourage you
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   so that our church could be together
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   to give the first fruits of our offering,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   our worship to our Lord together.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.120]   So that's going to be taking place next Sunday.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.120]   And then we have a new round of membership class
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.120]   that's happening on January 14th.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   So if you're applying to become a member,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.120]   please sign up for that.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   And then we have a members meeting
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.120]   on that Sunday at 2 p.m.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   So please mark that on your calendar as well.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   And as you guys know, we have this service,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   next Sunday service,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   and then Sunday after that, January 7th,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   we're going to be beginning our three services.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.120]   8 a.m. is the first service.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   And there's no child care taking place at 8 a.m. service.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.120]   But 9.30 a.m. is, again,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.120]   child care only up to second grade.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120]   So there's going to be child care
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   if you have little ones.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   And then up to second grade,
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   there's an elementary department,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   some lessons that are going on.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   And then 11.30 is where the full education
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   is going to be happening, youth group, full education.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.120]   And so please mark that on your calendar
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   and try to make it to the service
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   that you're committed to for that, okay?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   One last thing.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   We've been mentioning how we're going to be taking
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   Lottie Moon Christmas missions offering,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.120]   which we do every year.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   The offering that you give,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   please mark that clearly that it is for Lottie Moon,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   it's for the missions offering,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   so that we can distinguish that from the regular offering.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.120]   The offering that we collect,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   that we will send to the IMB,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   and they will distribute that to the missionaries
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   who are abroad and use it for mission purposes.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   So please, when you give, please mark that,
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.120]   and then we'll let you know
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.120]   how much we're able to give this year, okay?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   All right, I think that's it for the announcement.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   So before I pray for the offering,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.120]   again, if you are just visiting us
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.120]   and you have a physical offering,
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   there's a physical offering box in the back,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120]   and for the rest of you,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   you can go online and give it through Zelle.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   And there will be some announcements.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.120]   We're going to be changing some of the things
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.120]   that we're doing about offerings starting next year,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   but we'll give that announcement next year.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.120]   After I pray, during the offering time,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   our choir is going to come up,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   and they're going to be doing
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   their special Christmas presentation this morning.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   All right?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   Let's pray.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.120]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   for the privilege that we have to come to you week after week
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   to come into your presence seeking help in time of need,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.120]   to worship you, to thank you, Father God,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   for the goodness that you've already given in our lives.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   We especially want to thank you, Lord,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.120]   as we celebrate the birth of Christ,
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   that you would install in us the true meaning
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.120]   of what this represents,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   that we would not be distracted, Lord,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   with all the busyness and things that are going on,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   that we miss the main point of what we're doing.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   We pray that our Christmas service would be a reminder
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   of why this day is so important,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   that we may praise you and honor you
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   and worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   We pray, Father, that you would bless and anoint
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   even this offering, may it be multiplied
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.120]   and used for your kingdom.

[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   [cheers and applause]
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   And for all the teachers who are sacrificing every Sunday
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   to watch and teach the kids.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   [cheers and applause]
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.640]   I feel like we doubled in number for the children
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   in the last year,
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.640]   so hopefully we'll have enough space to fill them next year.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   But, again, people have been being fruitful and multiplying,
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   and we're just very thankful.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   Again, you know, we have children presentation,
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   like, when the newborns come,
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   and we try to present them,
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   and it's all happening almost quarterly
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   because so many people are having children.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   But in the context of that, we, you know,
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   want to continue to emphasize that the strength of our church
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.640]   is not just how it is conveyed to the next generation,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   but how it is conveyed to the next generation.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   So these children are the ones who are going to inherit
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   whatever labor and sacrifices that you make
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   so that they may be the heralder of the gospel
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   in the next generation.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   So please continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.640]   to Matthew chapter 1, verse 18 through 25.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.640]   And I'll read in the NASB.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.640]   It says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.640]   Mary had been betrothed to Joseph.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   Before they came together, she was found to be with child
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   and not wanting to disgrace her,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   planned to send her away secretly.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   But when he had considered this,
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   saying, 'Joseph, son of David,
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife,
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   for the child who has been conceived in her
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   is of the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus,
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.640]   for he will save his people from their sins.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.640]   Now all this took place to fulfill
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   Behold, a virgin shall be with child
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   and shall bear a son,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.640]   which translated means God with us.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   And Joseph awoke from his sleep
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   and took Mary as his wife,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a son,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.640]   and he called his name Jesus."
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   Let's pray.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.640]   We pray that your word, Lord God,
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   would come alive and open our eyes
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.640]   to see the truth of the glory of what you've given us.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   Help us, Lord God,
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   to fix our attention upon Christ,
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.640]   his birth, and the significance it has in our lives.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   You know, as we celebrate Christmas,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   and I think we can remember
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.640]   we have various stages that people go through
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   in how we celebrate Christmas.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   You know, when we're young children like at their age,
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.640]   you know, everything is so exciting.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.640]   Parents are getting together.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   You're anticipating your gifts.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   And then you get a little bit older,
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   and you get--you become bahumba.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   You're too cool for this, right,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   to dress up and stand in front of people, you know?
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.640]   And then you get a little bit older,
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   and as you become an adult,
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   you start to see the significance of it,
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   and especially once you start having children.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   A lot of the young families here,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   you know, the hard work that you put in,
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   you get to participate and see that,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.640]   and it's amazing, and then as you get older,
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   you know, you have--become grandparents,
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   and, you know, there's various stages that you go through,
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   and I know we have people from various stages,
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   even in this room,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   of how we think of Christmas.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   But beyond how it is subjectively we celebrate,
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   what it means to us,
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   traditions that you have created in your family,
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   beyond that, we need to properly understand
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   what is the objective truth
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   of why we celebrate this,
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   because Christmas has become a universal holiday,
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.640]   whether you believe Christ or not,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   even in the Middle East,
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   you'll see Santa Claus, you'll see Christmas trees,
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.640]   they'll sing Christmas songs,
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   not really understanding what they're singing.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   Even in communist China,
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   where atheism is taught in school,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   you'll see Christmas signs everywhere.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   People will say, "Merry Christmas."
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   They'll sing "Holy Night,"
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   and they'll sing it to each other,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   and then if you ask them the meaning behind that,
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   and they say, "Well, it's something
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   "that came from the United States,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.640]   "from Christianity,"
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   but they don't fully understand.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   As Christians here, obviously,
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   when we celebrate,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   we know that this day specifically
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   is about the incarnation of God's only son,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   who came and took on human form,
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   that he may be a sympathetic high priest.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   We want to look at the text this morning
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   in Matthew 1:21,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   where the angel appears to Joseph,
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.640]   and appears and basically tells him
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.640]   that this is the reason
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   why we celebrate Christmas.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   There's three things that he mentions
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   in Matthew 1:21.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   He says, "She will bear a son, number one.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   "Two, you shall call his name Jesus, number two.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   "And third, for he will save his people
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   "from their sins."
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   So there's three things prophesied
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   about the birth of Christ,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   and I want to follow along these prophecies
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   so that we may, at the end of this,
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   at least have three clear things
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   that you can focus on
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.640]   as we celebrate Christmas today and tomorrow.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   One, the angel says,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.640]   "She will bear a son."
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   Now, this was not a gender reveal party, right?
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   Like people do today, they gather together.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   You know, some of you guys have children
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   and two, three months into it,
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   you want to reveal to people,
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.640]   "Is it a son? Is it a girl?
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   "Is it going to be blue?
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   "Is it going to be pink?"
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   The angel was not revealing the gender of a child.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   This was not just a child.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   This was the child.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.640]   If you look previously, before the angel makes his prophecy,
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   Matthew begins with a long, boring list of names.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   And so if you don't understand what's going on,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   you may look at that and say,
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   "Wow, this is the presentation of the Son of God,
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   "and you have a whole chapter
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.640]   "dedicated to his genealogy."
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   But the reason why the genealogy is there
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   is to connect the Son
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.640]   with the fulfilled prophecies
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.640]   of the coming Messiah.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   So when the angel says that you will have a son,
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.640]   that this son was not going to be any ordinary son.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   It was going to come through a virgin birth.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   It was specifically for a fulfilled prophecy
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   that they'd been waiting for hundreds of years,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   and thousands of years.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   The very next text in Matthew 1, 22, 23 says,
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   "Now all this took place
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   "to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.640]   "Behold, the virgin shall be with child
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   "and shall bear a son,
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   "and they shall call his name Immanuel."
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   The title that he has is God with us,
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   which translated means, again, God with us.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   That specific prophecy given through Isaiah
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   was given over 750 years
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   before Jesus ever showed up.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   So when the angel says that you're going to have a son,
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   he's saying you're going to have the son
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   that we've been waiting for, the Messiah.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.640]   You're going to have that son.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.640]   Micah 5, verse 2,
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.640]   500 years before Jesus ever shows up,
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.640]   it tells us where he's going to be born,
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.640]   in Bethlehem.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   Jeremiah 31, 15, 600 years before Jesus ever showed up,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.640]   Jeremiah prophesied that the fake king Herod
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   is going to go and slaughter all these young children
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   because he was afraid that he was going to lose his throne.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   The true king of Israel was going to come.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   That was prophesied 600 years before this ever happened.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.640]   And again, Isaiah 11, verse 1,
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.640]   it tells us that Jesus is going to come
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   through the line of Jesse, King David.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   He's going to come from the kingly line.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.640]   That's why we see the genealogy in Matthew 1
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.640]   telling us that there's proof
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   that Jesus is the fulfillment of that prophecy in Isaiah
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   which was given more than 750 years before he showed up.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   In fact, if I was to stand here today
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   and just go through the prophecies
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   that were fulfilled in Jesus' life,
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.640]   and more than 330 separate prophecies
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   that were made about Christ, his birth, his life,
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   his ministry, his death, his resurrection,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   330 separate prophecies.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   Now, even if you're a skeptic and say,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.640]   "You know what? I don't believe all this miracle
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.640]   "about the virgin birth and about the Son of God showing up."
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   Even if you choose to reject all of that,
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   at the minimum, it would be beneficial
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:07.640]   to take an objective look at what the Old Testament says.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.640]   And what are the odds that one human being
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   was able to fulfill over 300 separate things
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   that were stated about him?
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   So when this angel says, "You're going to have that child,"
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   he wasn't just a child.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   It was the child that's coming.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   And this child, in the second prophecy,
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   he comes with a name.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   As soon as a child is about to be born,
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.640]   one of the first things that we think about
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.640]   is what are we going to name him?
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   What's his name?
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.640]   And so in our generation, some of you put some thought into it
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   and maybe it's a family member or a significant name
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   or just some of you maybe choose just because it sounds good.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   Maybe you were picked on when you were a kid,
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   so you don't want to make sure
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.640]   that you can't pick on your child with this name.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   Well, at this particular time,
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.640]   Joseph and Mary were not given the opportunity
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.640]   to name their child because this child was directly from God.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   God names a child and says, "He is going to be named Jesus."
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   Now, the reason why this name is so significant,
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   Jesus is the Greek name of the Old Testament name Joshua.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   Now, Joshua is the butchered way that we say it.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   The actual Hebrew way of saying that is Yehoshua.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.640]   Yehoshua literally in Hebrew means Yahweh saves.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.640]   Yahweh saves.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.640]   Now, the significance of this name, of Jesus' name,
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   is it prophesies and tells us what Jesus is going to do,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   why he came.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   But what's interesting about this name, Yahweh saves,
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   is that if you look at the Hebrew spelling of this name,
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   the way we spell it in English is Y-A-H-W-E-H, Yahweh.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   The meaning behind this name is "to be."
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.640]   And so when Moses asks God,
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   when God tells Moses to go tell Pharaoh to let my people go,
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   Moses rightfully asks,
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   "By what authority am I going to go to Pharaoh
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   and demand my people go?
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   I'm a shepherd.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   I've been taking care of sheep for 40 years.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   By what authority?"
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   And God answers him saying,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.640]   "Tell them I Am has sent you.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   Yahweh has sent you.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   I Am who I Am has sent you."
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.640]   The meaning behind the name Yahweh
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.640]   basically means "life," "to be."
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.640]   He was, He is, and He will be.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   So if we were to translate that into modern-day significance,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.640]   basically it means "life."
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   Now, the interesting thing about this name
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.640]   is that when Hebrew was written in the Old Testament,
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   there was no vowels.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   So the A and the E that you see in Yahweh didn't exist.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.640]   So in the original Hebrew,
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   it's just spelled Y-H-W-H.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   Yod, He, Wo, He.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   Y-H-W-H.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   Now, the significance behind this word is
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   if you take the vowels out of this name
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   and you were to pronounce it without the vowels,
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   this is what it would sound like.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.640]   That's what it would sound like
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.560]   without the vowels.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.560]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.560]   What does it sound like?
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   Breath.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.560]   It's just sound of a breathing.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.560]   Now, the significance behind that is--
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.560]   I have an iPhone here, right?
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.560]   Some of you guys are iPhone haters.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.560]   iPhone wanted to make clear
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.560]   that when you turn it on and when you turn it off,
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.560]   that you know who owns you, okay?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   Or owns the phone, okay?
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.560]   [laughter]
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.560]   So the first thing that happens when you turn it on,
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   what do you see on the iPhone?
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.560]   The Apple, right?
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   Just in case you forgot, right?
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.560]   Who you--who you pay your money to, right?
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   And then when you turn it off,
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.560]   what's the last thing that you see before it turns off?
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.560]   The Apple symbol, right?
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   Because they want to remind you every time you turn it on,
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.560]   every time you turn it off,
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   that who this belongs to.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   Well, the very breath is an expression of his name.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   So when you and I are born,
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   the very first thing that comes out of our mouth is breath.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.560]   And sometimes if you don't breathe,
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   the doctor will spank you in the butt,
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   clear your throat,
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.560]   so that you would...
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   And then when you die,
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.560]   how does somebody know that you have passed,
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   that there's no more breath?
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.560]   So the very imprint of our--who we are,
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.560]   we come in saying,
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.560]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.560]   expressing his name.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   God has imprinted his creation.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.560]   God has imprinted himself in our very breath.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   In fact, when you come to the New Testament,
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.560]   God says he invested his breath into what?
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   To the Word of God.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.560]   Into the Word of God.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.560]   His very breath in his life was imprinted
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.560]   in the Word of God.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   Don't you think that's interesting
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   that God has placed his own imprint
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.560]   in every creation?
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   That he,
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.560]   that Yahweh is going to come,
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.560]   the very creator of all the universe,
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.560]   and the reason why you and I have breath,
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.560]   he's going to come,
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.560]   and he says he's going to come to save the world.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:49.560]   When you hear the word "saved,"
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.560]   right?
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.560]   You need to be saved.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.560]   The first question you need to ask is,
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.560]   saved from what?
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.560]   Typically, if you say,
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.560]   somebody says you need to be saved,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.560]   the question we would ask is,
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.560]   what kind of peril am I in
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.560]   that I need to be saved?
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.560]   And in particular,
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.560]   how bad must the situation be
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.560]   that the Son of God,
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.560]   Emmanuel, would come,
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.560]   that he would have to come
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.560]   and save me?
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.560]   That's the third prophecy he gives.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.560]   He said, "That Son,
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   whose name is Yahweh Saves,
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   is going to come
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.560]   and save us from their sins."
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   So, the angel prophesied this,
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   and then in John 1:29,
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   when John the Baptist was sent
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   to prepare for Jesus' ministry,
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.560]   when he sees Jesus
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   and introduces him into ministry,
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   this is what he says,
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.560]   "The next day he saw Jesus
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.560]   coming to him and said,
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   'Behold the Lamb of God
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.560]   who takes away
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   the sin of the world.'"
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.560]   So, the whole point
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   of his incarnation,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.560]   why he humbled himself
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.560]   and took on human form,
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.560]   is so that Yahweh can save us
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   from our sins, predominantly.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.560]   So, the next question
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.560]   that we need to be asking is,
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.560]   if we were in such peril
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.560]   that the Son of God
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.560]   would have to take on human form
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.560]   in order to save us from our sins,
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.560]   what does sin mean?
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.560]   The Old Testament word,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:11.560]   the Hebrew word for sin,
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.560]   is katah,
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.560]   and basically means
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.560]   to fail or to miss something,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.560]   to fail or to miss.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.560]   The Greek version of that
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.560]   in the New Testament
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.560]   is hamartia,
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.560]   and that word basically means
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.560]   to miss the mark,
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.560]   to miss the mark.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.560]   So, when you understand
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:29.560]   the core understanding
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   of katah and hamartia,
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.560]   it doesn't sound that bad.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   It sounds like you just missed.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   You tried to get something,
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.560]   and you just couldn't achieve it.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.560]   And so, judgment is coming
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.560]   because we failed?
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560]   I mean, we tried to get an A,
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.560]   and we got a B,
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   so, therefore, judgment is coming?
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   If we don't understand
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.560]   the context of this,
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.560]   you may think of sin
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   as a mistake,
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.560]   or we just didn't quite reach up
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   because God is so high.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.560]   We tried jumping,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   and we just couldn't reach Him.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.560]   That's what it may seem like
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.560]   in the beginning.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.560]   But the understanding of sin,
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   why this was so detrimental,
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   sin, basically,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.560]   the root understanding of sin
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   is the perversion of the good
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.560]   that God has created,
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.560]   that what God had imprinted
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   in creation and in us
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   has been perverted by man.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.560]   In 1 Timothy 4, 4,
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.560]   it says everything God created
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.560]   is good.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   Everything God created is good.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560]   So, if you look at Genesis,
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.560]   after every creation,
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.560]   how does it end?
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   And God saw that it was good.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.560]   God saw that it was good.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.480]   And every creation,
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   it ends with God created,
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.480]   what He created was good.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   And so the idea of sin is
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   that man comes in
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.480]   and takes what is good
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.480]   and perverts it.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.480]   Let me give you an example.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   Is food good or bad?
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   Food is good.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   We can't exist without food.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   But food,
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.480]   when it is taken too much,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.480]   we call it gluttony.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.400]   Right?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.400]   Which is one of the deadly sins.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   Food in itself is good.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   And when man indulges his flesh
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   without limit,
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   it becomes sinful.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   Now, let me see.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400]   Scan the room.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   Make sure we're safe.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   Okay?
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   If I say the word sex,
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   is that good or bad?
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.400]   You're afraid to say.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   I'll say it for you.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.400]   Sex is good.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   Should we say it together?
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   You look really uncomfortable.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   Sex is good
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   because God created it.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   God created it
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400]   so that husband and wife
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   can come together
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400]   and procreate.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   They cannot fulfill
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400]   the mandate of God
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400]   without sex.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.400]   But the reason why
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   the term sex
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   makes you feel uncomfortable
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.400]   is because mankind
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   has perverted it.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   Because when we think of sex,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.400]   we don't think of sex
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.400]   the way God created it.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.400]   We think of the perversion
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.400]   that has been introduced in sex.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400]   In fact,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   when we look at technology,
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.400]   is technology good or bad?
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.400]   Good.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   It makes life easier.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   We're able to communicate.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   You know,
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.400]   think how easy banking has become.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   You can do all your banking
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   without ever leaving your pajamas.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   Technology in itself is good.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.400]   But the number one use of internet,
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.400]   the number one use by far
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400]   is pornography.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.400]   What was created good,
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   man has chosen to use that
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.400]   for his own purpose
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   and his perversion.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   So the root understanding of sin
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   that caused the judgment of God
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   to come upon mankind
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   is his own desire
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.400]   to make himself
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   the owner of himself.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   Some of you guys
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.400]   who are a bit older
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400]   may know the song
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.400]   from Frank Sinatra,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   "I Did It My Way."
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.400]   And even if you're younger,
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   this song is so universally known
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.400]   that even though you were born
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.400]   decades after this man passed away,
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400]   you probably know this song,
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400]   "I Did It My Way."
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400]   And initially,
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400]   when you look at the lyrics,
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   it seems pretty innocuous.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   It seems pretty innocent.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.400]   But let me read it for you,
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   some of it.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]   It says,
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400]   "And now the end is near,
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.400]   "and so I face that final curtain.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   "My friend, I'll make it clear.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   "I'll state my case
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   "of which I'm certain.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.400]   "I've lived a life that's full.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   "I traveled each and every highway
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   "and more, much more,
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   "I did it my way.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   "Regrets, I've had a few,
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400]   "but then again,
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   "too few to mention.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400]   "I did what I had to do.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.400]   "I saw it through
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   "without exemption.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   "I planned each charted course,
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   "each careful step along the byway
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.400]   "and more, much more, much more.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   "I did it.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   "I did it my way.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.400]   "For what is a man?
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400]   "What has he got?
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400]   "If not himself,
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   "then he has not.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400]   "Not to say the things
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.400]   "that he truly feels
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400]   "and not the words
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   "of someone who kneels.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.400]   "And that's the key.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.400]   "If someone who kneels,
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   "let the record show
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.400]   "I took all the blows
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.400]   "and did it my way."
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   Now, especially
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   in the Western culture
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   where we value independence
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400]   and freedom,
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400]   "I did it my way"
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   sounds like a very good value to have.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   But what Ferenc Canessa expresses
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.400]   is the spirit of mankind,
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   not just our generation,
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   but spirit of mankind.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.400]   "I did it my way."
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.400]   In fact, in Romans chapter 1,
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.400]   when Apostle Paul describes to us
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.400]   why Christ was necessary,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   he describes in Romans chapter 1
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400]   that mankind refused
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   to acknowledge the Creator
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   and worship the creation instead.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400]   At the core of man's rebellion,
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.400]   he wanted to do it his way.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   "I'm going to do it my way.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]   "I'm going to do
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.400]   "whatever makes me happy."
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.400]   And as a result of that,
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   perverted every good thing
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   that God has created.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   What was meant for good,
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   man made it bad.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400]   On the surface,
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.400]   it looks like,
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.400]   "Well, I mean, that's it?
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.400]   "That's the description
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   "of rebellion?"
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   Imagine if you have a painting
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.400]   that was painted by Monet.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.400]   Okay, that's the only one
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400]   I can think of right now.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400]   And it's worth millions of dollars
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   because Monet's imprint is on there.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   Somebody comes in
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   and takes a paintbrush
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   and it's like,
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   "I'm going to do it my way."
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.400]   His impressionism,
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   it just doesn't do it for me.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.400]   It's not clear.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   I want to make the lines very clear.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400]   And so you take a paintbrush
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   and you start doing it my way.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400]   Well, what's so bad about that?
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.400]   Because that's not your paint.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.400]   You're ruining the creator's work.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   If somebody comes into your house
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.400]   that you paid for,
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.400]   that you live in,
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   chooses to change the lock
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   and come in
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   and eat whatever food
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.400]   from your refrigerator,
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.400]   sleep whatever bed
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400]   that you want to sleep in,
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.400]   and then he begins to say,
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.400]   "I did it my way."
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.400]   No one's going to look at that
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400]   as virtuous.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.400]   It's like,
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.400]   "How dare you do it your way?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.400]   "That's not yours."
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   The scripture tells us
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.400]   that we have been created
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   for the purpose of worshiping God.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.320]   And when we feel the most alive
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   is when we are acknowledging
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   his creatorship,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   his ownership of us.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   And yet mankind chooses
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   to rebel against that
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320]   and perverts, again,
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.320]   every good thing.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320]   And as a result of that,
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320]   it says in Isaiah 59,
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320]   "But your iniquities
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.320]   "have made a separation
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320]   "between you and your God,
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   "and your sins
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320]   "have hidden his face from you
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   "so that he does not hear."
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.320]   That our sins have separated us
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.320]   from the creator.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   The very name
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.320]   that we come into this earth
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   and leaving this earth,
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   we refuse to acknowledge
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   in between.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.320]   If you've ever been lost
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   as a child,
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320]   you know what it feels like
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   to be separated from somebody
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320]   who you are in dire need.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.320]   I remember when I was a young
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.320]   child living in Korea,
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.320]   I think I was maybe
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.320]   about four or five years old.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   My mom specifically told me,
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.320]   and I remember very vividly
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   because it was so traumatizing,
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.240]   my mom told me,
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.240]   "When you go out and play,"
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.240]   this is when children
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.240]   used to go play outside, right?
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.240]   "When you go out and play,
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.240]   "you cannot go
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   "beyond these boundaries."
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240]   And she specifically told me,
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   "Don't cross this bridge
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   "because once you cross
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   "that bridge,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.240]   "it's not going to be safe."
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.240]   So being a good middle child
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.240]   that I am,
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.240]   I needed to know
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.240]   what's on that other side.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   So I chose to cross that bridge
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   because I wanted to know
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   how hard could it be?
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.240]   You know, to come back.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   Well, I went there
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.240]   and I started to check out
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.240]   different things
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.240]   and I don't know
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   how much time went by
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   but I realized I needed
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   to get home and I turned around
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   and I could not find the bridge.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   I couldn't find how I got there.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   So I remember just panicking.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.240]   How am I going to get home?
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   The sun's going to go down.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   If my mom finds out,
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   I'm going to be in trouble.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   But even more than that,
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.240]   I don't know where to go.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   I don't know how to eat.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.240]   What's going to happen?
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   And somebody in that neighborhood
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.160]   recognized how lost I was
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.160]   and grabbed my hand
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.160]   and told me what happened
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   and I told them
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160]   I crossed this bridge
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.160]   and it's like,
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.160]   oh yeah, that bridge is over there
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.160]   and took me back home.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.160]   For a child to lose his mom or dad
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   is the end of his life.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   The Bible tells us
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   that our Creator
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   who created us,
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160]   who sustains us
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   because of our own rebellion,
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160]   I'm going to do it my way
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   that we have been separated
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   from this God.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.160]   And as a result,
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.160]   the most important question
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   of mankind is
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.160]   why am I here?
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160]   What is my purpose?
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160]   What's going to happen
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.160]   after I die?
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160]   Nobody knows
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.160]   and everybody's just guessing
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.160]   even though the Creator
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.160]   has made it very clear.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   Everybody's just going to
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.160]   make the best that we can.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   Whoever has the most toy wins.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   And yet,
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.160]   every single person
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   who ever lives on this earth
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.160]   has the same question.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.160]   The biggest question.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.160]   Where did I come from?
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.160]   Why am I here?
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.160]   You mean we came from nothing?
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.160]   Even the most smartest,
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.160]   well-educated scientist,
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.160]   the best that they came up with
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.160]   of where we came from is
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.160]   there was a big bang
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]   and we came from nothing.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.160]   So it was magic.
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.160]   If you believe
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.160]   that God created you,
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.160]   you're unscientific
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.160]   and you're illogical
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.160]   and you're foolish.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   So if you really want to be smart,
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.160]   you have to believe
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.160]   nothing created you
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   because that's more logical.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.160]   The best scientists
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   in our generation,
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   that's their answer
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160]   because we have been
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   separated from our Creator.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   And we live our days
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   every single day
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160]   just getting in this line.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.160]   Line of life.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   You're supposed to go to school.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   Go to college.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160]   Get good grades
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   so you can get a good job.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   And then what?
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160]   So you can get married.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160]   And then what?
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   And you have kids.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.160]   And then what?
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.160]   And then you climb the ladder
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.160]   and you make a better job,
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   a better money,
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160]   a better house.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.160]   And then what?
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.160]   You save up enough money
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160]   so you can retire.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.160]   And then what?
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.160]   And then you die.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.160]   That's it?
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   All that we're doing,
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   that's it?
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   We're just going to work hard
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   and I don't like my job
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   and stress.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.160]   You know, this is it?
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.160]   We don't know the answer
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.160]   because we have fallen
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.160]   short of the Creator
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160]   because we've been lost
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.160]   because we did it our way.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160]   Not only does it separate us
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.160]   from God,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   Scripture tells us
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.160]   it isolates us from each other.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.160]   First thing that happens
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.160]   when sin enters,
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   Adam and Eve
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   recognize their shame
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160]   and who do they hide from?
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.160]   From each other.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.160]   So imagine two people
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160]   who were created
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   to procreate together,
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.160]   to rule the land together,
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.160]   now because shame
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   and sin has entered,
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.160]   they're trying to hide
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160]   from each other.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   Even in the best of marriages,
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160]   even in the best of marriages,
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.160]   communication is difficult.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160]   It's difficult because
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   I don't want to reveal
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160]   everything to you.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.160]   Even though my wife
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.160]   knows me better
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.160]   than any other human being,
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.160]   there's things
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   that I don't want her to know.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.160]   There's things
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   that she doesn't want me to know.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   Sin enters into
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160]   what God has created
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.160]   and makes it difficult.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160]   James 4.1, it says,
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160]   "What is the source
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   of quarrels and conflicts among you?
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.160]   Is not the source
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.160]   your pleasures that wage war
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.160]   in your members?"
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.160]   All the conflict,
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.160]   all the difficulty, heartache.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   Isn't it because of sin,
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.160]   your coveting,
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160]   your desire?
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.160]   Because you want to do it your way
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.160]   and the other person
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.160]   wants to do it their way
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   and they have conflict.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   James 3.16,
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160]   "For where jealousy
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.160]   and selfish ambition exist,
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.160]   there is disorder
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.160]   in every evil thing."
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   We live in a world
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   where everybody wants
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   to do it their own way.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160]   And so where that happens
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   between husband and wife,
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.160]   there's conflict.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.160]   Wherever two selfish people
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.160]   get together,
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   try to do anything together,
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   there's going to be
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   some conflict.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160]   You put that
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.160]   in a larger scale
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.160]   of countries, families.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   And so the whole world
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.160]   is under this condemnation
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   and his main rebellion is,
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.160]   "I'm going to do
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.160]   what I think is right
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   and what makes me
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   the most happy."
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   And in his pursuit
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   of his own pleasure
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   and his own life
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.160]   and his own glory,
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   instead of bringing life,
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   it has brought judgment.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   And ultimately, it says,
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   it leads to death.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   Romans 6.23,
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160]   "For the wages of sin
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]   is death."
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   James 1.15,
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   "Then when lust
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   has conceived,
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.160]   when coveting has conceived,
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.160]   it gives birth to sin.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.160]   When sin is accomplished,
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.160]   it brings forth death."
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.080]   There is a physical death
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   and then there is
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.080]   a spiritual death,
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.080]   a second death.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.080]   Death was not part
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.080]   of creation,
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   even though this
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080]   is the experience
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   of every single human being
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.080]   who has ever lived
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.080]   on this earth
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   has experienced death.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080]   So because that
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.080]   is our experience,
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.080]   our natural inclination
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   is to say,
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   "It's part of life."
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080]   Think about that statement.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.080]   Death is a part of life.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.080]   That's a contradiction.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   Death is a part of life?
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   No.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080]   Death is a contradiction
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   to life.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080]   Death is not part of life.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.080]   We say death
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   is a part of life
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080]   because there is no answer
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.080]   to this death.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080]   But death is not
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080]   part of life.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.080]   That's not what God intended.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080]   God intended for us
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.080]   to have life
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.080]   and have this life abundantly,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.080]   but death came in
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   as a result
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   of perverting every good thing
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   that God had created.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080]   And as a result of that,
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.080]   it says,
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   "Inasmuch as it is appointed
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.080]   for all men to die once
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   because of a sin,
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.080]   after this will come judgment."
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.080]   I'm going to read you
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.080]   a long quote
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.080]   from Steve Jobs, right?
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.080]   The creator of this, okay?
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.080]   As you guys know,
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080]   he died pretty young
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.080]   because of cancer
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080]   and at the age of 56,
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.080]   he had plenty of time
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.080]   to contemplate
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   the position that he was in
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080]   and then he wrote a memoir
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   and some of his last words
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.080]   have been recorded
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.080]   and I'm not surprised
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   that not many people
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080]   have read it
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.080]   because it's not a happy letter.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080]   It doesn't make your life better.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.080]   He's just matter of fact
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.080]   stating this
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.080]   and this is what he says.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   "I reached the pinnacle of success
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   in the business world.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   In others' eyes,
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080]   my life is the epitome of success.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.080]   However, aside from work,
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.080]   I have little joy.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.080]   In the end,
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   my wealth is only a fact of life
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   that I am accustomed to.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.080]   At this moment,
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.080]   lying on my bed
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.080]   and recalling my life,
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.080]   I realized
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.080]   that all the recognition
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.080]   and wealth
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.080]   that I took so much pride in
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.080]   have paled
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.080]   and becoming meaningless
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.080]   in the face of my death.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   You can employ someone
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.080]   to drive the car for you,
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.080]   make money for you,
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.080]   but you cannot have someone
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.080]   bear your sickness for you.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080]   Material things,
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.080]   loss can be found
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.080]   or replaced
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   but there is one thing
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.080]   that can never be found
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.080]   when it is lost,
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.080]   life.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   Whichever stage in life
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.080]   you're in right now,
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.080]   with time,
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   you will face the day
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.080]   when the curtain falls.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.080]   You can see why
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.080]   so many things about Steve Jobs
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.080]   are recorded,
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.080]   books written
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.080]   about what kind of manager he was,
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.080]   how he changed the world
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.080]   with all this new technology
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   and yet
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   the most important thing
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.080]   that he has said
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.080]   in his life
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.080]   at his death,
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.080]   very few people know
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.080]   because they don't want to hear it.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   They don't want to face reality.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.080]   This is reality.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.080]   You may never experience
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.080]   even one percent
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.080]   of the success
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   that Steve Jobs had
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.080]   but every single person
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.080]   at some point in life
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   will come
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.080]   to realize what he says
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   and experience
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   the exact thing
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   that he wrote.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   So when the scripture says
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.080]   that the sun is going to come,
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   Yahweh, our creator
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   is going to come save us
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   from our sins.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.080]   This is the most important thing
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   that we have to answer
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   for ourselves.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.080]   Is the creator real
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080]   or did we just come out
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.080]   of nothing?
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   That if we keep studying science
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   eventually
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.080]   everything is going
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.080]   to make sense
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.080]   or were we truly created
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080]   and this creator
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080]   had a plan
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.080]   for our lives
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   and we lived in rebellion.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.080]   I did it my way.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.080]   Did this creator really come
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.080]   and bear our sins
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080]   upon himself?
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   In fact,
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   what Steve Jobs has said
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.080]   has been said
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.080]   multiple times,
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   thousands of times.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   People who have gone
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   before us
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080]   hundreds of years,
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   thousands of years before us
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080]   have said
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   the exact same thing
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.080]   at the end of their life.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   Ecclesiastes chapter 1
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.080]   verse 2 to 4
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080]   there is a man
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   named Solomon
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080]   who was considered
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.080]   the wisest man on earth
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080]   but not only was he wise
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080]   he was rich.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080]   Not only was he wise
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   and rich
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.080]   he was powerful.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.080]   He was a king.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.080]   So there is nothing
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.080]   nothing restraining him.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.080]   So all the pleasure
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.080]   all the things
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   that he could possibly
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]   experience as a king
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   as the wealth that he had
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.080]   and the wisdom that he had
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.080]   he pursued all his life
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.080]   to experience life
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.080]   to do it his way.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   At the end of his life
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   he writes
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   "Vanity, vanity
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   says the preacher
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   vanity of vanities
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080]   all is vanity
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.080]   what advantage
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.080]   does man have
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080]   in all his work
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.080]   which he does under the sun
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   a generation goes
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080]   and a generation comes
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.080]   but the earth remains forever
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.080]   vanity
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080]   all is vanity.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   Let me ask you a question
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   how many of you
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.080]   know the name
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.080]   of your great-grandparents?
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.080]   A few of you might
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.080]   a few of you might
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   maybe some of you
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080]   your great-grandparents
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080]   lived a little bit longer
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.080]   and maybe
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.080]   they told
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.080]   you had a good relationship
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.080]   with them
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.080]   and they told you stories
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   about their parents
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.080]   and so as a result
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.080]   of that some of you may know.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   From my experience
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.080]   majority of you
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.080]   have no idea who they are.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.080]   If great-grandparents
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.080]   but at least
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.080]   even above that
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.080]   right
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   for sure they don't know.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   You don't know their personality
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.080]   you don't even know their name
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.080]   you don't know where they were born
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.080]   you don't know
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.080]   what kind of job they had
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080]   you don't know
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   whatever was good
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   whatever was bad
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.080]   you just don't know
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   right
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   which means
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.080]   in about a hundred years
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.080]   no one's gonna know
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.080]   you were here
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.080]   in about a hundred years
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.080]   no one's gonna even remember
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.080]   like oh
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080]   was Peter Kim
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   even alive?
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   Did he exist?
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.080]   The Bible says
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.080]   that we're just a mist
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   in comparison
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   to even just human history
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   we're just a mist
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   that comes and we go.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.080]   In two generations
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.080]   no one's even gonna know
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   you and I were here
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   and in between
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.080]   this short period of life
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080]   if we live long
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   ninety
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080]   ninety years
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   a hundred years
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   if we live short
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   much less than that
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   we try so hard
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.080]   to fill this short gap
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.080]   to do whatever we want
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   how meaningless life is
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   when you
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.080]   consider
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   take a step back
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080]   and consider
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080]   what we are a part of
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.080]   it is because
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.080]   we have been separated
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   from this God
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.080]   the very purpose
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.080]   that you and I have been created
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   to be worshippers
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.080]   and not to be worshipped
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.080]   now some of that may say
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.080]   well God's an egomaniac
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   well he wants to be worshipped
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.080]   rather than
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   rather than to give worship
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.080]   let me ask you
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   when do you feel
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.080]   the most alive?
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.080]   Like some of you guys
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   who are sports fans
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.080]   right
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.080]   like it's easy
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   because
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   you pay
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.080]   a ridiculous amount of money
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.080]   to go see
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.080]   Shohei Otani
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   right
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.080]   a ridiculous
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.080]   I heard that
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.080]   their baseball tickets
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.080]   his opening day
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.080]   I forgot who they were playing
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   I forgot how much it was
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.000]   but now
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   standing room only
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   right
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   not sitting
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   to stand
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   and watch this guy
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   play
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   in a Dodgers uniform
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   for the first time
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   the cheapest tickets
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   is $900
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   I don't know
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   if that's going to go up or down
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   but I guarantee you
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   they're going to sell
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   every single ticket they have
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   why do they do that?
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   What do they get out of it?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   Do they
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   is there a possibility
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   that they're going to get signed
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   to Dodgers?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   Are they going to become famous?
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   Like what?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   What is it?
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   Because they find pleasure
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.000]   in seeing glory
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   they find pleasure
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   in watching something
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   spectacular beyond them
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   if I play baseball
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   nobody cares
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   because it's not spectacular
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   you're going to say
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   I could do that
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   my sister could do that
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   right
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   but there's something
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   about seeing something
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   beyond us
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   that gives us life
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   and this is just
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   a human being
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   that just plays baseball
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   better than
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   a little bit better than
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.000]   most average people
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   maybe a little bit more
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   than a little bit better
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   but he's just another
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   human being
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   playing baseball
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   God created us
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   to be image bearers
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   of him
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   and that our life
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   comes when we
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   reflect his glory
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   so imagine
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   if you feel life
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   watching a human
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   baseball player
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   playing better than
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   any other person
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   imagine what we're missing
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   when the Bible says
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   all have sinned
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.000]   and fall short
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   of the glory of God
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   because of our sins
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   we're unable
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   to worship him
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   we're unable
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   to see him
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   and as a result of that
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   we don't know
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   what this life is about
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   and we're trying
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   to bring meaning
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   into life
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   and Christ came
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   so that he may
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   bear the sin
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   that you and I
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   cannot bear
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   to absorb our sins
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   upon himself
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   on the cross
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.000]   when he died
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   when he was resurrected
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   he pushes back
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   against the curse
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   of mankind
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   and gives us
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   new life
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   in Christ
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   that's what
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   we are celebrating
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   in Christmas
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   Emmanuel
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   the son of God
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   who would have been
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   perfectly justified
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   to crush us
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   but instead
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   had compassion
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   and took on human form
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   that he may be
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   a sympathetic high priest
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   and then invites us
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   to come to him
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.000]   Jesus said 2,000 years ago
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   come to me
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   all who are weary
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   and heavy laden
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   and I will give you rest
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   the reason why
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   there is unrest
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   in our lives
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   is not because
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   of our broken families
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   it's not because
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   of economy
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   it's not because
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   you bought the house
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   at the wrong time
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   it's not because
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   of a communication problem
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   all of these things
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   are symptoms
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   of spiritual cancer
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   in us
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   our own sins
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   come to me
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   all who are weary
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   those of you
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.000]   who are anxious
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   who are hurting
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   and you don't
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   have any answer to this
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   the only answer
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   to our real problem
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   is Christ
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   come to Christ
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   all who are weary
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   and heavy laden
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   and I will give you rest
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   take my work upon you
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   and learn from me
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   for I am gentle
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   and humble in heart
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   and you will find
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   true Sabbath
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   you will find true rest
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   for your souls
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:50.920]   if this morning
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.920]   you came
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.920]   maybe you just came
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:54.920]   you know
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.920]   you wanted to see
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.920]   your grandchildren
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.920]   or your nephews
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.920]   or it's Christmas
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920]   so it's a habit
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.920]   like you come
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.920]   at least once a year
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.920]   try to do something good
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.920]   you know
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:06.920]   at least try to
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   maybe your children
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   or somebody
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.920]   that really cares
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.920]   about you
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   have been praying
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   and you didn't want
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.920]   to let them down
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   you came here
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.920]   however you came
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.920]   however you came
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920]   I believe
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.920]   God had his own plan for you
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:23.920]   if any of this
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.920]   makes any sense to you
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.920]   don't harden your heart
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:29.920]   do you really believe
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920]   we came from nothing
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920]   and we go to nothing
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920]   that everything
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.920]   that we do is meaningless
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.920]   and we're just going to die
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.920]   and that's just life
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   and we just happen
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.920]   to be in this line
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920]   and everybody else
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920]   gets in this line
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   and this is it
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.920]   that's the meaning of life
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920]   all of it
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920]   that's it
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.920]   or was there a creator
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.840]   was there a creator
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.840]   who created you
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840]   and you
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.840]   don't know who he is
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.840]   you've never talked to him
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   you maybe thought about him
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   and you've concluded
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840]   without giving it much thought
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   even if he exists
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   I'm not going to know
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   and you've already made
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   a conclusion
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   without ever giving it a try
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.840]   I want to plead with you
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.840]   reconcile with God
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.840]   reconcile with God
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840]   in 1st John 1:9 says
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   if we confess our sins
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.840]   he is faithful and righteous
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840]   to forgive us our sins
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840]   and cleanse us
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   from all unrighteousness
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.840]   our greatest problem
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   of mankind
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840]   is we refuse
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.840]   refuse to acknowledge
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.840]   that we've gone astray
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.840]   and as a result of that
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.840]   it blinds us
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.840]   but the scripture tells us
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840]   that if you would humble yourself
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.760]   confess your sin
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   acknowledge
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.760]   acknowledge
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   the sin inside of you
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   and confess with your mouth
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.760]   that Christ died
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   and was resurrected for your sin
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   and ask for forgiveness
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   he is faithful and just
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   to make you righteous
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   to open your eyes
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   to see
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   that there is much more
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.760]   to your existence
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.760]   much more to your afterlife
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.760]   than what you have been imagining
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.760]   to come to Christ this morning
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   come to Christ this morning
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.760]   I beg of you
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   I beg of you
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.760]   come to Christ this morning
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   there is nothing
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   nothing
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   more important
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   there is no greater question
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:37.760]   for you to answer
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.760]   before you pass away
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:42.760]   to answer that question
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.760]   would God be real
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.760]   I'm telling you
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760]   with all my heart
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   God is real
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   we didn't come from nothing
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.760]   God created us
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.760]   he loved us
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.760]   he sent his only son
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   to die for us
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.760]   please receive his forgiveness
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.760]   be saved
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.760]   and come to Christ
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   would you take a minute
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:18.760]   to pray for me
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.760]   Father
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.760]   Lord
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.760]   I pray for your mercy
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.760]   I pray Lord God
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.760]   as you've been merciful to us
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760]   that you would be merciful
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.760]   to the souls in this room
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:38.760]   Lord my words are not enough
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   Lord our songs are not enough
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.680]   everything that we come short of
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   you promised that your Holy Spirit
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   would make it clear
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680]   I pray that as you promised
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.680]   that your word would go forth
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   and will not return
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.680]   until it has accomplished
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.680]   the purpose you have ordained
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.680]   I pray that you would open
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.680]   many people's eyes
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.680]   that they would see
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   that these are not empty words
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.680]   that this is the truth
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680]   that you are the Alpha
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   and the Omega
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.680]   you are our creator
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.680]   you are our salvation
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.680]   I pray Father God
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.680]   that you would be merciful
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.680]   I pray for the believers
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]   in this room Lord God
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.680]   that you would shake up our core
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.680]   to know that there is nothing
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.680]   more worth living for
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.680]   than to share this gospel
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:25.680]   to the world
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.680]   as we celebrate
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   the birth of your son Jesus
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   restore in us
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.680]   the joy of our salvation
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.680]   that Christ's name may be exalted
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.680]   that the lost may hear
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.680]   the voice of their master
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.680]   and that many many souls
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.680]   will come to know the Savior
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.680]   and be adopted into your family
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.680]   in Jesus name we pray, Amen
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.680]   would you all stand up
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.680]   for the closing praise
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:10.600]   [music]
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.600]   You are faithful God
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.600]   You can unstable God
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:25.600]   No you are not alone
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.520]   Oh God, bearing and waiting
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:35.520]   Lord, bury your praying heart
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:42.520]   See what your God hath done
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.520]   Christ is born
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:50.520]   Christ is born
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.520]   Christ is born
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:06.520]   [music]
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.520]   You are unbroken heart
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   His fears unspoken heart
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:19.520]   Just who is broken heart
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:23.520]   [music]
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.520]   Empty and blinded
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   There is no need to worry
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:38.520]   See what your God hath done
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:42.520]   Christ is born
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.520]   Christ is born
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   Christ is born
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:57.520]   [music]
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   The man who was given
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.520]   Slain for our pardon
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.520]   His promise is peace
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.520]   For those who believe
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   He's the man who was given
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:22.520]   Slain for our pardon
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   His promise is peace
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.520]   For those who believe
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.520]   He's the man who was given
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.520]   Slain for our pardon
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:43.520]   His promise is peace
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.520]   For those who believe
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.520]   He's the man who was given
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.520]   Slain for our pardon
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   His promise is peace
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   For those who believe
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.520]   [music]
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:12.520]   So come, though you have nothing
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.520]   Come, he is the offering
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:23.520]   Come, see what your God has done
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:28.520]   Christ is born
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.520]   Christ is born
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.520]   Christ is born
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   For you
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.520]   [music]
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520]   Before I pray, I wanted to...
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:49.520]   Our outreach team has a table set up outside,
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   so as soon as you go outside to the right,
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.520]   one of our pastor, Pastor Mark,
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.520]   and the outreach team is going to be stationed there,
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   so if you have any questions, anything that you've heard,
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   or I think they may have some also materials to help you
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   if you have any questions, so if you can go outside.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   As soon as you go outside to your right side,
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520]   if you visit that table, they'll be able to help you
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.520]   with any questions that you may have, okay?
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.520]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll sing our final closing song
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.520]   and we'll finish for today.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   Father, we thank you for what this day means
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.520]   to all of us and to the world,
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   that in the midst of the darkness
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   that you have come to shed light, Lord God,
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:30.520]   that we may see truth and follow you.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:34.520]   I pray, Father, that as many of the minds
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.520]   of the unbelieving has been blinded
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.520]   so that they may not see the glory
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.520]   I pray that as you have promised,
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   as you built your church and the gates of Hades
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.520]   will not be able to prevail against it,
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.520]   that that would be true today,
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.520]   that no amount of darkness
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.520]   will be able to fight off the tremendous light
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.520]   that you are able to shine.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.520]   May your glory, your love, your holiness,
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.520]   your patience, your mercy, your kindness
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.520]   shed light on this truth
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.520]   that more and more people, Lord God,
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:18.520]   would know and live and die
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   with the hope that can only be found
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.520]   in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.520]   Amen.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:29.520]   As we sing this last song,
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.520]   we're going to sing this ending song
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.520]   with a Christmas song.
