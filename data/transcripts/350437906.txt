[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome to BBS Kids. This year we're introducing some new characters.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   To our right is Detective Friday and Sammy of the BIS, the Marine Investigative Services.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Detective Friday and Sammy are trying to keep busy around the office. They haven't had a case in years.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   To our left lives Mrs. Buttersworth. She's been travel camping through Redwood National Forest
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and is making her way back to Miami, Florida. Look at all the boxes she's unpacking for her trip.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Let's join them to find out what happens next.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Oh, oh Sammy. We haven't had a case in years. I mean we're supposed to be detectives but,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I mean look at us. Our whole office is so dirty. And look at our trophies covered in dust.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Dust and shiny dust. I mean it's so dusty. I think it's time for you to get the Swiffer
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and just start dusting while I look through some cases that are interesting for us, you know?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Hey ma'am. I don't know. I just heard this bug crash while I was looking at some bobcats
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   in the area and found you here. Oh my stuff. Who would do such a thing? It's everywhere.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Where's my treasure? Where's my treasure? Treasure? Um. Oh, nature's glowing.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Wait, where are you going? Where's my treasure? You know, what is my treasure?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Okay, okay, you know. Detective Joe. Detective Friday.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Hello? Private Investigator Friday opens five days a week starting Friday.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Nice. Thanks for calling. Hi, my name is Mrs. Wattersworth and you know,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I've seen you lost something of great importance to me, you know, actually a treasure really.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Wait, a treasure? Are we talking about a treasure? Like fine china or maybe even jewelry?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   No, no, no. It's much more important to me than that. Do you think we can meet in person?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Sure. How did you hear about us? Actually, you know, I heard a bit from a friend of a friend
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   named Detective Joe at the Irma Police Department. Oh, okay. Detective Joe. Great.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I'll let you know our estimated time of arrival. Great. See you soon.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Alright, let's go.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We're finally here.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Wait, and you are? Hi, I'm Mrs. Wattersworth.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Oh, hi. My name is Detective Nemesis, I mean, Detective Friday and this is my mini, I mean, my assistant, Sammy.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Hey, so what happened? Why did you call us here?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Okay, well, you know, I was cleaning up some stuff around my campsite and I kind of tripped on some boxes
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   because I fell. But then, you know, I can't find my treasure and I think I must have hit my head kind of hard
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   because I don't even remember what my treasure is. That's why I called.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Oh, thanks for calling. I mean, we can help look for your treasure right now. I mean, that's what we do.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Okay, good. Alright, perfect. Let's go. Let's get started.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Is it this? No.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Wait, I don't know what this is, but this has to be it.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I don't know if that is even actually.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   What about this? No, but I'm actually looking for this. Thank you.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Wait, I found it. It's a shoe.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's not even mine.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Oh. Oh.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Oh my gosh, I found it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   No, that's not it either.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   That has to be it. Look at how big that diamond is.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   You know, it's not even that big.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Can I have it back?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   No, I didn't say you could have it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Wait, so if it's not that huge diamond and it's not that weird looking shoe,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   then when was the last time you saw this treasure of yours?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Actually, I was moving some stuff and then putting it here and then over there and then.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Oh, I forgot one more spot.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Oh my gosh, sea flower princess pretty.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Is it going to have any fruits?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Actually, yeah, it's going to have the sweetest and the brightest fruit ever.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Wait, what kind of seed is she used for? I mean, look at how it's growing these flowers out.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah, you know, it's from a bubblegum tree.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Yeah, you know, it grows in East Africa, actually.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   East Africa, huh?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, and when it first begins to grow or when they first plant it,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   the seed is super small, like super duper small.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It's as tiny as a mustard seed, but then it grows so fast.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You know, I actually grew this yesterday.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Wait, what?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Did I hear you say that right?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You grew that tree from this small mustard seed to that tree in one night?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   How is that possible?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It must be the water. The only thing that can grow that fast is the water.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   No, it's not the water.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   What?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It's not even the seed. It's actually the soil.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   The soil, that's it? Wait, the soil is your treasure?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You're funny.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So you can't just dive down and what, like dive in it or something?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   No, soil is not my treasure. It's a clue, though.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Wait, I think I just solved it.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Or just kidding, I think I just found the clue.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I think the clue is the soil.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Good job, Detective May.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I just said that.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I can't wait to see what I will find next time.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   [music]
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The end.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   [applause]
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   [children talking]
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It has been quite an interesting day so far.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Mrs. Buttersworth, a wealthy lady, has forgotten where she's placed her most prized possession
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   after she tripped on her shoelaces and injured her head with a bunch of boxes.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   All alone and with no memory of where she has been placed her true treasure,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   she hires a team of professional detectives.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Detective Friday and Sammy have come from the big city in their trusty car
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   to Redwood National Park to help.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Will they be one step closer to finding Mrs. Buttersworth's missing treasure?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Let's find out.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Have you found anything?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   No, I haven't really found anything yet.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Hmm, I love this.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Hmm, this is interesting.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Interesting, have you found anything yet?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Are you jealous?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I haven't found anything.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Oh, there it is.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Are you okay?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I'm okay.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Where's Detective Friday?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Hey, good to see you.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Do you want to help me look for treasure?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Hey guys, any luck?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I haven't found anything, but I met this person.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He's helping me.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   She's Detective Friday.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Oh yes.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I see you found my wig.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Yes, I found that wig.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I thought it matched my mustache quite well actually.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   But this is me.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   There's just so many boxes here.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I don't think we're able to go through all of these boxes to find the treasure.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I think we need to split up and look for it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   What do you guys think?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Yes!
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Okay.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Oh, I found something.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   What's this box?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's got Uncle Mortimer on it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   That's my Uncle Mortimer stuff.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Mortimer?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I think I have a portrait of him somewhere.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Wait, what's inside?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   What?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   What's behind this?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Oh, Uncle Mortimer, there you are.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You're so dirty.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   [Mortimer laughing]
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   You know what?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   You know, Uncle Mortimer lived quite an interesting life and at one point, a very reckless life.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Here, I'll tell you his story.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   [Mortimer laughing]
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Uncle Mortimer is my great uncle.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   He came from a very wealthy family.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   His father was kind, honest, and just.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Unfortunately, one day, his daughter found out he had a bad friend and decided she no longer wanted to live in his father's house.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So, he went to his father and demanded for an inheritance.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   It went way like this.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Oh, my son, what a pleasure to see you. Something up the matter?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Father, I want my inheritance money.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I want to see the world.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I want to eat fine dining.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I want to live my life.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Son, it's a dangerous world out there.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You must be careful. Don't be reckless.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Father, I want my money now.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Money.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Mula.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Monero.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Chedda.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Oh, fine dining.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Fine.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Gasol, I will take one of these sprinkled beauties.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So delicate, so delicious.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   More food?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Yes. Yes, more food.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Very delicious.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I have to pay first.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Very tasty.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yes.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   More, more, more.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   It's got a deadly flavor.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's great.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Yes.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Let me get it.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Let me get it.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I've got no more money.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Unfortunately, Uncle Molo spent his money on fine dining.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   He soon found himself homeless and living on the street.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Eating food thrown out of the restaurant.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Trash.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Oh, it's food.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   This fish doesn't even have any meat on this bone.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Oh, an apple.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Somebody ate it.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Pizza, pizza.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   It smells like cardboard.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   A donut.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   A sprinkled beauty.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Somebody ate it.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And there's a hair on it.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And a bug.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I'm going to eat it anyways because I'm so hungry.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Finally, Uncle Mortimer knew what he had to do.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He had to go home.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   He knew what he had done was wrong.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And he was very ashamed.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But he remembered his father.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   What am I doing?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I'm hungry.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'm dirty.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I'm homeless.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   I need to apologize.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   I need to say sorry to my dad.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I could work for him as a servant.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I don't deserve to be a son.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I will go find him.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I will go back home.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Uncle Mortimer's father had been searching for him this whole time.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   When he saw his son at a distance, he ran to meet him.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   There he is.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   My son, you are home.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Father!
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I missed you.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I missed you, Father.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Oh, yes, I am so famished.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You know what this reminds me of?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It reminds me of the prodigal son.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   The prodigal son.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   That's it.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's another clue.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   You know, before we start looking again,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I'm going to celebrate us finding the second clue with another cup of tea.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   All right.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Man, that was crazy.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I can't believe the story of Uncle Mortimer.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Man, he stole all of his father's money and he spent it all in one day.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   How crazy is that?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Yeah, I can't believe his father welcomed him back after all of that.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I mean, I think he's really mad.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   You know, I kind of wish I had a father like that.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I mean, even though I did all of those bad things
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   and still my father is just an--I mean, such an unconditional lover, you know?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I wish I had somebody that could just love me unconditionally like that.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I don't think I've ever met a person who loves someone like that.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You know, you're right.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I mean, unfortunately, we weren't able to solve
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   or find Mrs. B's treasure today,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   but luckily we were able to find the first clue yesterday with the soil.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And today we found our second clue, which was the prodigal son.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Man, hopefully we find our treasure tomorrow.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   [music]
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Spend the night in the woods.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   We've discovered two clues so far, the seed and the soil on day one,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   the story of the prodigal son, Uncle Mortimer, on day two.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   The detectives still haven't discovered what this treasure is, but they're determined.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Sammy can't seem to sleep this morning.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   After what they discovered yesterday,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   she's really stuck on finding out what the treasure is.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Will today be the day they find out Mrs. Buttersworth's treasure,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   or will we simply find more clues?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Let's find out.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   [snoring]
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   [yawns]
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Top of the morning, Sammy.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Looks like you beat the sun.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I was just trying to figure out where Mrs. B's treasure could be.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Sammy, Sammy, the only way to really start the morning
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   is with a box of sprinkle beauties.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Donuts! Who wants one? You want one?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Donut for you! Donut for you! We've got all kinds!
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I mean, I mean, it must be really amazing.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   She has all of this stuff, but it means nothing to her compared to this treasure.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   You're telling me?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Maybe I should just take a break. I'm so tired.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I love this place. It's so quiet.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Yeah, it's pretty beautiful.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   You know what goes well with a beautiful place like this?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   A box of sprinkle beauties! Let's get another one!
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Really?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   [screams]
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Right there! There's a bug! There's a bug on you!
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   There's a bug! There's a bug!
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I got it! I got it! I got it!
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Oh, oh, it's just a bug.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Don't worry, I got it off you.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Sorry, Sammy, let me help you up.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Here, have another donut to replenish your energy.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   You sure?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Suit yourself.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   These are some of the best donuts I've had in my life.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Seriously, I mean, talk about perfection.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   In donuts, there's sprinkles and there's glaze.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And then more sprinkles and then glaze.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And then sprinkles!
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Where did my donut go?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Huh? Look, Detective, it's a cute little kitty.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Oh my gosh!
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Sammy! Sammy!
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   [screams]
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Oh my gosh! Sammy, are you okay?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Sit right here.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Man, I'm having a rough day already.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Tell you what, I'm going to go look for my lost donut.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And why don't you sit here, okay?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   [screams]
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Oh my gosh, what happened here?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I've been attacked by these creatures!
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I guess they thought I was an octopus and a bug.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Oh, you know, did that vicious cat attack you?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Ugh, you know, his appearances can be very deceiving.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Yes, and this octopus would have attacked me too.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   You think Bubbles would have attacked you?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Oh, no, no, Bubbles is such a gentle dog.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   [bubbling]
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Oh, my donut. Thank you.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   You know, Bubbles has such a kind heart.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   [gasps]
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   The heart! You know, that's another clue!
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   [music]
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   [applause]
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Give our script team a big hand!
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   [applause]
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Yesterday, Detective Friday and Sammy weren't aware of the creatures that lived in the woods with Mrs. Butterworth.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Who would have thought that an innocent-looking cat could be such a grub,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and a big, slimy octopus be a gentle, loving creature?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Detective Friday and Sammy learned that it was the heart that showed the true nature inside each of us.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Will Sam and Friday finally discover the treasure their heart is seeking after?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   [laughing]
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Sammy, there you are.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It's awfully dangerous out here.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Did you bring the special stuff?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Right here, boss.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Good. Let's go.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Okay.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Do you see anything?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   No. You?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I see him. He's just looking at me.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   [music]
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   [screams]
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Sammy, you scared me!
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   What are you doing?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I don't know. What are you doing?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Oh, my goodness!
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   [screams]
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Where is he?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Oh, my goodness!
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Not you, monster!
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Sammy, hit him!
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Hit him, Sammy! Hit him with the frying pan!
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   That's right. You got it good.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Is it dead?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   [screams]
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   It's... this is Butterworth.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   What are you doing out here?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   You need to be careful.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   There are dangerous creatures out here,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   such as wombats, button bugs, and frying pans.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   [laughing]
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   No.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Oh, my goodness. My puzzle.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Oh, no. Oh, no.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Here, we'll help you.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   We'll help you put it together.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Don't worry. We can do it.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   [chatter]
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   You know, it's okay.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I can picture on my phone what the puzzle used to look like.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   [chatter]
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   You know...
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Whoa.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Geez, things really fly around here.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Anyways, you know...
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   [sigh]
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Something just...
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I'm bored as a leaf frog.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Oh, good find.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Anyways, you know,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   this puzzle was a gift from my grandma,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   who's a Christian.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   You know, when I was younger,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   she used to read me stories from the Bible.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   You guys know the Barbers, right?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Oh, that song.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   The Bible.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   That's that TV show.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Oh, yeah!
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   The one with all the vegetables.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   No, that's a legend, you know.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   It's not the Bible.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Oh.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   But anyways, you know,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   the Bible talks about God
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and his plan to restore the relationship
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   between him and his creation.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   [chatter]
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But you know,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   mankind sinned,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and so now...
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   No, the first man sinned,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   so now all mankind are sinners.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   You know, we're lawbreakers, thieves, and liars,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   but we're without hope and without rest.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Even a little fuzzy lie?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Well, you know,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   a little lie is still a lie against a holy God.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   But we can always just try our best
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   and be the worst-becoming person.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Unfortunately, Sammy,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   good works is not enough.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   We have sin inside of us,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   so everything we do is stained by our sin.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   The punishment for sin is death.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Either we or a sacrifice must die
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   to take the sins away from us.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Um...
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Yes, that one goes right there.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Yes.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Perfect.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   But you know,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   God had a plan,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   so he sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross for us
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   to take away our sins.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Jesus Christ is known as the Good Shepherd,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and we are known as sheep.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   When he calls, we follow.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I think we have every move now.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Just three more.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   One...
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Two...
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Three.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Three!
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Perfect!
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Yay! We did it!
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   What is it?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   "For where your treasure is,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   there your heart will be also."
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Matthew 6, 21.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Guys, this is the final clue!
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Good job, guys.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   You know, it's kind of late, though.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I think I'm going to turn in.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Alrighty.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Good night!
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Good night.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Thank you again.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Good night.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Do you think we're any closer to finding our treasure?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Hmm...
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Hard to say.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Hmm...
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   What do you think about what she said, though?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   If everything we do is stained by our sin
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and our hard work could never be enough,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   then we could never be made friends with God.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   What do we do now?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   [Children singing]
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Follow Jesus?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Sammy, do you think I can do this?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Hmm...
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   [Music]
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   [Applause]
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Alright, kids.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Detective Brian and Sammy have been looking everywhere,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and we still haven't found the clues.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Hi, Miss Narrator.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Um, we're just a little bit confused.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   So we've been thinking about what the treasure is,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and we just can't figure it out.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Do you think we can get some help?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Yeah, it would be really nice if we could, like,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   find some kids who have maybe, like,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   gone to BBS or something, you know?
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Hmm...
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I guess we went to BBS.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Oh, you guys can help us!
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Can you guys help us find the treasure?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   [Applause]
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Thank you.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Alright, join the team. Come on.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Now, you guys gotta keep it down, though,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   because Mrs. Buttersworth is sleeping.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   She can't wake up.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   So, where should we start?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Well, what was the first clue?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   [Children shouting]
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   A bear? Where?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I don't like bears.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Oh, it's okay, Detective. Come back.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   It looks like a nice, friendly bear.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Hi, Mr. Bear.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Do you want to help us?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Yeah, I think you can help us.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Oh!
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   The soil!
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   You're right.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   The Word of God is like the seed,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   and a person's heart is like the soil.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Yes.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   The good and strong soil
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   produces good and strong fruits, remember?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Hmm...
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Well, then...
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   What's the second clue?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   [Children shouting]
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Oh, yeah! Uncle Mortimer!
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And the prodigal son!
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   [Children shouting]
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I'm a sinner, remember?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I sinned against the Holy God.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   But I've been forgiven because I repented.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Great job, kids.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   If we have a ready heart and repent and leave our sin,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   we can find forgiveness, too.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   So, then...
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   What's clue number three?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   [Children shouting]
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   The donut!
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   The donut's clue number three!
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Wait, what?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Yeah, right?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Oh, wait...
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Never mind.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Oh! But what's the word?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   A good heart produces good fruits,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   but a bad heart produces bad, grumpy cat fruit.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   That's right. It was the heart.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Hmm...
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And then, I think there was one more.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   What was clue number four?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   [Children shouting]
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Oh!
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Clue number four was my puzzle, remember?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Oh!
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Matthew 6, 21.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Matthew 6, 19-20.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   "Do not lay up for yourselves treasure on earth,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   where moth and rust destroy,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and what these break-ins do.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   But lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven."
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Treasure!
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Treasure's in heaven!
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   That's it!
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   The kingdom of heaven!
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Yeah, because the treasure is greater than anything found on earth.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Thus, the treasure must be the kingdom of heaven!
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   We found the treasure!
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Let's go!
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   [Cheering]
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Oh!
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   (LAUGHTER)
