[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   If you can turn your Bibles to Psalm chapter 90, we're going to be reading from verse 1-12.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.400]   Our focus is on the second part of the sermon series in chapter 90.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.520]   I'm going to be focusing on the second part, verses 7-12.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.880]   The first part was "Look up."
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.160]   This week it's going to be "Looking in" and next week it's going to be "Looking out."
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.400]   I want to read starting from verse 1.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.160]   Lord you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.520]   Before the mountains were born, you gave birth to the earth and the world.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.240]   Even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.040]   You turn man back into dust and say, "Return, O children of men."
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.280]   For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it passes by.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.640]   You are as a watch in the night.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.360]   You have swept them away like a flood.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360]   They fall asleep.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240]   In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.080]   In the morning it flourishes and sprouts anew.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.760]   Toward evening it fades and withers away.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.920]   For we have been consumed by your anger and by your wrath we have been dismayed.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.300]   You have placed our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.160]   For all our days have declined in your fury.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.720]   We have finished our years like a sigh.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.120]   As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years or of due strength, eighty years.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.720]   Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.460]   For soon it is gone and we fly away.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.680]   Who understands the power of your anger and your fury according to the fear that is due
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   you?
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.280]   So teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.680]   Let's pray.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.280]   Heavenly Father, we pray that as we face the new year in 2019, we ask Lord God as the
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.200]   psalmist asks that we would number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.840]   That we may live Lord God not to spend our days but to invest it for the things that
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.760]   count for eternity.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.480]   We ask Lord you give us soberness, a deeper understanding of who you are, where we stand
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.280]   before you, that we may not drift Lord God from year to year, from month to month.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.980]   Help us Lord to run with a clear purpose and clear aim.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.840]   So we ask for your direction and your Holy Spirit to speak to us through your word.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.760]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   Amen.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.560]   Again, as a quick review, the reason why we're taking some time in Psalm 90 before we jump
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.780]   into the book of Hebrews is because again as we concluded 2018 and we're facing new
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.520]   year in 2019, Psalm 90 was an appropriate text for us to spend some time in.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.540]   Moses is about to lead the nation of Israel into the promised land.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.400]   They spent 40 years wandering in the desert and now they're finally going to go.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.280]   And obviously Moses himself doesn't make it because of a sin that he commits, but he's
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.160]   trying to get them ready to get in.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.960]   So this is kind of like a pep talk before they get into the promised land.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.240]   So they're looking over the mountains and saying like if we just cross over this mountain
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.760]   on the other side is where God was leading them and they should have been there 40 years
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   earlier but because of their unbelief God caused them to wander out in the desert for
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.680]   40 years.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.800]   But before they enter he's trying to warn them and encourage them that entering into
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.680]   the promised land doesn't mean that you're finally home.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.760]   And so he begins chapter 90 by reminding them God is your refuge.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.920]   He is your dwelling place, not your promised land.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.960]   He's the one who's eternal.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.900]   He's the one who has control over your life.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.740]   Your destiny is not in your hands.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.120]   Just because you go there and then you're surrounded by mountains and you're fortified
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.360]   and finally you can have a stable nation doesn't mean that you have arrived.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.980]   So again it's kind of a pep talk.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.740]   Before we get there don't forget that your refuge, your strength has always been with
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.740]   you.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.180]   Before the mountains were ever created God was.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.940]   And so that was the first part that he was talking about in the first section verses
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.260]   1 through 6.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.620]   Who is God?
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.700]   To look up before we enter the promised land.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:28.260]   But in light of who he is, if he is our dwelling place, if he is our God, if he is our life,
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.500]   the most important question that any human being has to ask and repeatedly ask is where
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.140]   do you stand in your relationship with this God?
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.660]   It's not a question about whether you go to church, whether you grew up in a Christian
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.140]   home, how well you can recite the gospel, or how well did you serve the church.
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.620]   In your relationship with this God where do you stand?
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.520]   He started by reminding them about who God is.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.700]   And then the section that we're looking at this morning verses 7 through 12 he teaches
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.180]   us to see where they stand before this holy God.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.700]   Now on the surface I'm just going to tell you ahead of time, you know, it doesn't sound
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.300]   much like a pep talk.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.180]   If you have a group of people that you're going to lead into the promised land and you're
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.940]   trying to encourage them to be focused and to rely on God, verse 7 through 12 really
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.380]   at least in and of itself is going to sound like, "Wow, that's his pep talk?
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.280]   God is angry with you and we're going to die?
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.460]   Our life is short?
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.460]   Number our days?
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.460]   I mean that's his pep talk?"
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.460]   Right?
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.220]   I mean he's not a great motivational speaker if you see it in that context.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.660]   But you're going to see why this is so crucial to their life and success in the promised
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.860]   land because if you don't understand where you stand before God, you can be mistaken
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.180]   all your life thinking that somehow you have made it and then when you are in the presence
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.900]   of this holy God and God says, "I never knew you."
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.140]   So the most important question that any individual must ask is, "Where do I stand before this
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.220]   holy God?"
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.440]   So we looked at God.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.900]   Who is God to the nation of Israel, to God's people?
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.140]   And this week Moses is reminding them where the Israelites were because of their sins.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.760]   So first he says, "The reason why we die, the reason why the nation of Israel has passed
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.060]   away in verse 7, we have been consumed by your anger and by your wrath we have been
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.060]   dismayed."
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:45.900]   Now you have to understand Moses has led 600,000 fighting men into the desert, meaning including
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.780]   women and children there's probably well over 1.5 million people.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.620]   According to scripture, every single one of those people died out into the desert except
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.180]   two people.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.800]   The two spies, Joshua and Caleb, outside of those two, that means 1.5 million people perished
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.020]   because of their sins.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.260]   So Moses is looking at them, reminding them, "Don't forget the reason why you and I perished
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.780]   out here is because God was angry with us."
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.940]   In other words, he's telling them, "Don't repeat this when you get into the promised
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.180]   land."
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.180]   The reason why we're in the condition that we are is because we have been consumed by
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.300]   God's anger.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.340]   Obviously when he says consumed, he's talking about their death, their perishing.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:35.900]   And when he says the word anger, the word anger in Hebrew literally means nostrils.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.020]   When I think about the imagery that's given here is, you know when you see a cartoon and
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.860]   the bull is angry and he begins to flare his nostrils before he begins to rush, right?
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.780]   And that's the picture of God and his anger burning against Israel because of their sin.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.860]   He says we are dismayed.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.740]   In the King James Version it says we are terrified.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.780]   We are terrified because of his wrath.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.140]   He's reminding the nation of Israel that this is not, first and foremost, a friendly God.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.780]   In fact, all throughout the book of Leviticus, God was teaching the nation of Israel, "You
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.740]   cannot, you cannot just nonchalantly come into my presence.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.420]   All of everything that we studied in the book of Leviticus taught Israel, you are a sinner
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.500]   until you are atoned for, until you are covered by the blood of the animal, you cannot enter
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.540]   my presence."
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.540]   Remember when we were studying the book of Leviticus chapter 10, the first priests that
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   bring an offering to God, they are consumed by God's holy fire because they didn't follow
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.420]   instruction.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.540]   Imagine what the nation of Israel felt as they were practicing the book of Leviticus,
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.700]   as they were practicing the laws of Leviticus.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.980]   Because every single day they are reminded, without the shedding of blood there is no
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.980]   forgiveness.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.380]   The wrath of God remains on you.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.060]   Literally over and over again, even out in the desert, God becomes so angry.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.860]   He wanted to literally just open up the ground and just take them all out.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.100]   And there are times when Moses is the one who's pleading on his behalf, "Lord, what
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.220]   will the nation say that you brought us out here and if you consumed all of us?"
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.700]   And so God remains patient because of his interceding.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.700]   But he reminds the nation of Israel, first and foremost, that the God who is our refuge
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.580]   is a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.460]   Don't forget what happened out in the desert.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.980]   Part of the reason why Christianity has become what it has become in our generation is because
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.820]   the gospel has been preached falsely.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.980]   When disaster happens in our generation, the natural, the question that comes up from the
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:06.260]   secular world is, "If the God that you tell us is so good, why are these bad things happening?
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.460]   Why would a loving God allow 9/11 to happen?
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.180]   Why would a loving God allow famine to happen?
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.980]   Why would a loving God allow starvation to happen, sex trafficking to happen?
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:25.060]   Why would a God that you say loves the world so much allow that to happen?"
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.580]   Part of the reason why that's the first question that comes up whenever a disaster happens
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:36.020]   is because they do not understand where man stands before God.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:43.140]   The gospel does not begin by saying that God loves you and his compassion, has a wonderful
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.140]   plan for your life.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.420]   That's not how the gospel begins.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:52.140]   If you read the book of Romans, it says the wrath of God remains and it is being revealed
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.980]   against all unrighteousness.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:02.060]   So the gospel of God begins by telling us that a holy God is angry with the world.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.980]   That's the beginning point of the gospel.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:13.260]   Because until we recognize that a holy God is angry with the rebellious world, the natural
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.900]   question when disaster happens is, "Why would that gentle, loving, caring God allow this
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.180]   to happen?"
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.140]   So when you understand the gospel in the way that it is presented in the scripture, the
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.940]   natural question really should be is, "Why would a God who is that angry allow us to
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.280]   continue to live?
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.380]   Why did he not squash us already?
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.020]   If the God that you are telling us is so angry with the world because of our sins, why do
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.140]   we exist?"
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.380]   That's the question that the world should be asking if the gospel is presented correctly.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:56.020]   We have become so concerned with getting people through the door that we have compromised
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   the gospel.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.900]   And because of the compromise of the gospel, that the application of the gospel and the
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.540]   living of the gospel doesn't look anything like what we see in scripture.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.660]   Some of you guys may have seen this advertisement this week.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.060]   I believe it was either this week or last week it came out.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.860]   The military has a new marketing strategy to get millennials to come into the military.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.180]   Has anybody seen that this week?
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.300]   A few of you have seen that.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:35.940]   Basically the military has gotten now a poster saying, "We welcome snowflakes, selfie addicts,
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.660]   and me, me, me millennials to the military."
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.660]   No joke.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.660]   This is real.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.540]   This is why it was on the news.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.540]   Because they're having such a hard time getting millennials to volunteer for the military.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.180]   Well, we got to find a way to get them to recruit them into the military.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:59.340]   Now contrast that to the previous years of how they advertise military.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:05.060]   Some of you guys may remember, depending on what generation you grew up in, that Uncle
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.700]   Sam is looking for what?
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.340]   A few good men.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:17.260]   Or when I was younger, the thing was, "Be all that you can be."
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.260]   Make something of yourself.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.260]   Stop wasting your life.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   Join the military.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.900]   Do something.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.940]   Be all that you can be.
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.980]   Or the Marines, they have Semper Fi.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.580]   Always faithful.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.860]   How do we go from that to selfie addicts?
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.860]   Snowflakes welcome.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.020]   Me, me, me millennials.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.140]   We need you.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:49.700]   And the reason why this made the news was because the moment that they become a soldier,
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.220]   they're going to have to train that out of them.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.580]   No soldier who is a snowflake is going to be useful in the military.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:03.980]   No soldier who is self-absorbed and selfie addict is going to be useful in combat.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:09.580]   So they attract them to come in, but once they come in, I'm pretty sure the basic training
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.300]   is not going to change for them.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.620]   Once they get in, the basic training is going to be the same for everybody.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.740]   They're just trying to get them through the door.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.900]   We have preached the gospel in such a way to get them through the door once they get
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:29.220]   in, what they hear and what they see in the scripture is so unlike what was promised.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:36.460]   And we've allowed it in the church where it no longer looks like what we see in scripture.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.700]   If we don't recognize first and foremost where we stand, where sinners stand before a holy
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.060]   God, the gospel is not necessary.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:49.900]   God didn't come to a sinful world to help us live a better life.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.980]   He didn't come to a sinful world because he saw the world and they were hungry, so he
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.980]   decided to go and feed them.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:03.540]   He saved us from his own wrath, from his own anger because of our sins.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:08.120]   And he's reminded the nation of Israel, do not forget, the reason why we perish is because
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.020]   of our own sins.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.340]   Verse 8, you have placed our iniquities before you.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.180]   Now in the Bible, there's three separate degrees of sin.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.440]   The first degree of sin is the general sin that covers all sins.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.220]   It means to miss the mark.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.820]   In the Greek, the word that is used is hamartion.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.980]   And it is a general term meaning whatever God wanted for you, you didn't hit it.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.900]   And it doesn't sound as bad when you explain it that way.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.260]   But there's a second layer to that.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.820]   The second layer is the actual disobedience.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:44.120]   Willfully choosing what God told you not to do or not doing what God told you to do.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.940]   So it's the act itself.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.540]   That's the second layer.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:54.360]   The word that is used here in Hebrew, iniquity, is a much deeper word than that.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.140]   It's not just simply talking about missing the mark.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.320]   It's not talking simply about willfully doing an act.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.620]   It's talking about the corrupt nature of man.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.780]   You know we talk about we are sinners because we sin.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:12.900]   Iniquity, the word iniquity teaches us we sin because we're sinners.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.980]   In Psalm 51 verse 5 it says, "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.620]   conceived me."
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.980]   We didn't become sinners when we reached the age of accountability and all of a sudden
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.140]   we started to realize what we were doing.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.180]   The scripture says we were born into sin.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.700]   We were conceived in sin.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:38.280]   Not only were we conceived and born in sin, Jeremiah 13, 23 says, "Can the Ethiopian change
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.460]   his skin or the leopard his spots?
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.140]   Then you also can do good for accustomed to doing evil."
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.820]   Not only were you conceived in sin, born into sin, there's nothing you can do to change
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.660]   that.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.420]   Because it is not simply an act.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.100]   It's not something that you did and say, "Well, I'm not going to do that anymore."
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.060]   Because the term iniquity means there is a corruption, a rotting, a spiritual cancer
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.380]   that you and I cannot reach.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.540]   And the scripture says we are consumed because our rebellion goes much deeper than what you
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.800]   and I recognize.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.740]   If there's any particular thing that stands out to me in sanctification, you know, oftentimes
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.500]   we think of sanctification as, you know, here's some things that bad habits that I had and
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.000]   things that I weren't disciplined in and then as I was sanctified, I got better.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.180]   I got better at reading scripture.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.460]   I got better at purity and I got better doing this and that.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.260]   And all of these things are things that we need to work on as Christians.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:45.540]   But at the core of our sanctification is a deepening recognition of just how far we are
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.620]   from God without Christ.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:56.100]   And until we recognize that, Christ becomes a want and not a need.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.620]   There is a huge difference between a Christian who wants Christ versus a Christian who needs
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.420]   Christ.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.860]   A person who wants Christ can want him one day and not want him the next day.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.640]   Can want him in the beginning of the year and at the end of the year not want him because
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.380]   you don't have a need for him.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:21.900]   See, the beginning of the gospel teaches us our desperateness.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:28.660]   Where we stand before this holy God in our sins, we are consumed.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.780]   He says our secret sins are exposed in the light of his presence in verse 8.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.740]   His presence literally means in his face.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.260]   Intimately standing before this holy God, the first thing that gets exposed is our secret
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.260]   sins.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.660]   You know, there are sins that are pretty obvious.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.380]   The scripture says not to lay on hands hastily because some men's sins are obvious.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.340]   Some of us are not good at hiding our sins.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   It's obvious.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.500]   You walk into the door, there comes a sinner.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   It's obvious.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.020]   There are some men's sins trail behind them.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.580]   And that's why it says be careful, wait.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.980]   Because eventually it gets exposed.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.980]   But no matter how good we are in hiding our sins, it says in the presence of God, it gets
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.140]   exposed.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:22.420]   You notice that in every instance where a man of God stands before this holy God, their
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.220]   first reaction before they're even awed by God is terror.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.580]   Remember Isaiah in Isaiah chapter 6?
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.700]   He's being chosen to represent him to speak to the nation of Israel and he sees a vision
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.740]   of God and what happens?
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.740]   The first thing that happens, he falls to the ground in terror.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.020]   Woe is me, woe is me.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.500]   I am a man of unclean lips from the people of unclean lips.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.060]   He is terrified.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.500]   He doesn't stand there and say, "Oh my gosh, you're so holy.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.380]   These Israelites, how can they live like that if you're like this?"
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.260]   He's not worried about their sins.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.540]   He's not worried about what they're doing.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:10.780]   The first thing that happens is he recognizes his own sins and he falls to the ground in
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.300]   terror.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:19.740]   That's the first thing that happens when somebody is confronted by his holy presence.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.140]   They're not preoccupied with what other people are doing.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.980]   They're not disgusted by other people's sins because the sin that is nearest to them is
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.260]   in themselves.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:39.220]   Our secret sins that we did do such a great job hiding is exposed in the presence of this
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.220]   holy God.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.500]   In other words, there's nowhere to run.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.140]   You can fake it in front of other people, your closest friends, with church people,
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.500]   even with your wife and your husband at times.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.180]   But before a holy God, our sins are exposed.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.060]   In other words, we're completely vulnerable.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.580]   You cannot hide from God.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.540]   John, in the book of Revelation, same thing.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.780]   He sees a holy God, falls to the ground in terror.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:13.860]   Disciples, when God's glory is revealed through Jesus, they fall to the ground.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.420]   They're not saying, "Oh, these Pharisees, how can they not believe you?"
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.460]   That's not the first thing that comes out of their mouth.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.460]   They're terrified.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.460]   They get on their knees.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.460]   "We are not worthy.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.940]   Depart from us, Lord."
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.900]   Because their sins get exposed in the presence of his glory.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:36.100]   He says, "All our days have declined in your fury.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.500]   Because you are a holy God and you're angry with us, our life diminishes."
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.660]   And then he says, "We have finished our years like a sigh."
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.900]   They're not going into the promised land with a bang.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.820]   Majority of them have been washed out already and only Caleb and Joshua are walking into
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.020]   the promised land.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.540]   And even Moses himself, because he makes a mistake, he doesn't get in.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:05.300]   He says, "We're ending this journey with a sigh."
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.020]   All of us.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   Every single one of us.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.220]   Our experience in life.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:16.420]   And when it says our life ends with a sigh, sigh obviously is a metaphor.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.620]   They're talking about being deeply distraught, to regret, or to be weary.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.800]   That's when we sigh.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.700]   Nobody wins a lottery and says, "Oh."
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.860]   You don't go to a birthday party and say, "Oh."
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.940]   You kill joy.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.940]   Nobody does that.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.300]   Sigh is because there's deep regret.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   Deep regret.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.420]   He says, "That's the life of man in the presence of a holy God."
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:54.300]   And he's reminding the nation of Israel that you're not leaping into the promised land
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.500]   because you've been successful.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.620]   The only reason why God has allowed you to enter that is because God's been gracious
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.700]   to you and he made a covenant with you.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.920]   That's it.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.500]   The first and most important thing that any human being needs to recognize before this
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.460]   holy God is a desperate need for atonement.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.780]   Because this is who we are without Christ.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:23.540]   Secondly, because of this sin, because of this holy God, the life of man, he says, "As
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.340]   for the days of our life, they contain 70 years or of due strength, 80 years."
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.460]   He's not describing that all human beings die at 70 or 80.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.460]   Obviously that's not what he's saying.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.460]   Moses is well over 100 when he's writing this.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.660]   Basically what he's saying is that yet your boast is only labor and sorrow.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:46.580]   If let's say an average person lives 70 and then if you work hard to stay in shape, right?
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.140]   You drank kale juice every morning.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.180]   You stayed away from boba.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.500]   You ran in the morning.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   You lifted weights.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:01.540]   I mean you like worked your tail off and you added 10 more years to your life.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.620]   So if you live an average 70 years, if you work hard 80 years, he said, "Yet your boast
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.220]   is only labor and sorrow."
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.700]   In other words, all you've done extended your hardship.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.100]   Instead of 70 years of hardship, you have 80 years of hardship.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.660]   He said this is life of man.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.140]   And it is a reflection of what God said to Adam in Genesis chapter 3.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.340]   He says, "Cursed is the ground because of you," and talking about Adam, "because of
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   his sin.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.220]   In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life."
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.700]   I mean, you know, so many of you guys are young.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.140]   Not all of us, but so many of you, right?
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.300]   Ask anybody who's been working for 10 years.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.860]   Look at the way they wake up in the morning.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.820]   Nobody is leaping to work, nobody.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.300]   I don't care how much they love the work.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   I don't care how much they enjoyed it 10 years ago.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   Give them a few months.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.780]   A lot of times it doesn't even take more than that, a couple of years.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.420]   Maybe your dream job was to be a cop.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:16.340]   I know somebody, yeah.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:22.300]   Joe actually wanted to be a cop since he was like third grade or second grade.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.260]   Ask him if he feels like his dream came true.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.700]   Anyway, let me move on.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.700]   Okay.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.620]   He's sitting right there, so.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:39.300]   He says, "Every man's experience with this life, no matter how long you live, no matter
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:45.220]   how much you toil, no matter how much you try to lengthen it, in the end, our experience
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.140]   is common.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.980]   Both thorns and thistles, it shall grow for you and you will eat the plants of the field
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.460]   by the sweat of your face.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.180]   You will eat bread till you return to the ground because from it you were taken for
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.060]   you are dust and to dust you shall return."
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.740]   And then he says, "For soon it is gone and we fly away."
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:12.020]   And we think about it, Moses is watching everybody that he led basically die out in the desert
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.540]   and he's reminding them, "Don't forget.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.140]   Don't forget who he is.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.980]   Don't forget why we're in this situation."
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.620]   Who understands, verse 11, "The power of your anger and your fury according to fear that
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.620]   is due you."
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.620]   Obviously, it's a rhetorical question.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:38.180]   It's more of a command to recognize the fury of God's anger.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:46.420]   First and foremost, the fear of the Lord, the scripture says, is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:54.060]   Once we recognize who he is, then we recognize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:02.300]   Years ago, before my father passed, years before he passed, he had a bad heart attack.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.620]   And so we didn't know if he was going to live or not.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.260]   So we ended up taking him to a hospital way out in Corona.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.260]   He was there for 10 days and so obviously our family didn't know if he was going to
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.600]   make it or not.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.780]   So we were all on high alert and by the grace of God, he made it through that.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.060]   And then obviously the doctor said, "He's not completely strong so make sure that he's
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.060]   resting."
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:28.020]   And so on the way back home, I think he was living in Tustin at that time, on the way
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.260]   back home we stopped over at my house and I was living in Corona and we had a swimming
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.220]   pool in our backyard.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.340]   And so my dad, basically the doctor said, "Don't do anything strenuous because he's
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.340]   still very delicate."
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.540]   And we had him sitting outside just relaxing and then the kids were going swimming.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:51.060]   And so my dad was sitting outside and all the kids, we ended up going back inside.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:59.540]   And so all the adults are inside and all of a sudden we hear this splash in the water.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.660]   And so something happened and you could tell by the noise.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.740]   So we all ran outside and we saw my dad in the pool.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.500]   And so my oldest son, Jeremy, he was probably no more than four or five at the time.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.380]   We saw my dad basically fishing him out of the water and at that he didn't know how to
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.380]   swim yet.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:22.420]   So what happened was he had two older cousins, Nathan and Matthew, and they were a little
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.940]   bit younger but they knew how to swim.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.940]   So they put the slide, you know, the little slide next to the pool.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.820]   And so they were getting up and sliding into the water back and forth and so Jeremy thought,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.820]   "Hey, me too."
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.340]   And so after they went inside, Jeremy decided to go in and he slid into the pool but he
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.260]   didn't know how to swim.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.220]   So he was facing up, you know, upside down in the pool.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.500]   And obviously, I mean, those of you guys who've been around little kids around pools, it's
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.980]   dangerous because they don't make any noise when they drown.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.740]   So my dad was sitting there just relaxing and saw Jeremy just floating on the pool like
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.860]   that and obviously there's no other adults.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.700]   And again, my dad just had a heart attack.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.060]   He was sitting there to rest.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.180]   He went in there, jumped in the water and fished him out.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.900]   And the reaction that Jeremy gave was classic because he pulled him out and literally saved
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.260]   him.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.740]   Jeremy walked out and he shook it off and he turned around and said, "Thanks, Harabuji,"
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.740]   and then just walked in.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:20.340]   Harabuji is grandpa in Korea.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.380]   He had no idea what just happened.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:29.100]   My dad ended up spraining his ankle that he, you know, it took a long time for him to heal.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.540]   He was bruised, I think for years because he just wouldn't heal, you know.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.940]   He just came out of the hospital.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.780]   We didn't know if he was going to make it that week.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.780]   And he jumped in the butt.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.660]   Jeremy was just like, "Oh, thanks, Harabuji," and just walked right in.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.620]   And to this day, I don't think he understands what really happened.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.620]   I can explain it to him.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.240]   He's like, "Oh, okay," you know.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:30:01.420]   The reason why Paul takes 11 chapters describing God's mercy and His grace is so that when
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.340]   we get to chapter 12, he says, "In view of this mercy, present your body as a living
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.340]   sacrifice."
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:15.980]   See, when we don't understand what it is that you and I have been saved from, that's
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.620]   the kind of flippant response we give to this holy God.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.820]   "Oh, God, thank you.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.220]   Thank you," you know.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.660]   We thank Him for the jobs that we get when we're sick.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.820]   You know, He makes us healthy.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:32.460]   We thank you for circumstances or maybe good investments that we made.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.740]   And these are all such trivial things in light of what we already have in Christ that no
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.060]   one could take away from you, your eternal life.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.820]   The Son of God has been given to us to cover us of our iniquities that we could not hide
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:54.540]   before this holy God, that He gave His most precious Son to us every single day, even
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:00.740]   if we live the rest of our lives living in poverty and in sickness, we ought to be praising
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.540]   God for what He has already given us.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:12.420]   It's because we don't recognize what sin does in the presence of this holy God that we become
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.700]   flippant in our response.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:21.900]   See, on the surface, it's like, "Man, this guy, what kind of a pep talk is this?"
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:27.140]   He's not trying to squash their spirit.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.500]   Exactly the opposite.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.980]   The reason why He preaches sin and why the gospel starts out by saying, "All have sinned
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:40.500]   and fall short of the glory of God," until we recognize where we stand before God, without
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:49.140]   the covering of His blood, the rest of our life won't be given as a reasonable response.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:56.200]   That's why He concludes in verse 12 by saying, "So teach us to number our days that we may
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.500]   present to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.900]   In other words, He's saying, "Remind me how short my life is."
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:09.880]   2019, let me never forget how quickly 2018 went.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.300]   Let me never forget how quickly my 20s went, my 30s went, my 40s went, and how quickly
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   the 50s and 60s will go.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:25.380]   Let me always remember this, how short this life is, that I may live a life of wisdom,
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:31.840]   that I would depend upon a holy, eternal God who is my refuge, that I would not set my
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   hope here.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:39.260]   You know, in 2016, they did a study on the average lifespan of Americans.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.660]   It says it's 78.9 years.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:47.580]   Now, obviously, this is all averaging young children dying early, plus people who died
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.380]   past 100.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.060]   So if you live healthy lives, I'm sure you can live longer than that.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.220]   But it said on the average, it's 78.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:33:04.260]   So rounding it off to 80 years, that means, if you do the math, 29,200 days.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.620]   It says to help me number our days, so I'm actually numbering it for you.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:17.580]   29,200 days, and I'm like me specifically, 50, 51 years, 18,250 days, 10,000.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:23.460]   So I got about 10,000 days left, if I live average.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.260]   Some of you guys may have more, some of you guys may have less.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.380]   What are you going to do with those days?
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.700]   Do you spend it and just lose it?
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.460]   Or are they being invested for eternity on the things that matter?
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.800]   That all depends on what you believe.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.220]   If you believe this is your home, make the most of it.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.700]   But this is it, right?
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.460]   And if you don't experience it, if you don't taste it, if you don't go, you're going to
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.580]   lose out for eternity, if that's what you believe.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:02.540]   But if you believe that we're sojourners just passing by, it makes no sense for somebody
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:08.500]   who is traveling to Hawaii and investing all your money to buy a nice tent to go camping
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   on the beach.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.980]   Because it makes no sense, because you're going to have to go home.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.520]   Nobody in their right mind would do that.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.540]   No Christian in their right mind who believes what we profess to believe live as if we're
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.900]   going to be here for eternity.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.340]   Let me conclude with encouragement.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:35.900]   How many guys know the TV series Band of Brothers?
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   A lot of you.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.780]   Okay, so some of this is going to make sense.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.300]   And I thought this was so profound.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.940]   So I think it was like...
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.940]   It's basically a...
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.940]   What do you call that?
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.940]   A docuseries?
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.900]   Well, it's not a documentary, but it's...
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.500]   Well, Andy, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.340]   Basically it's a movie based upon someone's journal about what actually happened.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.620]   And it's about this Yeezy company.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:11.140]   And in, I think it was about third or fourth episode, they jump into Normandy on D-Day.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.860]   And this one private, he's shell-shocked.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.420]   So whenever the war breaks out, he freaks out.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.500]   And he's ashamed of himself.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.860]   And you can see it in his eyes.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:28.220]   And so he's in the foxhole and the enemy starts to drop bombs and shooting.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.540]   And all his fellow soldiers are out of the foxhole and they're shooting.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.580]   And he's about to jump out and then he falls back in fear.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:40.140]   And he's hiding out in the foxhole in terror.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.340]   Well, after all the shooting is done, and all of his friends are out, and he's ashamed
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.500]   of himself, and you could tell.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.540]   And so the sergeant comes and he wants to confess.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.300]   So he confesses to his sergeant.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.220]   And he says, "Sergeant, you know, when that thing starts shelling, you know, I jumped
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.220]   in.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.340]   I was, I crouched in my foxhole and I didn't go out at all."
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.340]   And he, again, he's ashamed of himself and he's confessing this to his sergeant.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   And sergeant says, "You know what your problem is?"
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   And he says, "Yeah, I'm afraid."
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:17.700]   And he says to the private, "Private, we're all afraid.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.260]   There's none of us here who's not afraid."
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.620]   And so he's kind of confused.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.860]   He said, "You know what your problem is?"
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:31.060]   And so he's just kind of looking up and he says, "It's because you think you have hope."
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:38.580]   He says, "You need to realize that we're already dead.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:43.340]   Until you realize you're already dead, you're not going to be a good soldier.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.660]   Your life depends on it and this war depends on it.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.660]   You have to fight as a man who's already dead."
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.900]   I thought it was so profound.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.900]   It's not in the Bible.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:01.060]   There's something like it in the Bible.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.420]   It's because you have hope that somehow if you hide in that foxhole that you're going
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.140]   to survive.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.460]   In order for you to be a good soldier, you have to accept the fact.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.680]   You have to accept the fact that you're a dead man and fight.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:26.140]   So many of us hide out in our foxholes because we haven't given up hope in this world.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:32.100]   That somehow if I work harder, if I make the right investments, if I align myself with
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:38.820]   the right company and the right people, that I'm going to make it in this world.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:48.400]   And that false hope in this fallen world is keeping us in our foxholes, being unproductive.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:53.840]   Until we recognize that we are crucified with Christ, it is no longer us who lives.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.600]   And Christ who lives in us, we become useless as soldiers in God's kingdom.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.760]   He who finds his life, he will lose it.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.960]   He who loses his life for Christ, he will find it.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:14.000]   So I pray that in 2019, that we would have that eternal perspective, that recognize that
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.400]   this is no longer our life to live.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.440]   It is for Christ.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:28.800]   Let's pray.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.760]   As our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.
