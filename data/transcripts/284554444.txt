[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   We joined a church in the last couple of years and we haven't reviewed, again, the meaning
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.480]   of communion in our church.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.160]   And so we want to make sure that we participate not as a religious ritual, but something that
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.240]   we really know what we're getting into.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.720]   So I'm going to take some time today to cover that before we participate in communion.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720]   So let's pray.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.880]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace, especially
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.720]   as we prepare our hearts for this communion Sunday.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.360]   We ask, Lord, that you would search our hearts, know and show us, Lord God, if there's any
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.200]   hurtful ways in us.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.280]   If our minds, our habits, what we run to for refuge and for Sabbath, if it is anything
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.200]   but you, I pray, Father God, that this time of communion, the sacred time, Lord God, that
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.640]   you've ordained would cause our church to be mindful of who you are and what you've
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.640]   done.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.080]   And that we would not just in our thinking, but in our hearts, in our wills, in the very
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.920]   way that we spend our lives, Lord God, we'd be recalibrated according to your will.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.240]   So we pray for your blessing this time.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.520]   Amen.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.640]   There was a stretch of period while in the beginning of the church in order to make extra
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.200]   income I had to teach ESL.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.080]   And for about five years I taught various levels of ESL.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.040]   And one of the things that I learned from teaching ESL, being trained how to teach ESL,
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.520]   is that English is a very difficult language to pick up.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.760]   And part of the reason why is because there's so many irregulars.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.080]   You know, when you teach grammar, you teach the rule, and then there's a lot of things
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   that just don't fit.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.840]   In fact, more than 45% of the grammar doesn't fit the rules that you teach.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.880]   So one of the things that I was taught in teaching ESL is to not teach grammar.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   Right?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.840]   He said, not to teach, not at all, but he said, don't make teaching English about teaching
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.280]   grammar because they're going to get confused.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.600]   And so he said, just mimic.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.880]   You know, like this is the way they speak.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.040]   And so we do a lot of role playing.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.120]   And then you would say, this is what they would do when they go to the market.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.200]   And this is what they would do when they go to the post office.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.720]   And then we would just kind of mimic each other, and that's how people would pick up
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   English.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.080]   There's a lot of things that we say in English that even we don't know where it comes from.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   But we just say it anyway.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.520]   There's a lot of idioms.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.020]   See if you can, see if maybe some of you guys can recognize some of this.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.600]   You can't have your cake and eat it too.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   What does that mean?
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Right?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.440]   We know what it means, but what does that mean?
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   Right?
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   You can't have your cake and eat it too.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.880]   But we say it all the time.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.840]   It's raining cats and dogs.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   Why cats and dogs?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   Right?
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.400]   These are the things that we say all the time.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.880]   We just say it because you probably heard it somewhere and you just mimic, and that's
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.740]   how you learned it.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.320]   If you want to hear from somebody directly, what do you say?
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.600]   You want to hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Where did that come from?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.080]   Does that make any sense to you?
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.360]   But we use it all the time because that's what we heard, and so that's what it means.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.600]   We just say it, but we don't know where it comes from.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.640]   Maybe some of you guys do.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.440]   If somebody is staying quiet and they're not speaking, what do you say?
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.720]   Cats got your tongue.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   Right?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.080]   What does that have to do with staying quiet and not sharing?
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   What's wrong?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.080]   Cats got your tongue?
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.440]   Again, there's so many of these.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.920]   I could just sit here for the next hour just talking about idioms that we don't really
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.800]   understand we use, but it's part of our language.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.160]   When you get sick or you don't feel well, what do you say?
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.920]   You are under the weather.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.040]   What does that mean?
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Where did that come from?
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.880]   So if you're teaching English to a non-English speaking person and they tell you, "Okay,
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.720]   when you're sick, you say you're under the weather."
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   Why?
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.760]   Why would you say that?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.280]   I don't know.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.900]   I just heard it from my teachers and I heard it growing up, so I just repeat it.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.080]   When you go evangelism just randomly out on the street, what do you say?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   You go cold turkey.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   What does cold turkey have to do with evangelism?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.760]   Or if you're doing sales and you're just calling people up randomly without any kind of previous
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.400]   call, you say you're calling cold turkey.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.140]   Where does that term come from?
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.800]   If you Google it, I'm sure you can find it.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.160]   You can Google it.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.080]   Some of these idioms I looked at and it had actually pretty decent reasons and where it
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   came from.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.120]   A lot of these things, nobody knows.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.680]   It's just been passed down from generation to generation and so it just became a part
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   of the English language and we know how to use it in context, but we don't exactly know
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.840]   where it came from.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.480]   Anything that we do repeatedly year after year after year after year, there are certain
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.040]   things that just kind of fall through without us ever really asking.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.680]   So when you're learning English for the first time, they will always ask, "What does that
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.680]   mean?
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   Where did it come from?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.800]   Why do you use that phrase?"
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   But if you've been speaking English all your life, there's tons of things that we say that
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   we don't think twice about.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.120]   It's just part of our language.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.680]   Now there are certain things that we can get away with and it'll function fine, but a lot
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.880]   of times what we do as Christians in the church also creep through without ever really knowing
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.200]   why.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.440]   We just do it.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   Why does a church need to gather together in corporate worship?
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.960]   Why can't you sit in front of a television and watch the program?
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.360]   Why is it necessary to come together?
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.320]   Why do we sing certain songs?
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.920]   Why do some churches have praise teams and why do some churches only use organs?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.120]   Imagine all these things that happen that if you happen to have grown up in a church,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.360]   whatever culture that was normal in that church, you just kind of became part of what you believe
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.580]   Christianity is without really thinking through why these things are happening.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.960]   And of all the things that we do, that we actually need to know what it is, one of the
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.680]   most key things that we do as a church is the communion table.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.960]   So why do we do it?
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.240]   What is the meaning behind it?
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.160]   Does it have some special power over you that if you do it or don't do it, it's going to
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.360]   have some kind of effect?
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.280]   We need to understand what we're participating in, that you don't just do it because you're
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.200]   a member of the church and you just happen to come to Berean and then we have communion
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.360]   every other month and so we just do it.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.080]   We're told it's important, so it's important.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.000]   So I'm going to give you briefly the different views.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   The first two views are not, we wouldn't consider that a debatable issue within the Christian
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   community.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.960]   The first is the Roman Catholic, the second is the traditional Lutheran view.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.280]   The first view, the Roman Catholic view, is called a transubstantiation.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.640]   In transubstantiation, the wine and bread become the literal body and blood of Jesus
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   Christ.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.200]   So when Jesus says, "Do this and this is my blood and this is my body," they take that
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.040]   literally means that when the communion is given in service, that it literally becomes
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.480]   the blood, literally becomes the flesh of Christ.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.800]   Obviously that's not what it means, right?
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.480]   There's a lot of things that Jesus said.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.780]   When Jesus says, "I am the vine," he didn't literally mean that he was the vine.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.080]   He was using it symbolically to mean something.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.160]   So obviously we do not believe that.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.760]   The Lutherans believe in what's called the consubstantiation.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.920]   So when Luther protested against the church, he evaluated what they were doing.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.440]   He said, "No, it is not literal."
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.000]   But he took maybe about half a step away from the Catholic Church, called consubstantiation,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.400]   where wine and bread, not literally the body blood, but Jesus Christ is literally present
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.560]   in the body and the blood.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   Meaning that the bread and the wine doesn't necessarily literally become the body and
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   blood of Christ, but Christ stands here.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.040]   So the Lutherans believe whenever we have communion, Jesus physically, spiritually,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   that we can't see, is present.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.780]   Again, that is not what we believe.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.240]   The next two views are the two views between the Presbyterians and the Baptists.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.400]   These majority of Protestants will fall into one or the other view.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.920]   We're Baptist, so let me give you the first, the Presbyterian view.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.600]   And their view is the sacramental view, memorial.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.540]   It's something done in remembrance of Jesus' death and in anticipation of his second coming,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.280]   but here's where we differ.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.720]   Jesus is present spiritually in the wine and bread.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.120]   It is a participation in the body of Christ.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.440]   So there is some benefit of participating in it because there is a dynamic presence
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.480]   of Christ in the communion table.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.400]   Meaning that when you participate in it, there is some spiritual benefit to the church.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.960]   Literally there is some spiritual benefit because the dynamic presence of Christ is
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.120]   in the communion table.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.360]   So they tend to, some churches tend to do it more often, week after week after week.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.440]   Or some churches will do it even more than that.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.960]   Every time they get together, it's kind of like the Catholic church.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.440]   Every time they gather, whether it's Bible study or not, they will have some type of
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.400]   communion.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.060]   Because of this dynamic presence in that.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.400]   And this is also related to the infant baptism.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.720]   Whether they confess Christ as Lord and Savior, there is some dynamic presence of Christ in
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.320]   the baptism where there is a blessing over that child because of the baptism.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   And that's where we differ as Baptists.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.880]   The Baptists believe, we call this a memorial, primary to remember.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.400]   It's primarily symbolic.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.280]   So the first is the same.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.400]   Something done in remembrance of Jesus' death and in anticipation of his second coming.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:16.040]   And the reason why we don't believe that there is a blessing, but the blessing is primarily
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   symbolic.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.360]   And the reason why I believe that, the reason why the Baptists believe that, because in
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   the Old Testament, when the sacrifices were given, when they didn't do this in a manner
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.800]   worthy of Christ, what did God say to the Israelites?
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.920]   Your burnt offering is meaningless.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.960]   And the scripture says that all the sacrifices had absolutely no power to forgive sins.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.480]   All it did was to symbolically point to Christ.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.640]   And so when Christ came and fulfilled it, there is no power in and of the act of itself.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.960]   The only reason why there was power in it is because they participated in faith and
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.560]   what it pointed to.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.320]   So when we come to the New Testament, we practice communion.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.520]   Communion, the purpose of it was ultimately symbolically cause us to remember.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.240]   And the benefit that we have in the communion table is that as we remember, and as we talked
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.960]   about last week, when Paul says that he did this in order to stir up in them in remembrance
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.400]   of what Christ has done.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.800]   So the primary purpose of the communion table is to cause us to keep the death and resurrection
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.400]   of Jesus Christ at the forefront of our thoughts, at the forefront of our singing, our Bible
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.240]   study and our fellowship.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.680]   Because the moment we stray away from that, everything else becomes just ritual.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.800]   Just like it did in the Old Testament when they were giving all these sacrifices, and
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.000]   yet when it came to true devotion to God and mercy and grace toward those who are in need,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.880]   God said your sacrifices meant absolutely nothing.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:04.740]   So the Baptist view is strictly for the purpose of remembering, to stir up in us remembering.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.480]   In Luke chapter 11, verse 14 to 22, it says, "When the hour came, he reclined at table
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.960]   and the apostles with him.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   And he said to them, 'I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.840]   for I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.'"
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.400]   He's talking about his death and resurrection.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   He took up a cup and when he had given thanks, he said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.280]   for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   of God comes."
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.440]   And he took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.640]   is my body which is given for you.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.440]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.320]   And likewise, the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.880]   is the new covenant in my blood."
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.920]   So the benefit, again, of the communion table is to fulfill what Christ says.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.200]   That every time you do this, this Passover meal, which was replaced by the communion,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.040]   this is this communion meal that they had in the early church, breaking of bread, it
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.240]   is no longer to talk about the deliverance of Israel from the Egyptians, but deliverance
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.820]   of our sins by Christ, by remembrance.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.880]   So participating in the communion table in and of itself has no benefit for you.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.320]   In and of itself.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:33.040]   If you came in here with hearts that are hardened, having communion doesn't cause you to be a
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.800]   better Christian.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.320]   You are not better off in standing before God because you participate in the communion
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.180]   table.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.840]   You were somehow spiritually weak and then you participate in the communion table.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.240]   By in and of itself, there is no benefit.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.840]   In fact, it can actually ruin you by not participating in a worthy manner.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.120]   So we'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.400]   In a nutshell, I've explained to you at least the Baptistic view of communion.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.820]   At our church, we have it every other month.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.920]   We could have it every month.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.120]   We could have it every week.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.640]   There's nothing in the scripture that mandates how often it should be done.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.200]   I've had plenty of debates with friends and saying that it should be done more regularly,
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.920]   maybe once a month, or even every week.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.400]   But again, all of that is completely arbitrary because it is not mandated in scripture.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.220]   Having it every month doesn't make it more precious.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.960]   Having it every week doesn't make it any less precious.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.600]   But the meaning behind it doesn't change.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   If the primary purpose of this is to cause us to remember and is a replacement of the
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.960]   Passover meal, what was the purpose of the Passover meal?
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.600]   And what were we to remember?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.960]   There are three aspects of things that we need to focus on, and hopefully we'll get
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.360]   a better understanding of what Christ desires from us.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.080]   Number one, the Passover meal was a celebration of God's deliverance of Israel.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.200]   So Israelites did that for hundreds of years, and every time they had the Passover meal,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.720]   it was causing them to think about the beginning of Israel, the deliverance.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:21.040]   So in Exodus chapter 13, it says, "Then Moses said to the people, 'Remember this day in
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.360]   which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by a strong hand the
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.440]   Lord brought you out from this place.'"
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.900]   Their primary role was to declare God's glory and worship Him.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.640]   That was the purpose of Israel.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:44.360]   The moment that they forgot what God had done, their ability to worship God is tainted.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:50.040]   Because if the whole purpose of our gathering is to worship God, and then the whole motivation
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:56.360]   and the fuel behind why we worship God is represented at this communion table, the moment
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:03.880]   Christ's sacrifice and death and resurrection of Christ has become old to you, so has your
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.400]   worship.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.440]   It doesn't matter how loud you sing.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.040]   It doesn't matter how much money you put into the basket.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.680]   It doesn't matter how early you woke up to serve the church.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   Because the primary fuel, primary motive in why we worship God is because of what Christ
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.000]   has done.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.520]   And so the nation of Israel was commanded that every year, and the Passover was their
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:35.880]   greatest holiday, that every Passover that they would reenact what happened in the beginning
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.960]   of the nation of Israel.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   And that's what we are to remember primarily at the communion table.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.480]   1 Corinthians 11, 26, "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   the Lord's death until he comes."
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.560]   So when we participate in the communion table, it is to remind us of what he has done.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.080]   I can tell you, when I sit in front of somebody, and we can talk about church, we can talk
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.680]   about evangelism, we can talk about feeding the poor and taking care of orphans, and we
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.200]   can talk about all of that, and there's a lot of excitement and passion.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.920]   But if there is no passion for what Christ has done, all of that is nothing more than
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.420]   social work.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:25.440]   Because the primary thing that God wants us to do is to give him worship.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:32.040]   So if Christ's death and resurrection has just become idioms that have just kind of
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.680]   passed through from generation to generation, it just kind of happened to stop with you.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.640]   And if somebody asks you, like, "What do you believe?"
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.280]   You say, "Well, I believe Jesus died."
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.120]   You don't know how many times I've been out on the street sharing the gospel with somebody,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.760]   and they chased me out saying, "I know that already.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.120]   Get out of here."
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.320]   Or even within the church, we'd have a conversation about Christ, and there's this kind of blank
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.240]   look on their face as if it has nothing to do with them.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.200]   It's like, "Well, I already know it.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.440]   It's almost kind of like I've done my part already.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.800]   I'm already justified, so stop telling me this."
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:15.960]   The moment that the news of the gospel becomes old, everything that you're doing as a Christian
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   is tainted.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.920]   It's no different than the Israelites who are coming and giving meaningless sacrifices
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.160]   where they're singing songs and they're serving the temple, and God says, "Your assembly is
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   evil.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.680]   Your singing is noise to me."
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.520]   That's why he implemented this year after year after year to remind them, to fuel them
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.080]   for worship.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:49.880]   Let me ask you, and the same question I asked last week, remember when the cross of Christ
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.700]   was the reason why you came to church?
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.560]   Not because of some event, not because you're meeting your friends, where you wanted to
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:05.280]   meet Christ, because what Christ has done affected you so deeply.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.200]   Some of you are brand new Christians, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.400]   The moment that that gospel message that you may have heard all your life and you understood
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.840]   bits and pieces, but all of a sudden by his Holy Spirit took his words and it was yours.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.640]   He didn't just forgive sins, he forgave your sins.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   As a result of that, you wanted to sing like you've never sung before.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:35.040]   All of a sudden, sitting and having conversation about Christ was enjoyable.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.960]   You wanted to study to know what the Word of God says, because the God who wrote it
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.020]   gave his most precious gift to you.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.940]   Even evangelism.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:53.920]   When evangelism becomes a duty where you have to share or else God's going to be angry,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.800]   we're just not effective no matter how much effort we put into it.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.880]   No matter how hard we study and put all the newest techniques, it's just not effective
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:10.420]   because people look right through it and say, "Well, you don't believe it."
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:15.540]   We are the best in worship, our fellowship, our evangelism.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:21.640]   Everything that we do is directly affected by how you are affected by the cross.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.960]   We all talk about how we want to be like the early church.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.080]   The early church described in Acts 2, 44 to 47, "And all who believed were together and
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.840]   all had things in common."
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.560]   They were all just openly sharing with one another.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.960]   And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.920]   all as any had need.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.440]   And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.920]   their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920]   people.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.640]   And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:01.220]   I mean, you're talking about an ideal church who was generous, they loved to get together,
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:07.400]   they were devoted to the study and prayer, and then evangelism was happening.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:14.300]   As a result of their devotion, the Lord was adding to their number constantly.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.240]   So we look back at them and say, "Well, how do we become like the early church?
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.380]   What did they do?
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.100]   What program caused them to be this way?
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:29.780]   What kind of discipleship led to this church?
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:36.780]   What kind of teaching, what was it that caused all of them to be generous?
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.380]   To get together and just couldn't wait to fellowship?
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.020]   Where people were just coming to participate?
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:52.680]   How were they running the church that they had that kind of a church that we all envy?
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.780]   Only thing that we knew is they heard the preaching of the cross and they were convicted
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.300]   and they repented.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.820]   That's it.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.580]   That's what happened.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.540]   The preaching of the cross caused them to be convicted and they repented and then all
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.660]   of a sudden you have a church that was generous.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.020]   It wasn't because they had years of training of stewardship.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:19.060]   It wasn't because they were taught this great doctrine they dug and the more they understood
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.060]   the greater the church became.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:28.840]   No, they were people who had just simply heard the preaching of the cross and they were convicted.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.500]   At the core of discipleship is what we're participating in today.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:41.460]   Is to remember and to rethink and reconsider where is your heart in line with what we are
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.060]   participating today.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.480]   When we talk about the cross has your heart become numb?
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.460]   Has it become old information when we talk about his death and resurrection?
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.480]   When we talk about the judgment of the world and the glory that is coming with Christ has
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.240]   that just become theology in your heart?
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.900]   You don't need more discipleship for that.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.780]   Something has caused you to be hardened in your heart and the only remedy that the scripture
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.940]   gives for that is Christ crucified.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.880]   Now don't get me wrong.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.940]   The scripture does tell us to teach them to observe all that I have commanded in the great
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:23.540]   commission that it is our duty in the church to teach and to disciple.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:32.540]   But the primary thing that causes us to be better worshippers is what this table represents.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.560]   In Psalm 51 9-17, "Hide your face from me."
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.700]   This is David confessing his sins.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.260]   And blot out all my iniquities.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.900]   Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.140]   Cast me not away from your presence and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.340]   Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.100]   Uphold me with a willing spirit.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.660]   In his repentance, what does it say?
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.980]   What has his sin caused in his heart?
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.740]   The joy of his salvation.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:07.460]   The joy of his salvation was quenched because of his sins.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.660]   That's what the communion table does.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:14.780]   It causes us to examine ourselves, to see, because we need to confess our sins.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.960]   We need to acknowledge and receive forgiveness.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:26.380]   There is no power in and of itself if you do not come in repentance, without self-examination,
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:31.100]   because the communion table is the open door where we can approach the throne of grace
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.900]   with confidence.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:38.980]   But if we're nonchalant about our sins, we're probably nonchalant about our salvation.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.060]   And so when David pleads, the primary thing that he pleads for is to restore the joy of
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:49.820]   my salvation, because without the joy of my salvation, it doesn't matter how loud you
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.340]   sing.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.020]   It doesn't matter how hard you study the Bible.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.740]   It doesn't matter how much sweat equity you put into building up the church, because what
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:09.740]   God desires more than anything else is worshippers who will worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:15.020]   But if the joy of your salvation has been quenched, possibly because of compromise,
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:21.180]   maybe neglect, whatever it may be, the communion table was given to us so that we can remember
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.360]   and recalibrate and refocus.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.260]   The second thing, the reason why God gave the Passover meal, number two, the Passover
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.660]   served to remind Israel of God's care and deliverance during times of hardship.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:41.940]   In Deuteronomy 7, 17 and on, it says, "If you say in your heart, 'These nations are
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.220]   greater than I, how can I dispossess them?'
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.460]   You shall not be afraid of them, but you shall remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.060]   and to all Egypt."
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:58.260]   God already knew as he delivered them that times of hardship is going to come.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.540]   And because we live in this physical world, when you see your enemies coming, when you
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:09.100]   see hardship coming, and you forget who you serve, that every time that you have the Passover
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:15.300]   meal, we are to remember God's power and deliverance and care for us so we would not fall into
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   despair.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.980]   Verse 19, "The great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.180]   and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out, so will the Lord
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.580]   your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid."
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.420]   So the second meaning of the communion table are for believers who confess that Christ
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.380]   gave his only begotten Son to die for them.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.180]   And again, I want you to really consider what that means.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.340]   Those of you who are worried about not being able to pay your bills tomorrow, those of
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.660]   you who are worried about the future of your children, those of you who are worried about
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:56.060]   your jobs, maybe even your health, whatever it is that causes anxiousness while living
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.580]   on this earth, this fear that somehow we're not keeping up with the Joneses or the Kims
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.180]   or the Chains.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:12.420]   All that anxiety that is created because we forget who we serve, that we're comparing
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.760]   ourselves with the rest of the world and we want to be where they are, where God calls
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.060]   us to be light and where they are to look at us and to be envy where we are at.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.940]   And so if we're living our life looking at them with envy, something has seriously gone
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.820]   wrong.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.260]   Romans chapter 8, 31 to 36 says, "What shall we say then to these things?
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.300]   If God is for us, who can be against us?"
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.840]   What is causing anxiousness?
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.340]   Can you possibly be sick and God looks at it and says, "Oh my gosh, I forgot him for
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.340]   a minute."
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:53.060]   A God who sent his only begotten Son to die for us and he said he counts the very hairs
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.620]   on our head, could he have possibly forgotten about you?
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:04.140]   Could he have possibly looked at the world and said, "Oh shoot, I forgot."
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.020]   You take our children and no matter how much we love them, if the three-year-old runs off
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.460]   and we're constantly living in anxiety that we're going to lose them when we're in public.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:17.820]   You think that's what happened to God whenever we feel lost and we are anxious?
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:23.500]   He just has too many kids to look after and he just lost some.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.300]   Verse 32, "He who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us, how will he not also
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.160]   with him graciously give us all things?
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.980]   How will he not if he gave his only begotten Son?"
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.900]   If somebody gave you a brand new car, you think he's going to be stingy with gas?
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:52.380]   "I gave you this car, I spent $25,000 to give you this car and I just worked so hard to
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.460]   give you this car but I can't use it because I don't have gas money."
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.940]   He's like, "You get your own gas money."
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:07.260]   He who did not spare his own son, how will he not along with him give us all things?
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.580]   That's what the communion table was to do, is to cause us to remember.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   Now, it is only effective if you believe.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.700]   If you don't believe it, it's just theory.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.260]   These are just thoughts, this is part of theology, this is what the church teaches.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.980]   But if you believe this, how can you not be affected?
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.300]   The moment anxiousness comes, our first thought is, "I have a sovereign God who loves me and
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.980]   gave his only begotten Son."
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.120]   Do you believe that?
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.140]   And that's what this communion table was meant to do, cause you to take a step back and ask
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.300]   yourself, "Do you believe in what this represents?
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.240]   Do you believe that this is the body of Christ that was broken for you?
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:30:00.480]   Do you believe that he shed his only begotten Son's blood to save you from hell?
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   Do you believe that?"
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   And if you believe that, do you think that anything that's happening in your life, any
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.240]   anxiousness that you feel, is because somehow God has forgotten about you?
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.120]   Or he ran out of mercy?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.920]   That somehow his hands is too short to reach you?
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:24.080]   It is to remind us of who he is and what he has given.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.720]   Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.040]   It is God who justifies.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.200]   Who is he that condemns?
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.520]   Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.920]   More than that, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   on our behalf.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.360]   Not only did he send his only begotten Son, he is continually working, praying on our
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   behalf.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.160]   Again, this is only effective if you believe.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.640]   If you don't believe it, or you just kind of received it out of kind of like inheritance,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.960]   you think you received your faith as an inheritance from your parents, you grew up in the church,
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.320]   so there's more superstition in you than real faith.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.720]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.520]   You're more afraid of not doing the right thing superstitiously.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.080]   So somehow God's not going to bless you, your kids aren't going to be healthy, or you started
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.160]   a business and you're not going to do well.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.120]   It's more superstition.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:23.640]   And so if you're living your life out of superstition, you will do what is required, absolute minimum
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.820]   requirement to meet that need.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:35.300]   But if you believe this, this becomes your pursuit.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.980]   This becomes your treasure.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.160]   This becomes your comfort.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.100]   This becomes your refuge.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.660]   This becomes your hope.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.660]   If you believe it.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:52.060]   Again, you know, the reason why I keep saying this is because we live in a place of the
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:59.380]   world where Christianity is assumed, and so we grow up in churches where we just assume
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.380]   we're believers because we've been doing this physically, never really giving serious thought,
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.100]   do I believe this?
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:13.540]   And if I do believe this, what does this mean?
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.740]   You can't confess to believe this and then think and act and feel like the rest of the
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:24.060]   world because your actions contradict your faith.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.220]   It needs to be consistent, and so that's what this is.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.660]   It is a recalibration of believers who may have drifted.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:40.260]   Thirdly, the Passover served to remind Israel of God's provision during times of abundance.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:45.780]   There are people in our church who are struggling, who have loved ones who are sick or having
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:54.060]   financial issues or serious issues, marriage problems, but there are greater numbers of
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:01.380]   us who are living in absolute peace and in abundance, and we are wrestling to remind
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.820]   ourselves that we need Christ.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.500]   And every Sunday you come, you are reminded that you need Christ, but the moment the Sunday
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:15.980]   service is over, everything about your life says you don't really need him.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.260]   That's why this communion table is here.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:23.020]   Deuteronomy chapter 8, 11, it says, "Take care lest you forget the Lord your God."
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:28.940]   And again, this is the constant struggle of where we live because your bills are paid
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.460]   for.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.640]   Nobody's trying to bomb your house.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.780]   Your children are well-educated, well-fed, well-entertained.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.880]   And so we have a tendency to forget, constantly forget.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:48.860]   And we are comforted by the fact that we go to church, which is very, very, very, very
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:54.540]   dangerous to rely on church attendance for our safety because the people who are rebuked
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:34:00.140]   the harshest were the Pharisees, who are the busiest at the temple.
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.960]   Take care lest you forget the Lord your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.340]   and his statutes which I commanded you, lest when you have eaten and are full and have
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:13.920]   built good houses and live in them, when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.120]   and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied, then your heartbeat lift it
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.700]   up and you forget the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.620]   of slavery.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.100]   Let me say something that's going to be really disturbing to you, and hopefully it's not,
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.340]   but it may.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:40.460]   If you're a Christian who are living in abundance and peace and your heart has become dull and
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:49.020]   drifted away from God, disaster is the greatest thing that can happen to you.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.300]   Sickness is the greatest thing that will happen to you.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.980]   Hardship is the greatest thing that will happen to you because God will use that to recalibrate
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.660]   you and bring you back.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:06.620]   If you're not a Christian and you're living in peace and you're drifting, that's the worst
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.540]   thing that can happen because God has released you and allowed you to drift.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:16.340]   You're drifting far and far and far away from God and you're living in peace and you feel
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.580]   no anxiousness, there's no sense of urgency to get right with God.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:26.460]   You're just watching your boat floating away and nothing is happening in your life.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.340]   That's the worst thing that can happen to you.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:36.740]   If you're a believer that has drifted and your heart has hardened and you are a genuine
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:45.260]   believer and God truly does love you, he will discipline you.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.780]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:53.580]   Not because he hates you, not necessarily simply as a punishment, but to bring you back
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.060]   because he loves us.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:00.380]   So the communion table is to remind us not to become arrogant, to remember that we are
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:06.420]   in dire need of Christ, to recalibrate a sense of urgency for him.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.060]   That even while our bills are paid, even when our children are well and our marriage is
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:16.740]   going well and ministry on the surface looks like it's going well, that when we look to
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:24.500]   the cross and why he came and what the scripture says about the end, collegians, everybody
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.940]   else, we just came out of studying the book of Revelation.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.540]   Maybe we've already forgotten where this is headed.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.660]   And so the purpose of this is to restore in us a sense of urgency for your sins and for
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.360]   the sins of the people that you love.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.760]   Maybe you have a mom or a dad or brother or a sister or co-worker or even a stranger or
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.340]   neighbor who do not believe and your heart has become hardened toward them and them going
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.580]   to hell is something that you confess, but there's no urgency to share the gospel.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:01.260]   This is to remind us of what you and I confess every single Sunday and that your life and
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.820]   your speech and your heart, the way you spend your money, the way you spend your time, what
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:11.220]   you are looking for, who you are comparing with, what you envy, when it does not match
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:18.540]   what we celebrate at this table, the communion table is to recalibrate us, to bring us back,
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:26.540]   to remind us that we are desperate without Christ, that we are desperate and that the
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.100]   world is under judgment.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:36.060]   See, a Christian cannot confess that and say, "Oh well," and walk away.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.860]   Then you wouldn't be a Christian.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.660]   By your action, you confess you do not believe.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.500]   So again, if you are a believer, it is to recalibrate that.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:55.260]   If you are not a believer, it may cause you to confirm that you do not believe.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.500]   Hosea chapter 13, verse 4-6, "But I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.100]   You know no God but Me, and beside Me there is no Savior.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.160]   It was I who knew you in the wilderness, in the land of the drought.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.140]   But when they had grazed, they became full.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.180]   They were filled and their heart was lifted up.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.900]   Therefore, they forgot Me."
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:21.580]   And that's our constant challenge because our life is getting better and better because
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.380]   we're living in a safe country.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.780]   We're not persecuted.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.540]   Air conditioning works fine today, right?
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.520]   Parking wasn't too far, right?
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.380]   People said hello to you when you entered, right?
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.900]   People aren't angry with you.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.100]   So life is good for the most part.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.580]   And I know superficially there's other stuff going on in your life, but for the most part,
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.100]   you're not desperate.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.900]   And as a result of that, maybe you're drifting.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.260]   Hebrews chapter 2-1, it says, "Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to what
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:57.660]   we have heard, lest we drift away from it."
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:06.460]   Can a Christian who lives in a constant drift have assurance of salvation?
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.540]   You can come talk to me if this disturbs you, right?
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.300]   You cannot.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.540]   You cannot.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.380]   Because, not because you're saved by your works, not because you have some emotion in
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:30.640]   your heart, but to be in a constant drift may be evidence that you don't believe.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:37.860]   To be in constant state of lukewarmness and to have accepted that, to be in constant state
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:44.940]   of apathy and to have accepted that as a normal part of your life could be evidence that you
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.300]   don't really believe.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:55.600]   Because if you really believe, time to time, the Holy Spirit is going to jolt you up.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.100]   Because He's going to remind us where we're headed.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.180]   We don't belong here.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.240]   This is not our home.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.780]   The Christ that we serve looks at this world and says, "It is condemned."
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:17.160]   And it's no different than Lot's wife, who as she is running, looking back with envy.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:23.000]   Hebrews 2.3, "How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?"
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.720]   How shall we escape if we're living in constant neglect?
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.920]   Do you know how we live in neglect?
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:35.720]   We fill our schedules with things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   That's how we neglect.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.560]   You don't sit there and we're just like, "Oh, I'm not going to think about God."
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.760]   You fill your mind with things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   So we binge on Netflix.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:53.800]   Every free time we have, we run to fill it with entertainment.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.720]   Constantly hanging out, doing things.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.000]   And again, none of these things in and of itself are evil.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.240]   But it is the cause of our neglect.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:09.520]   It is at the core cause of our drift and our apathy.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.160]   And we're living in that constant, because I don't want to be disturbed.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.160]   Like I like my life like that.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   I don't want anybody to tell me what to do, what not to do.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.240]   And so we can easily dismiss the speaker, dismiss this, and this is that Bible study.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:27.840]   But when we come to the communion table and we confess that God of the universe died for
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:35.200]   me and then he gave us a great commission to now go to the world, baptizing them in
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.520]   the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, teach them to observe all that I've
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.960]   commanded you, and then we say, "Maybe not me."
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:51.120]   You can't come to the communion table if you reject that, if you're apathetic toward that.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   I'm going to conclude with a quick fire, four different words of this communion table, just
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.640]   to kind of remind us.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.200]   There are four different words in different groups that use the term to describe the communion
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   table.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   One is the word sacrament.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   You've probably heard that before.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.200]   It comes from a Latin word to mean holy or sacred.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.160]   In 1 Corinthians 11.27 it says, "Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.640]   the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   Lord."
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.840]   Here the unworthy manner was talking about they were getting together and they weren't
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.760]   thinking about the poor people.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.000]   So they were eating and drinking and having fun, and then when the poor people came, they
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.400]   had nothing to eat and they couldn't care because they were self-focused.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.800]   Now here when it says unworthy manner, they didn't consider it sacred, and as a result
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.680]   of that in verse 30, it says people are actually dying.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.340]   It was completely symbolic, but it was given by the Lord.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.440]   Just because it's symbolic doesn't mean it's not sacred, just like the Old Testament sacrifices,
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.320]   just because it was symbolic didn't mean that God didn't care how you handled it.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.160]   Nadab and Nebihu, they came and were giving symbolic sacrifices, but because it was unauthorized,
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   what happened?
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.640]   Fire comes and consumes them.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:07.120]   So the communion table was two of the sacraments that God gave to be sacred.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:15.080]   So when you come to the table in an unworthy manner, meaning unrepentant, unrepentant of
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:24.000]   a self-centered, apathetic, uncaring, unforgiving, bitter heart, we participate in an unworthy
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.880]   manner.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.360]   So one, sacrament, it is sacred.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.840]   And so this sacred time that we have should cause the church to reflect.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.880]   Now you can say, you know what, my heart's not ready, apathetic, so I shouldn't participate
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   in it.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.040]   Not participating in it means that I am outside of the fellowship of the body of Christ.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.640]   I'm disconnected with Christ.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.240]   That's what it means.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:54.120]   So a believer can only participate in a worthy manner, and it is a cause of repentance in
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.120]   the church.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.680]   Sacrament, that's the first word.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.600]   Second, communion.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.240]   Communion is where we get the word kononia, togetherness.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.840]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 29, "For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.060]   the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:15.240]   That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep."
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:24.080]   Communion table, this communion table, is not to be done in isolation.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:29.260]   I hear and see more and more people say, "Oh, we want to have an intimate time of communion,
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.460]   just me and my friends."
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.660]   Communion was meant to be done in the context of the body of Christ, because it symbolizes
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.140]   all together.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.700]   In the early part of the church, we used to have one loaf of bread, and everybody kind
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.580]   of take a chunk of that to symbolize that we're breaking the body of Christ.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.940]   And then we realized that the bread just tasted too good, and then people were just chomping
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:53.340]   on it, and then it didn't convey what we wanted.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   So we got rid of it.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:45:01.460]   But the idea behind it is that the whole body of Christ are recognizing that we are one.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:10.260]   So if we come up here with bitterness of heart, unforgiving, holding grudges, unreconciled
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:18.180]   relationships, it says you're coming to the communion table in an unworthy manner.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.300]   People will always say, "Well, you don't know what they've done to me."
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.660]   And we talk about, again, the last 10 years, the gospel-centered this, gospel-centered
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.660]   that.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:33.820]   There is nothing that truly tests gospel-centeredness than when you feel wronged, how you treat
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:40.140]   people that you think wronged you, because that's at the core of the gospel message.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.060]   Sinners who are rebellious against God came and died for us.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.700]   So the communion table reminds us of that.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:52.260]   Thirdly, Eucharist, literally the word means good grace, and it's the word that is used
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.020]   to give thanks.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.740]   So the communion table is meant for people to come and to remember and to, as an act
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.740]   of worship, to give thanks.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:05.100]   First Thessalonians 5, 16, "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks,
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.180]   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.340]   This is God's will, to give thanks and worship.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:18.500]   Fifth and finally, the Lord's table, which is the term that we oftentimes use.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:24.900]   And the Lord's table, in that Asian culture, typically meant an opportunity for celebration.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:30.420]   So whenever people have weddings, it's followed by some sort of banquet.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.580]   You may have different kinds of food, different venue, different activity, but the intention
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.820]   behind it is celebration.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.100]   And so the Lord's table is an act of worship, and to celebrate.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:47.180]   It isn't simply meant to be an opportunity for us to weep and to repent.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.700]   That's to be done before you come up.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.300]   But the table itself is to remind us that we have reasons to celebrate.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:47:00.340]   And let me conclude with this, Revelation 19, 7-9, "Let us rejoice and exalt and give
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:05.320]   him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.860]   It was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure, for the fine
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.860]   linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.020]   An angel said to me, 'Write this, blessed are those who are invited to the marriage
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:19.260]   supper of the Lamb,' and he said to me, 'These are the true words of God.'"
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:24.140]   So participating in the Lord's table is a declaration of his death and resurrection.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.820]   It is a reminder to us that this is where we're headed.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.700]   It's the marriage supper of the Lamb, and this is a taste of what is coming.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:37.380]   And if we have forgotten about that, it is to remind us of that.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:46.860]   So this morning, as we come to the communion table, you know, before I open it up, you
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.340]   know, as a pastor, you know, I was talking to a pastor in India, you know, and saying,
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.580]   you know, it must be hard to minister over there because of persecution and all this
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.580]   stuff.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:02.060]   And he said, "Well, you know, where we are, we have sheep.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:07.900]   And they're in danger, so they're very eager to listen to the shepherd because you have
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.780]   one place where you eat, and in between you have wolves coming to get them.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.940]   And so when the shepherd says, 'We're going to go,' they're always running close by the
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.500]   shepherd to get them to the other side to eat."
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:22.980]   He said, "But we know who our sheep is, and our sheep are eager to move."
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.460]   You know, he said, "But where you are, you're in the city.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.300]   You're trying to guide the sheep through the city where there's trash everywhere, and there's
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.100]   red lights and honking, and every turn you have, you have another one just kind of going
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.140]   down the street distracted."
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.940]   And so it's hard to move your sheep, and oftentimes don't even know who your sheep are, even in
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.420]   the same church.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.780]   That's where you and I are.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:54.940]   We're in the big city with so much destruction constantly, even today.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.980]   I want to challenge you.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:06.260]   Think practically about what you're entertained by.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.740]   Think practically.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.780]   Don't make these big judgments about, "I want to love Jesus.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.140]   I want to follow Jesus.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.100]   I want to do great things for Jesus."
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.700]   And then you go, and you spend the next three hours doing things that have nothing to do
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:24.780]   with God, and then that desire is gone already.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.540]   Our biggest challenge are not the wolves.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.540]   It's not Taliban.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.620]   It's not the US government.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.620]   That's not our biggest problem.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:40.940]   Our biggest problem is constantly being distracted by the honking, and the trash, and the smell
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.380]   that constantly gets our attention.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:51.940]   And we take our eyes off of where we're headed and where we're going, and we don't have an
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.300]   appetite for the things of God when we come.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.020]   So I want to challenge you and encourage you.
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.500]   Don't make commitments that are broad and big, because you're not going to follow through
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.380]   on that.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:11.340]   What were you watching this week?
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.100]   Where did your money go?
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:19.740]   What did your conversations with your friend, your Christian friend, sounded like?
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.700]   What are you looking forward to?
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.940]   Is it some trip that you're headed?
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.380]   Is it something that you're wanting to buy, and that's kind of filled your heart?
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.380]   What idols?
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.660]   What are the sins that so easily entangles you today?
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.660]   Think about that.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.740]   Think practically.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:45.860]   How can I stir up a hungering and thirsting for God today that's going to lead me to remain
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:46.900]   focused on Christ?
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:51.220]   So as we open up this communion table, again, I'm going to ask you guys to take some time
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.300]   to evaluate.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.740]   And don't say, "All my friends are doing it."
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:59.000]   Sometimes the church could be the biggest hindrance of genuine love for Christ.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.940]   So don't use your friends and your environment as an excuse.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.540]   If you hear the voice of Christ, follow Him.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.140]   Don't follow me.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.300]   Don't follow your friends.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.580]   Don't follow your small group leaders.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.900]   Follow Christ.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.460]   So let's take some time.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.100]   I want to invite our worship team to come up.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:31.980]   Take some time to prepare your hearts for the communion table.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.180]   The scripture says, "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.580]   Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed took bread.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:41.980]   And when He had given things, He broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.140]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.420]   In the same way also He took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.460]   in the blood.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.540]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.'"
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:52:00.980]   Heavenly Father, as we come before you to remember what Christ has done, may His sacrifice
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:06.600]   have a deep effect in our thoughts, our lives, what we pursue.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.300]   Help us, Lord God, not to simply confess with our mouth that you are our treasure, but it
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.180]   would be evident, Lord God, in all that we do.
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.860]   We pray, Father God, that you would bless this church through this time.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
