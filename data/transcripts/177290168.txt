[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   If you could turn your Bibles now to Romans chapter 6.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.960]   We're going to be reading verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.600]   It's really connected to the rest of the chapter, but we're going to just begin with 1 through
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.080]   4 this morning.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.580]   Romans chapter 6 verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.580]   What shall we say then?
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.800]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.900]   By no means, how can we who die to sin still live in it?
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.840]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.140]   His death?
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.160]   We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.880]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in a newness of life.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.960]   We thank you, Father, for your patience.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.240]   We thank you for your goodness.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.120]   We thank you for our church, our brothers and sisters that you've placed us in this
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.180]   family, this community, Lord God, where we can pursue and honor you with all our heart.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.180]   We pray for soberness.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.000]   We pray for energy.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.480]   We pray for the Holy Spirit, Lord God, to continue to intercede and groan on our behalf
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.460]   to long for the Father.
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.400]   We want to hear from you and you alone that we may hear your Son's voice and follow Him.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.800]   So we pray for your grace this morning.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.920]   Amen.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.360]   You know, when I think about my childhood, one of the things that I remember the most
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.160]   vividly was the first time my parents came to the United States in 19...
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.560]   My dad came first in '74 and I came in '75.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.360]   So you can imagine, you know, Korea at that time being such a poor country and then coming
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.400]   to the United States, it was well-developed and, you know, the streets are large.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.700]   It was exactly as I pictured it in my head or at least heard about and how everybody
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.340]   was filthy rich, you know, and you can have all the food you want and all the bananas
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.340]   you want.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.760]   I remember the very first memory of my childhood when I came was, it was the first Halloween.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.560]   You know, the first Halloween in Korea, you know, it was, again, it was a very poor country
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   at that time.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.800]   And, you know, I remember very rarely having candy.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.600]   And every once in a while if my mom wanted us to do something, my mom would tease us
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.160]   with, you know, that she would give us sugar water, basically put some sugar into the water
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.480]   and then so that I could drink that.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.520]   And that was our form of candy, okay?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.120]   Yeah, I'm a fop.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.920]   So that's how...
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   That's what I remember.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.760]   And then coming to the United States and saying, "Oh, there's Halloween."
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.280]   And then we had a cousin who was here in Philadelphia and told us that if you wear some sort of
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.400]   a mask and you go door to door and knock, they give you free candy.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   So I was like, "What?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.880]   This is great country."
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   So we didn't have a mask.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   We didn't know what it was.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.600]   I just remember getting the paper bag.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.880]   And my older brother was too embarrassed so he wouldn't come.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.800]   So me and Phillip got this bag.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.440]   And we only had one bag.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920]   So we put, you know, faces on it.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.800]   And then so I would first wear it and go knock on the door and then get some candy.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.160]   And then I would give that back to him.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.320]   And then he would go and knock and then come back and we'd get some candy.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.560]   I remember coming back, we had about a half a bag full of candy.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.680]   Looking back at it now, it wasn't a lot of candy compared to what the kids get today.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.600]   But that was free.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.920]   You know, it's like, "Wow, this is an awesome country.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   They just give you free candy for wearing a paper bag."
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   You know?
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.440]   And I just remember that's one of the most vivid memories that I have of our childhood,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   just how happy I was.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.280]   And then that happiness lasted for a long time because that candy was in the kitchen
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280]   for a long time.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   You know?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.560]   But the other memory that I have is much later on in high school when I became a Christian.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   In 1983 when I met the Lord, everything that I knew before I went up to the retreat was
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.560]   completely flipped upside down.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.840]   You know, my love for baseball at that time, you know, I was like obsessed with baseball
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   at that time.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.120]   I was outside playing baseball, practicing, trying to make it to the baseball team.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.680]   And that's all I did all day, all night.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   You know?
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.480]   And then all the anger, the bitterness that I had from moving around so much, and especially
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.880]   as a teenager, just instantaneously.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   I remember when I met the Lord, it just completely changed overnight.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.720]   And I know a lot of people go through counseling and all this stuff, but for me, it was instantaneous.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.040]   As soon as I met the Lord, I knew knowing that God had a purpose for all of that, it
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   changed everything.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.000]   But I also remember during that period, I had quite a few friends who became Christians
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.680]   at the same time, who are no longer walking with the Lord.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.320]   You know, and it didn't take long for them to fall away.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.380]   Some of them fell away a year after, some of them fell away several years after.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.360]   Every once in a while, I'll run into them, and I would ask them how they're doing.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.880]   And obviously, they've drifted away.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.600]   Some of them never graduated high school, some of them never graduated college.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.880]   And when I asked them about where they stand with God, they'll tell me confidently that
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.520]   if they die, they're going to go to heaven.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.840]   And so I asked them, like, what is that confidence based on?
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.460]   It's like, well, because it's not by works.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.640]   It's by the grace of God.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.400]   At that time, the way the gospel was being taught, it was almost kind of like Halloween.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.760]   I mean, I'm not saying that where I got saved, it was like that.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.880]   But a lot of people understood the gospel message as just free salvation.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.360]   You just go and raise your hand, come down the aisle, and you're done because it's by
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.800]   grace, not by works, right?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.200]   Well, isn't that what Paul said?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.320]   Didn't Paul himself say that where sin increased, grace abounded all the more?
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   So when Paul began to give this message, some of the people were saying that he's actually
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   telling people to sin.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.560]   He says that in Romans 3, 8.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   Why not do evil that good may come as some people slanderously charge us with sin?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.160]   So some of them were hearing this and wait a second, we've been living all our lives
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.720]   to earn righteousness before God.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.180]   And Paul is saying that that not only does that not give you righteousness, it only brings
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.180]   condemnation.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.440]   That the law, all it did was reveal a greater part of sin.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.920]   And even the passage that we just looked at before in Romans 5, 20, now the law came to
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.000]   increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.960]   Now if Paul's gospel, if the gospel of Jesus Christ ended there, yeah, it would make sense.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.440]   A lot of people would just kind of go off and say, yeah, I mean, of course we should
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.280]   live righteously, but living righteously is not required.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   I mean, we can almost say that wouldn't that lead to that then?
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.680]   Aren't we afraid when we're raising our kids that if we like to spoil them, they're going
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.720]   to grow up and thinking like, well, you know, I could do whatever I want.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.040]   I never get punished, right?
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.400]   Whether I go to school or don't go to school, get good grades, don't go get good grades.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.840]   I mean, imagine raising your kids, telling them constantly that no matter what you do,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.640]   that I love you.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.480]   Not to say that's not true, but imagine if that's the only message that you give them,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.640]   there's no consequences to your behavior.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.760]   Imagine what that child is going to grow up to be.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.160]   So if we're not careful, that same kind of thinking, that's where the Jews were afraid
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   of.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.040]   That's what the Judaizers were afraid of.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   Paul, if you are saying that salvation is by grace and by grace alone and not the law,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.880]   the righteousness doesn't add to your salvation, isn't that going to get a bunch of people
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.220]   who are just committed to licentiousness and they're going to do whatever they want?
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.000]   And so some people were actually saying that's the gospel that Paul was preaching.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.560]   Sad to say, some people today actually believe that that's what the gospel is.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.840]   The gospel basically frees you from any obligation for righteousness.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.800]   That no matter what you do in life, it just doesn't matter.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.320]   Paul says in verse one, in fact, the whole chapter six and chapter seven is to answer
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.880]   that question.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.440]   Some people were saying that that's what the gospel is.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.220]   Absolutely not, he says in verse one.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.220]   What shall we say then?
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.240]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.560]   By no means, right?
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.760]   In English, you can't use two negatives, right?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.560]   At least that's the grammar that we learn in English class.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.480]   But in the Greek, oftentimes there's two negatives that are used for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.240]   That's exactly what he does here.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.820]   The word by no means in Greek has two negatives, basically no, no, no, basically.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.820]   Absolutely not.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.880]   How can we who die to sin still live in sin?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.160]   If the whole point of the gospel is to deliver us from our own sins, how can somebody continue
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   to live in sin?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.880]   That is a contradiction of its terms.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.320]   That is a misunderstanding of what the gospel is.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.560]   So for the next two chapters, chapter six and chapter seven, Paul's going to be expounding
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.360]   and trying to qualify, yes, salvation is by grace alone.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.960]   And it is not by your righteousness.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.440]   It is not by your works, by grace and grace alone.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.880]   But when you are genuinely saved by grace alone, when your sins are justified by the
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.780]   blood of Christ alone, it does not lead to licentiousness.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.460]   It actually leads to greater righteousness, even in practice.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.840]   And that's basically the premise that when we look at chapter six and seven, that's the
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.240]   argument that he's going to make.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.300]   But today I want to look at the first four verses where he talks about how can we continue
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.180]   to sin when we have died to sin?
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.940]   First and foremost, the question that he's trying to answer here, is it a practical question
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.820]   or is it a positional question?
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.340]   I don't know if you understand what I mean by that.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.220]   Let me explain.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.460]   The question that he's posing, the answer that he's giving, is he basically challenging
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.780]   us that because of salvation, you should live righteous lives?
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.300]   Or is he saying that you've been delivered from sin?
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.220]   That's your position before God.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.600]   The answer to that is both.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.700]   But the first thing that he deals with is where we stand before God.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.700]   What happened to you?
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.540]   Before he gets into, therefore, since this is what happened to you, this is how you ought
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.540]   to live.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.900]   But first and foremost, we need to understand what salvation is in the first place.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.260]   What took place in salvation?
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.620]   And until we understand where we stand before God and what actually happened in salvation,
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.660]   how do you live up to the calling of your salvation if you don't understand exactly
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.220]   what happened?
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.340]   Some people think that salvation basically means that your penalty of sin has been paid
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:41.540]   for so you no longer go to hell, but that now you're just going to go to heaven.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.240]   Nothing has changed in you.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.360]   The only thing that changed is where you stand before God positionally.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.920]   But that is not true.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.640]   The first and foremost, Paul takes the first part of this passage to expose it to us.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.800]   What happened at your salvation?
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.200]   Again, so if we don't understand that, you won't understand what he means by live up
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.840]   to the calling when we get to Ephesians chapter 4 later on.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.480]   So what again, what does he mean by that?
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.120]   What shall we say?
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.000]   If some people are saying this, that our righteous life doesn't matter, that we can live in sin
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.880]   and still be saved, what shall we say?
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.160]   Are we to continue on sin that grace may abound?
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.480]   By no means.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.480]   Absolutely not.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.180]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.360]   John makes it very clear in 1 John 3, 4 to 6, everyone who makes a practice of sinning
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.720]   also practices lawlessness.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   Sin is lawlessness.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.460]   You know that he appeared to take away sins and in him there is no sin.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.520]   No one who abides in him keeps on sinning.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.360]   No one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.560]   So first thing that we need to distinguish what Paul is distinguishing here is somebody
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.920]   who is living in sin versus somebody who is wrestling in sin.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920]   Let me say that again.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.580]   Someone who is living in sin versus someone who is wrestling in sin.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:11.360]   So if you notice here he says, how can somebody continue to sin that grace may abound?
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   By no means.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.520]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.440]   So he's describing an individual where there was no change in life.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.320]   But after you met Christ, the life you lived prior to meeting Christ and the life you lived
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.400]   after you met Christ, there is no distinction.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.920]   You're still pursuing after the same sin.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:36.200]   That your life, your language, your thoughts, your hopes, your values, nothing has really
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.760]   changed other than the fact that you go to church on Sunday.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   That your confession has changed.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   But your life hasn't changed.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.320]   He said, how can that be?
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.400]   How can somebody who declares to have been delivered from sin continue to sin?
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.240]   That's the question that Paul is asking.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.600]   Obviously, the answer is he cannot.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.560]   In Romans 6, 12-14 it says, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies."
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.960]   In other words, Paul is not simply telling us that if you've been Christian that you're
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.680]   not going to struggle with sin.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.480]   Just automatically that those desires disappear.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   Is that true?
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.760]   When you became a Christian, did your pride just die?
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.080]   Did your lust just disappear?
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.280]   I met Christ and then boom, I had no desire.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   Is that true?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.480]   Some of you are saying no.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   You should all be saying no.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.840]   Let's be honest.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.800]   It didn't just disappear.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.600]   There's a reason why the Bible has imperatives.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.140]   There's a reason why there's commands in the scripture.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.760]   Like even Paul in the very next section, he says, "Do not present your members to sin
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.600]   as instruments for unrighteousness."
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.400]   Paul is not saying that you've been delivered from sin.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.160]   You've died to sin, so therefore you don't have any desire for sin.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.560]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.080]   Because if that's the case, he wouldn't be making the command to not to present your
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.000]   members to sin.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.420]   In fact, in Philippians 2.12, it says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.260]   It means that you need to work it out.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.220]   You need to identify what the sins are and you need to avoid it.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.120]   1 Corinthians 9.27, "But I discipline my body and keep it under control, as after preaching
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.260]   to others, I myself should be disqualified."
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:32.460]   So Paul describes even his own spiritual life as wrestling with his own flesh to conquer
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.280]   sin.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.600]   So Paul is not saying that we've been delivered from sin, that we died to sin.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.080]   He's not saying that you're not going to be struggling with sin anymore.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:49.240]   But there is a difference between struggling with sin and living in sin.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.020]   Douglas Moo, who is the leading scholar of the book of Romans, and he says this about
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.280]   this particular passage.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.640]   He says, "The imperative thou shalt would be futile and frustrating demand without the
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.400]   thou hast of the indicative."
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.320]   Let me say that so that it's easier to understand.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:15.120]   The command to do something would be absolutely frustrating without the revelation of what
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   has happened to you.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   To make it simple.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.600]   In fact, if you read the scriptures, you'll find that the Bible always lays out first
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.960]   and foremost what happened.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.640]   Romans chapter 1 through 11 is about what happened to you.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.080]   When you met Christ, when you confessed your sins to Christ and your sins were justified,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.520]   what happened to you?
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   Hebrews chapter 1 through 11, when you met Jesus Christ and He became your High Priest,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.480]   what happened to you?
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.480]   First 11 chapters.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:54.840]   Ephesians chapter 1 through 3, first 3 chapters, is what happened to you.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.320]   And that Paul is praying as he's expositing how he pursued you and loved you and he adopted
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   you.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.360]   And then he'll jump into Romans chapter 12, "Therefore, in view of this mercy of God,
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.720]   that this is what you ought to do."
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.920]   Ephesians chapter 4, "In conclusion of knowing three chapters of revelations of what happened
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.160]   to you, therefore live up to the calling that you have received."
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.000]   And we get to Hebrews chapter 12, after 11 chapters of exposition of what happened to
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.640]   you, chapter 12 continues on and says that we ought to continue to live, to fix our eyes
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.280]   upon Jesus, author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.400]   So in every instance, before we get to the imperatives of this is what you ought to do,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.760]   it tells us first and foremost who we are, what has happened.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.560]   So the first thing that he points out, if you think that just by preaching salvation
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.520]   by grace is going to automatically lead to the sentience, do you not know that first
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.080]   and foremost that you died to sin, died to sin.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.540]   Not only did you die to sin, he says you have been baptized into his death.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.320]   We have been united with Christ and baptized into his death.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.640]   So this morning I'm going to look at those two phrases and what that means.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.220]   So the first phrase when he says, do you not know that you are dead to sin?
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:20.240]   The very first thing that happens to a Christian when he meets Christ is that he dies.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.440]   I know that everything that we talk about is about receiving eternal life, that Christ
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.680]   came to give us abundant life, right?
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.440]   God so loved the world, gave his only begotten son, whoever believes in him shall not perish,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.000]   but have eternal life.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.500]   So all about Christianity, all about our hope is about life.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.000]   But before we have life, there is death.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.120]   And that's why Jesus Christ says, if you want to live, if you want to follow after me, pick
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.000]   up your cross and also follow me.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Because the path to life was through the cross.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.660]   Path to life was first and foremost death.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:03.060]   When we confess our sins before God for justification, we're not just confessing that we feel sorry
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.120]   for our sins.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.960]   There's a lot of things that we do we feel sorry for.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.200]   There's a difference between feeling sorry and repentance.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.440]   Feeling sorry is how you feel.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.240]   Christians and non-Christians feel sorry for what they do.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.560]   Non-Christians commit crime and they stand before the judge and they say, I'm sorry,
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   right?
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.720]   That's not repentance.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.920]   Repentance is not feeling bad for something that you did.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   Repentance literally means to change your mind.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.600]   There has been a change, a radical paradigm shift that whatever it is that you were doing,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.560]   whatever life that you were living was wrong.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.960]   That you were pursuing the wrong thing, that you were worshiping the wrong God, that you
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.160]   were living the wrong way, that you were acknowledging that you were an idolater.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.680]   So repentance isn't simply feeling sorry that I did that.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.080]   Repentance basically is to take my life that you were living and to crucify with Christ
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.480]   that you may live a new life.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.800]   See that's justification.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.640]   So what Paul is saying, how can somebody who has genuinely been justified and says, and
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.400]   genuinely repented and said, you know I've been crucified with Christ, how can he continue
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   to live on sin?
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.680]   That would be a contradiction.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.480]   That's why Paul himself says in Galatians 6.14, "But far be it from me to boast, except
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:34.360]   in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.840]   and I to the world."
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.760]   That's the beginning of salvation.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.560]   Beginning of salvation is when we are crucified to the things of the world.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.520]   We are no longer of this world.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.840]   Paul says that before we were justified in our sins, that we were under the reign of
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.720]   this sin.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:00.200]   That everything that we had, every inclination, every thought, every desire was tainted by
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.420]   this sin.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:09.080]   But when we met Christ and we confessed our sins to Jesus Christ, the world and all that
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:15.120]   we were pursuing, all that we valued, had been crucified, was put to death along with
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.920]   Jesus Christ.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   That's the evidence of genuine salvation.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.000]   One of the books that made the biggest impact that I enjoyed reading more than anything
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.880]   else, probably in the last 30 years, was a book from Jonathan Edwards called Religious
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.400]   Affection.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.680]   In that book, he's trying to describe a revival that was taking place during his time period.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.240]   A lot of people were saying, "Oh, that's not real.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.160]   Everybody's just getting emotional."
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.440]   He writes an article, at that time an article basically was a book, and he writes this article
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.680]   explaining what is genuine affection and what is false affection.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.080]   What is genuine worship and what is false affection.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:01.440]   So he takes half of the book describing like what, like all this emotions and religious
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.440]   duty and all of this.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.040]   You can do all of that and not be genuinely saved.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.240]   And then he, second part of the book, he describes what genuine affection looks like.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.720]   And at the top of the description, at the top of the test of whether someone was genuinely
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.440]   saved or genuine revival was taking place, he said first and foremost is a change of
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.080]   affection.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.320]   Change of affection.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.100]   A longing for something new.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.480]   That you no longer long for the things of the world, but that your longing has changed.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.200]   If non-Christians are described as people who are blinded so that they do not see the
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.680]   glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.480]   That's a description of a non-Christian.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.680]   A description of a Christian is a person whose the blinds have been taken away and now they
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:55.520]   see this glory that we've been separated from for all of human history.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.100]   Just like it says in Romans 3, 23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory."
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.600]   So we haven't seen this glory.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.720]   We don't know what this glory is and it's the most glorious thing that you and I could
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.920]   ever experience.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.760]   Because that's the source of life.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.360]   That's the source of hope.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.600]   That's the source of comfort.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.720]   That's the source of our food.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.240]   That's the source of living water.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.320]   So we didn't see that and all of a sudden our blinders get taken away and we see that
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.820]   and once we see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the world is no longer the same.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.040]   It's no longer the same.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:38.280]   So in other words, what Paul is saying is, if you have truly been justified, the world
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.960]   has been ruined for you.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.080]   It's ruined.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.300]   You can't go back.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.920]   You can't go back and enjoy the world like you used to if your eyes truly were opened.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.720]   If you've truly tasted the goodness of God, you can't simply turn that off and say, "You
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   know what?
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.440]   I'm going to go and have it all."
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.880]   Isn't that where your frustration comes from?
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.920]   Isn't that what you and I struggle with as a Christian?
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.720]   Is that we want Jesus and we want the world too.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   We want Jesus and we want all that the world has to offer without trying to walk that fine
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   line.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.000]   You can have as much as you can without having to sin.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.400]   Isn't that where the frustration comes when Jesus says that you cannot have two masters?
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.720]   Maybe you serve mammon or you serve God and somehow we're thinking that somehow we're
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.520]   going to find a trick that we can do both when Jesus clearly says that that cannot happen
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   and it won't happen.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:47.000]   He says, "But an individual who has truly been justified, his eyes have been opened
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.960]   to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.600]   As Jonathan Edwards says, "Your affection has changed.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.840]   What you knew before has been crucified along with Christ."
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.760]   The things of sin, the reign of sin has been crucified along with Christ.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.300]   We're no longer the same.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.580]   Our nature has changed.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.760]   He didn't just take somebody who was headed to hell and say, "You know what?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.480]   We're going to pay the penalty and now you can go to heaven."
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.800]   Our very nature has changed.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.960]   That's why the Bible describes as whoever is in Christ, he is a what?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.360]   A new creation.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.700]   He's a new creation.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:30.320]   When Jesus says that you cannot put old wine into new wine or old wine sin because old
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.600]   wine sin is going to break.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.440]   He's talking about the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.460]   In order for the Holy Spirit to come and make an indwelling in us, we have to become new
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.160]   creation.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.240]   So when Jesus died for us on the cross, he made us new creation so the Holy Spirit can
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.320]   come and make an indwelling in us.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:54.140]   So when we become Christians, our affection changes.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.580]   And that's what Paul means first and foremost when he says that you have died to sin.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.500]   How can someone continue to live in sin?
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:09.380]   How can someone who continue to live in the pattern of this world, if your sins have been
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:15.060]   crucified with Christ, if you've been delivered not only from the penalty of sin, but also
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.100]   delivered from the power of sin.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.360]   The world is no longer the same.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.320]   And I think every Christian in this room, every true Christian in this room will know
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.460]   exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:36.240]   Whether you are living in obedience or not, whether you feel like you're in the center
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.960]   of the will of God or not, whether you feel intimately close to God or not, you know exactly
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.480]   what I'm talking about.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.800]   That life is found at the center of His will.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.020]   And you know that if you're not living at the center of His will, something's out of
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.640]   whack and you're trying to fix it.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.520]   You're trying to fix it in every other way other than to come to God.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.160]   You're trying to fix it by your marriage.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.520]   You're trying to fix it by more money.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.200]   You're trying to fix it by traveling.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.560]   You're trying to fix it by other means.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.760]   But if you are a genuine believer in Christ, you already know that your nature has changed.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:17.120]   That the only place where you feel alive is when you're at the center of the will of God.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.080]   So an individual who confesses to be justified in faith and then continue to live in sin
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.000]   is a contradiction.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.240]   You're trying to do two things at the same time when Jesus said it is impossible.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.640]   So that's why Paul says it's like, "That's not possible."
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.040]   You're saying, "I'm not going around telling people that you can sin."
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.040]   I'm not.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.000]   Paul says that's not the case at all.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.240]   In fact, those who have been genuinely delivered will pursue more passionately the things of
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.200]   God than even before.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.520]   See, the Pharisees pursued righteousness so that other people can see.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.960]   Pharisees prayed so that they can compete with each other to see who's going to be praying
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.800]   more.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.480]   Pharisees even evangelized because that's how they measured whether someone was holy
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   or not.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:12.760]   See, but in the new covenant, an individual whose affection has changed.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:18.120]   I do what I do because that's where I find life.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.320]   That's where I find joy.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   That I don't do this because of expectation.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   I don't do this because that's a standard or that's because of accountability alone.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.520]   I do this because that's the desires of my heart.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.440]   God changed my desire.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.320]   You know, people always say, "Pastor Peter doesn't like Chinese food."
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   I love Chinese food.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.080]   Let me make that very clear to everyone.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.240]   I love Chinese food.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.440]   I don't like food in China.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.400]   That's the difference.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   I love Chinese food.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.160]   I don't like food in China because all these years I've been going out to China, I don't
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.400]   want to ruin it for all of you, but I've seen a lot of things.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.960]   I've seen where they cook their food.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.680]   I've had strange things coming in my mouth.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:11.800]   We had a whole team one summer hospitalized and had to get IV for several days as a result
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.240]   of delicious food, right?
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.520]   And so it's not Chinese food that I don't like.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.160]   It's when I'm in China, I'm a lot more cautious.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:30.000]   So when I go there, when I look at the Chinese food, it's like, "Oh, smells great."
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.320]   You know, but it just doesn't incite in me, "Oh, I want some of that."
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.240]   I lost the desire because I know what's in that thing.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.920]   My eyes have been opened.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.680]   And once my eyes have been opened, I can't shut it.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.240]   It's just no longer the same.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.880]   And in the same way, the Bible says that once your eyes have been opened and you really
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:02.000]   understand what this world is about, that this world is under condemnation, under the
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:10.520]   reign of the penalty of sin, and the wrath of God is being revealed in everything, in
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.200]   everything that you pursue, everything that this world is thrown at you as temptation,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.040]   all of that is under condemnation.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.640]   So it no longer has the same kind of appeal.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.320]   And so once our eyes have been opened, the reason why we come every Sunday to worship
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.280]   God is because He is more worthy than anything else that we see.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:37.680]   So when He says, "An individual who has truly been justified, he has been crucified, even
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   in the sin."
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.800]   So how can you be continuing to live in sin?
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.200]   An individual who feels comfortable in the world, an individual who feels right at home
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.280]   in the world, and he feels uncomfortable at church, that may be evidence that his eyes
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   never been opened.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:30:01.160]   See, a believer, where his eyes have been opened, even in the struggle, no matter how
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:08.440]   hard and difficult it becomes, we can never turn away, because there is no other way.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.560]   No matter how difficult, no matter how many relational problems you have, no matter how
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.340]   frustrating it may get, and in the end, we persevere.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.480]   We have to persevere, because there is no other way.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.760]   But not only does He say we have died to sin, He says, "Do you not know that you have been
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.260]   baptized into Christ Jesus, baptized into His death?"
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.520]   We always talk about His new life, but before we talk about new life, we have to understand
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.480]   our death in Christ.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.080]   Before Jesus was resurrected, He was first crucified.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.280]   So when He said, "Come, follow me, and pick up your cross," He was also telling us, "You
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.960]   have to come through the cross as well."
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.160]   The word "baptism" literally means to be immersed.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:55.760]   So those of you from Presbyterian backgrounds, explain that.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.960]   So baptism literally means to be immersed.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.560]   You're at a Baptist church, I'm safe here.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.720]   I grew up as a Presbyterian, my dad was a Presbyterian, but he's not here.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.600]   Baptism means to be immersed.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.000]   The word, so when we think of baptism, we think of the ceremony, like going into the
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.560]   water or the ocean, we're being immersed.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   But the word just literally means immersed.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:26.080]   And the reason why they use a baptism ceremony for conversion, and it wasn't unique just
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:31.280]   to Christians, they use a baptism ceremony for any time somebody was basically abandoning
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.840]   their old life, whatever it was, and they're becoming new, they're dedicating, they would
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.280]   go through this baptism ceremony.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.200]   It's just that John the Baptist came in and he basically Christianized this institution
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.400]   and it became a Christian activity.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.720]   But it wasn't unique to Christians at that time.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.560]   It was basically kind of like, whenever you graduate, you have this ceremony, or you're
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.600]   graduating to the next stage in life.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.560]   And so it was kind of that type of thing.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.320]   And then people would go into the water and come out, meaning that you're dying, your
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.660]   old self is dying and your new self is coming.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.080]   So when Paul says, "Do you not know that you have been baptized with Christ?"
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.680]   It means that you have been united with Christ, you have been immersed.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.960]   That when he died, you died with him.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.560]   And that's why in Galatians it says, "I've been crucified with Christ, it is no longer
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.520]   I who live."
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.400]   That's the first and foremost thing that every Christian needs to come to accept.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:32.520]   Until you and I have been crucified with Christ, even pursuit of righteousness can be a pursuit
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.200]   of our own ambition.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.120]   Even in the church.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.560]   Think about all the years of Christianity where corruption came into the church because
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.360]   worldly ambition followed along with certain people.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:53.540]   So the first and foremost, what Christ calls us to do is to be crucified with Christ.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.820]   That is no longer my life to live.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:04.320]   How much of our struggle, even today, is wrestling with, "What do I want to do with my life?"
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   That question in itself is what's getting you in trouble.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.640]   That question in and of itself is what's causing the frustration in your life.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.740]   It is no longer your life to live.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.360]   So that's not a question we should be asking.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.580]   What do I want to do with my life?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.800]   It doesn't matter what you want to do because it's no longer your life.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   The question ought to be, what does God want to do with this life that he purchased?
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.880]   It's no longer my life.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.080]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.720]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   Christ who lives in me.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.600]   So when he says, "Do you not know that you have been baptized?"
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:49.000]   You have been immersed, united with Christ in such a way that everything that happened
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.440]   to him happened to you too.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.880]   So what he is reminding us of is the presence and the union of Christ.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.720]   So a lot of times people come to church, there are things that you won't do here that you
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.080]   will do as soon as you leave.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.640]   And as a pastor, I know.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:12.160]   I know when I enter your car, everybody's radio station is 92.7.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.600]   The Christian radio, I know it wasn't there before.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.840]   I don't have anything against the other kind of music you listen to, but for whatever the
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.600]   reason, everybody feels like they need to turn on a sermon because Pastor Peter is getting
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   in the car.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   I know it.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.400]   I see you.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.600]   I see you when you're driving up.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   It's like you're switching the channels.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.440]   It's like, "Hey, that's okay.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   I'm okay with that.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   I listen to that too."
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   Right?
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:45.200]   But for whatever the reason, we think like, "Okay, this is a holy place because this is
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.920]   where there's a greater presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.840]   There's where Jesus is and where the leaders are, and so we're careful."
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.880]   But as soon as we go home and we're outside, like we're gone.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.720]   See, Paul is reminding us that our union with Christ is in every way, not just, "Oh, we
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.200]   got to say one day we're going to be with Jesus forever."
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.960]   He makes us indwelling in us.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.600]   We're that intimately tied with, we're immersed with Christ.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.080]   That's what it literally means to be baptized in Christ, means that we've been immersed.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.720]   We've been so united.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.040]   You know, you see two couples who've been together for so long and they had a good marriage,
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.240]   they start sounding alike.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.960]   They start eating, have the same appetite.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.920]   They start dressing alike.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.360]   I know some people that are like that, right?
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.840]   The longer you are together, you start to talk alike.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.600]   You start to have the ... One thing I noticed with Esther, Esther was not sarcastic when
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   we first met.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.320]   She's become a little bit more sarcastic.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.280]   I'll take credit for that.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.000]   There are certain things that I hated noodles, and then I started liking noodles.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.960]   When two people are together and so united that closely for that long, it kind of rubs
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.040]   off on each other.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.320]   She's saying, "Do you not know that somebody who's been justified has been united with
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.200]   Christ?"
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   He's been immersed.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.680]   It's not just, "Oh, we come to church and we dabble in Jesus."
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:18.140]   Every single Christian, the Holy Spirit makes an indwelling inside of you.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:22.240]   It's not like the old covenant where the Holy Spirit came and was upon people and then they
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   left.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.800]   He said, "Now the Holy Spirit makes an indwelling on you, and there is no place where the Holy
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.200]   Spirit does not dwell."
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.440]   As long as you are you, as long as you are alive, the Holy Spirit is in you, whether
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.560]   you are at church, whether I'm in your car or out of your car.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.040]   That's how intimately that we've been united with Christ.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.400]   So he's saying, "How can somebody who's been united with Christ all of a sudden continue
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.920]   to live in sin and feel safe?"
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.680]   That's a contradiction.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:37:07.880]   And that's why John Stott says of this, he said, "It's not that it's an impossibility
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:14.920]   for a Christian to wrestle with sin, but it's incongruous for a Christian to continue to
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   live in sin."
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.600]   In other words, it's not consistent.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.920]   It's like somebody saying, "I dress like a duck, smell like a duck, eat like a duck,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.520]   swim like a duck, but I'm a cow."
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   And that's what he's saying.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.640]   He's saying, "To act like a duck, eat like a duck, swim like a duck, and then go around
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.480]   telling people, 'I'm a cow, don't judge me.'"
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.400]   That's so judgmental.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.640]   Everybody's so judgmental.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.200]   But you're acting like a bird.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.480]   You're eating like a bird.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.100]   And then you go around telling people that you're a cow, and then you get all offended
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:54.600]   when you say, "I don't think you're a cow."
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.320]   In essence, that's basically what Paul is saying.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:04.720]   Paul is saying that our very nature has changed, and our union with him has changed.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.960]   That's why all throughout the New Testament, he reminds us, "We have been crucified with
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   Christ," Galatians 2.20.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.840]   "We have died together with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world," Colossians
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   2.20.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.220]   "We have been buried in baptism into the death together with Christ," Romans 6.4.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.540]   "We have been made alive together with Christ," Ephesians 2.5.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.940]   "We have been raised together with Christ," Colossians 3.1.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.740]   "We are fellow heirs with Christ," Romans 8.17.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.540]   "We are suffering along with Christ.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.740]   We will be glorified along with Christ."
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:41.980]   Over and over again, he says, "All our spiritual life is described as with Christ."
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   With Christ.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.740]   Do you remember Zacchaeus?
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.700]   He meets Jesus.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:55.060]   Jesus doesn't say, "You rotten tax collector, give away all your money.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.220]   How can you possibly live like that?"
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.220]   He doesn't say that.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.860]   Jesus says, "Let me come to your house."
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.180]   "Yes, come to my house."
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.700]   As soon as Jesus says, "Come to my house," remember what he says?
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:09.340]   "I'm going to give away half of my possession, and I'm going to pay back all that I've done
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.340]   wrong."
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.340]   Why?
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:17.060]   Simply because Jesus says, "Come into his house."
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.060]   Just because.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.060]   Because he knew.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.060]   "Here's this holy man coming to my house.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.740]   How can I possibly invite him to my house and keep doing what I'm doing?"
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.140]   Just by his presence.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.340]   Just by his presence, he repents.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.060]   And so that's what Paul means.
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:40.340]   If you have been justified by grace alone, this union with Christ isn't just on Sunday.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.100]   It isn't just in public.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.500]   24/7, he has made an indwelling in us.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:54.340]   And if you can see God living in sin, obviously we cannot.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.140]   That's why in 1 John 1, it says, "If we say that we have fellowship with him while we
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.860]   walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth."
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:09.100]   No one is deceived but ourselves.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:16.100]   Until we accept the fact that we are crucified, that we are dead to this world, we cannot
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.180]   live for him.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.100]   Because before we live, we have to die.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.300]   Before we live, we have to die.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.620]   The very things that causes the heartache in your life, isn't it the rat race?
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.340]   Isn't it the competition with your neighbors and your friends and your family members?
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:41.980]   The same thing that suffocated your life, the reign of death as Paul describes it.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.540]   Aren't those the things that have been suffocating you?
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.900]   Isn't that why you hold on to bitterness and anger?
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:54.540]   Isn't that why you have relational issues because yourself has been offended?
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:41:00.340]   Because the same things that killed us before we met Christ, we're holding on to dear life.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:04.560]   And then we're trying to hold on to that and while holding on to the new life in Christ,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.420]   no wonder we're frustrated.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:12.260]   See, he's not simply saying if you want to follow Jesus, just suck it up and do hard
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.260]   things.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.260]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:20.260]   He said, "I want to give you this new life, but until you can unite with Christ in his
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:28.540]   resurrection, you must first understand that you're united with Christ in his death."
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:34.380]   This life that you and I are trying so hard to do well and live in, and the pattern that
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.740]   this world has set, that's what's killing us.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:47.460]   True life is found in Christ when we see the filth in it, just like the food in China.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.780]   It was delicious the first year, and then every year after that, the food in China has
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.780]   gotten much better, just to be fair.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.820]   But I just can't get that out of my head.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.860]   I just cannot get that out of my head.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.100]   And I don't want to ruin it for you.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.020]   Those of you who visit China, it's awesome.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:11.740]   But all the things that I've seen all these years, it's just no longer the same.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.700]   But isn't the world the same thing?
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.340]   At the end of the day, the things that are tempting us, when we take a step back and
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:25.540]   look at it, do you not see the corruption in it?
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:32.060]   Do you not see the emptiness at the end of whatever it is that we're pursuing?
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:37.100]   Do you not see the futility of all the energy that the world is putting in to get to the
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.700]   next stage, and then how miserable they are as a result?
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.780]   And yet, when we're not fixated on Christ and how we're tempted by these very things
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:51.500]   that Jesus saved us from, that's what Paul is saying.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.580]   It doesn't lead to less anxiousness.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:43:00.500]   It leads to a greater desire for holiness, greater desire for worship, greater desire
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.780]   to magnify this Christ, to give life, give this life abundantly.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.460]   If you would take a few minutes to pray with me as we welcome the, pray seem to come up
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.460]   again.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:18.860]   If you guys can take a few minutes, again, to come before the Lord in genuine prayer,
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.540]   examine your own hearts.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.900]   Have I been pursuing empty things?
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.660]   Have I been frustrated because I've been trying to hold on to the world and God at the same
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:35.060]   time, and I guarantee you haven't been successful?
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:40.500]   I know you haven't been successful, because I know what God says is true.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.100]   You can't have both.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:48.780]   So if you've truly been crucified with Christ and you're dead to sin, the more we embrace
