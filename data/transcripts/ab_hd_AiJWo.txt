[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   - Good morning, welcome to Boone Community Church.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   Let me get a few announcements in.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   First of all, if you purchased a Korean fundraiser,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   a Korean Missions fundraiser sweatshirt,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   as you were coming in, you probably saw a table out there
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   with great shirts, or if you didn't see it,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   they're right by the cafe entrance and to the right,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   so you can go and pick that up.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   They do have about 10 left,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   so if you want to still buy it, the cost of it is $50,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   but they will be there after service
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   to make sure you go and pick that up.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   This coming Saturday at 10 a.m.,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   we have a Q&A on autism spectrum disorder,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   and so it is to kind of give resources to the families
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   or people who are interested in this
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   and want to learn about it.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   There will be people there, again,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   older families who've kind of wrestled with this for a while,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   and then there's some people who are working in that field,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.600]   and so they'll be taking some questions
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   from people who are interested in this,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   so please sign up for that.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   It's coming Saturday at 10 a.m.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   And then child safety training.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   Next coming Sunday,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   if you are working with children at our church,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   it is a requirement that you have safety training,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   and so if you are in need of that,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   that safety training is happening at 1:30 p.m.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   next Sunday in the sanctuary,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   so please mark that on your calendar
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   and please come right on time for that.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   And then newcomers lunch.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   If you are new to the church and you have questions
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   and you want to learn about the church,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   meet some of the leaders, this lunch is for you,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   and this is happening on March 2nd at 1 p.m.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   in the youth chapel, so March 2nd at 1 p.m.,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   so please sign up for that
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   so they can have a lunch ready for that.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   FAM 245 men's hike and seminar.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   So if you're part of the ministry
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   where you've been married three years or less,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   I think that's the criteria.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   On March 15th, there will be a hike and a seminar
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   that will follow after that in biblical manhood,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   and so please sign up for that,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   and there will be lunch provided,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   so just keep that on your calendar.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   This is on March 15th.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   And then on that same day at 2 p.m.,
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   so you can actually go to both
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   even though it may not be relevant for you,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   there's going to be a dating seminar.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   So it was a dating seminar.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   It is open to everybody.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600]   It started out with a ban,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   but then it will be open for college
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   and even for high school.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Married people have asked if they can come, right?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   And it's not to reevaluate their husband or wife.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   The people that they're counseling,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   they want to make sure that we're kind of on the same page
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   as they're assisting young couples who are dating.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   And so if you are interested in coming to that,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   it is open to the whole church.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   All three of the pastors will be involved with this.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   And so the topics will be what to look for--
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   sorry, biblical view of dating versus the world's practice, okay,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   what's happening today and how the culture practices dating
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   and what part of that is biblical,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   what part is not biblical, what's wise, what's not wise.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.600]   So the first session will be that.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   Second will be what to look for in choosing a partner,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   a godly partner, whether it's your wife or your husband.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   So second session is for that.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   And then third session we'll be taking Q&A.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   So all three pastors will be directly engaged in this.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   So please sign up for that.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   That's happening on March 15th at 2 p.m. through 5 p.m.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   in the main sanctuary.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   So that's a Saturday, okay?
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   All right, so I'm going to pray for the offering.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   And after our time of worship, our sister Jocelyn is going to come up,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   and she's going to give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   Let's pray.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   We ask, Lord God, that you would help us
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   as we are prone to be entangled with things of this world.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   Help us, Lord God, to see the eternal things that you have promised,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   that all that we have, all our hopes and our joys, Lord,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   rest upon the promises of God.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   Help us, Lord God, as we have come to worship you,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   to truly do it in a manner that is worthy of the calling that you've given,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.600]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   I pray that even in this giving,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   I pray that you would help us to give it as an act of worship,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   [music]
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   [music]
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   [music]
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   [music]
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   [music]
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   [music]
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   [music]
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   to greet the neighbors around us before we continue.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   [music]
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   [music]
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   [music]
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   [music]
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   Let's sing, "O Lord."
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   O Lord, my God,
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   when I in awesome wonder
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   consider all
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   the works thy hands have made,
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   I see the stars,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   I hear the rolling thunder
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   that bowed throughout
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   the universe displayed.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   Then sings, then sings my soul,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Then sings my soul,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   How great Thou art.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   And when I think,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   and when I think
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   that God is Son not spirit,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   sentenced to die,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   I scarce can take it
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   that on that cross
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   my burden gladly bearing
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   He bled and died
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   to take away my sin.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   Then sings, then sings my soul,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   Then sings my soul,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   Then sings my soul,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   When Christ shall come,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   when Christ shall come,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   what joy shall fill my heart,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   then I shall bow
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   with humble adoration
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   and there proclaim,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   my God, how great Thou art.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   Then sings my soul,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   Then sings my soul,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   my Savior God, to Thee,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   how great Thou art,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.600]   how great, how great Thou art,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   how great Thou art.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   Let's sing Rock of Ages.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   Rock of Ages,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   clap for me.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   Let me hide
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   myself in Thee.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.600]   Let the water
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   and the blood
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   from Thy wounded side
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   which flow,
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   be of sin
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   and double joy.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   Save from wrath
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   and make me pure.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   Not the limbs
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   of my hands
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   can fulfill
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   Thy lost demands.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   Curd my zeal,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   no rest will know.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   Curd my tears,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   for I will flow.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   All for standard,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   not at all.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   Thou my Savior,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   Thou alone.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   Nothing in my hand.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   Nothing in my hand I bring,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   simply to the cross I kneel.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   Make a God to me for trust,
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   helpless love to me for grace.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   Thou light to the mountain dark,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   wash me, Savior,
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   all my time.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   While I draw,
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   while I draw this bleeding breath,
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   when my life shall close in death,
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   when I soar to worlds unknown,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   see beyond my judgment throne.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   Rock of Ages,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   clap for me.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   Let me hide myself in Thee.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   Let's sing Rock of Ages.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   Rock of Ages,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   clap for me.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   Let me hide myself in Thee.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   Let the water and the blood
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   from Thy wounded side which flowed
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.600]   be of sin the double cure.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   Save from wrath and make me pure.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   Amen. May it be seated.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   Hi everyone. My name is Jocelyn
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   and this is my testimony.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   When I was younger, I had many fears.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   I feared death.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   I feared being taken away from my family
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   and I feared that my family would break apart.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   I, of course, had no reason to believe this,
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   but this feeling caused me to attach myself
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   to my parents wherever they went.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   Though my parents thought that I wanted to tag along
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.600]   or that it was a cute act their six-year-old did,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   I knew it was because I thought that if I didn't accompany them,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   something terrible would happen,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   like getting into a car accident.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   Again, nothing occurred to make me think this way.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   I thought I was protecting them.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   This fear intensified one day
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   when I accompanied my dad to an Albertsons
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   and I had an experience that prompted me
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   to even greater fears.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.600]   It started with a simple question.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   "Everything is okay, right?"
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   This simple question turned into one
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   that I would repeat multiple times a day,
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   seeking assurance.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   Seeing how this question became tiresome to answer,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   I quickly changed my compulsion.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   Instead, I would wash my hands, close the faucet,
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   and turn my head towards the mirror five times.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   If I touched anything on the way back to my room,
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   I would feel dirty and have to do the same thing all over again.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.600]   I now feared that if I didn't do certain actions,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   that it would be my fault if something happened to my loved ones.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   After completing these actions,
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   I would feel a sense of peace and calmness,
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   though it was clearly temporary.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   I spent 15 years feeling as if I carried the responsibility
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   over my family's safety.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   I grew up in a Catholic family,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   wearing a mask pretty much every Sunday.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.600]   I thought I knew who God was, and I thought I loved Him.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.600]   But ultimately, I realized I was living in tradition.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.600]   On the nights where my thoughts were too much to handle,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   I would pray and cry, asking God for His help.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   There was a moment where I felt His calmness and peace
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   envelop me after I prayed one day,
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   relieving me of my anxiety and drawing me to a restful sleep.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   Yet I did not fully comprehend the depth and value
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   of His death on the cross for me.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.600]   On March 13, 2020, I went to a church retreat.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   This was when lockdown first started.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   At retreat, I was able to fully spend time in the Lord's presence,
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   beginning to desire a more intimate and personal relationship with Him.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   When I went back home on March 16, 2020,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   I wanted to read the Bible and ask my mom to buy me one.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   Here, I began to comprehend what it meant for Jesus
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   to have died on the cross.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   I realized that Jesus Christ emptied Himself
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   by taking the form of a bondservant
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   and being born in the likeness of men
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   and being found in appearance as a man.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   He humbled Himself by becoming obedient
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   to the point of death on the cross.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   Philippians 2, 7 to 8.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   During those 15 years, I knew that Jesus was Lord and Savior,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   but seeing how I had lived my life in fear and anxiety,
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   I knew that it wasn't my truth.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   I didn't live my life trusting Him
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   or acknowledging His Lordship over my life.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   I thought I could save myself and my family
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   if I satisfied my compulsions.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   I thought I could dictate what would happen
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   to my family and me.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   The Lord, in His truth, led me to the freedom
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   found only through and in Him.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   Romans 8, 15 to 16 says,
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   "For you have not received a spirit of slavery
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   leading to fear again, but you have received
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   a spirit of adoptions as sons and daughters
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   by which we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   that we are children of God.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   After accepting Jesus as my Lord and Savior
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   and repenting over my sins,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   I felt an extreme amount of peace.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   I realized that all the times I felt uneasy
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   after sinning was because I was sinning
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   against a holy God.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   He had broken my chains of bondage to sin and fear
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   and transferred me into the kingdom
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.600]   of His beloved Son.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   He died for me even though,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   as Colossians 1, 21 and 22 says,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   "You were formerly alienated and hostile in mind,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   engaged in evil deeds, yet He has not reconciled you
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   in His fleshly body through death
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   in order to present you before Him
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   as blameless and beyond reproach."
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   Death truly lost its grip on me.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   My sister asked me if I was going to get therapy
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   for the anxiety and compulsions I had
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   at that point lived with my entire life.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   But I knew that Jesus' peace was all I needed,
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   no longer believing I had a say over my family's lives,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   no longer feeling like I needed to control everything,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   but trusting that my life is in the palm of His hands
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   and He could do with me whatever He wills,
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   for I am His.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   Jesus had taken my past, present, and future sins
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   upon the cross with Him,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   resurrecting on the third day and defeating death.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   He washed me clean more than any hand-washing
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   I had previously done could ever do.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   Instead, He was and is my peace,
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   my strength, and my comforter.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   By His grace, He saved me from my fearful life,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   and now the only fear my heart craves
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   is the fear of the Lord.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   Though He continues to sanctify me
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   and will do so until Jesus returns,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   purely by His strength I continue to surrender
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   my sins and my life to Him,
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   for I am a new creation in Him,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   striving to be His free prince.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   Thank you.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   [applause]
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   [indistinct]
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   [applause]
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   All right, thank you, Jocelyn, for that great testimony.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke, chapter 10,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   we're going to be reading from verse 21 through 24.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   Luke, chapter 10, verse 21 through 24.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   Just as a reminder, this is in continuation
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   of Jesus speaking to the disciples,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   70, that has come back.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   And then He tells them that they come back rejoicing
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   over the fact that even the demons
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   were subject to them in the name of Jesus.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   And then He tells them,
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   "If you're going to rejoice over anything,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   "rejoice over the fact that your name
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   "is written in the book of life, of your salvation."
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   And then this text turns around and says,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   "This is the cause of my rejoicing."
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   Okay, so that's the context.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   "At that very time He rejoiced greatly
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   "in the Holy Spirit and said,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   "'I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   "'that you have hidden these things
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   "'from the wise and intelligent
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   "'and to infants.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   "'Yes, Father, for this way
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   "'was well-pleasing in your sight.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   "'All things have been handed over to me
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   "'by my Father, and no one knows
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   "'who the Son except the Father,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   "'and who the Father is except the Son,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   "'and anyone whom the Son wills to reveal Him.'
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   "Turning to the disciples, He said privately,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   "'Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   "'For I say to you that many prophets and kings
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   "'wish to see these things which you see,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   "'and did not see them,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   "'and to hear the things which you hear,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   "'and did not hear them.'"
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   Let's pray.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   Father, help us to understand
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   not only your words but your very heart.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   Help us, Lord God, to hear from you
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   that your sheep, your children,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   will hear your voice and follow you.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.600]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   I want you to think just for a few seconds.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   What makes you the most happy?
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   Rhetorical question.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   Just think about it for a second.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   What brings the most joy in your life?
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   However you answer that question,
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   whatever brings the most happiness or joy in your life,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   you will sacrifice, pay, plan to have it
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   because our human nature is to pursue happiness,
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   whatever that happiness may be.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   If you like to travel,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   you make your whole year's calendar around traveling,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   that we're going to go here.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   You're saving up money,
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   and you're saving up all your vacation time,
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   and whatever it may be.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   Maybe you're a foodie,
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   and you find some food delicious out somewhere,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   and you risk your life to go to someplace gang-infested
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   because they have some $2 tacos that you want.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   Whatever it is, if that brings you pleasure,
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   you're willing to do whatever it takes.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   Maybe it's like watching sports.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   Because it brings you pleasure,
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   you memorize who's on what team and their stats,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   and you even know their shoe size
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   and what color brand is coming out.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   Because it brings you pleasure.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   Maybe it's watching movies.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   You know that some movie is coming out
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   that you've been waiting for for the last six months,
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   and you're waiting on the calendar,
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   and you're willing to stand in line for hours and hours
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   so you can get a better seat.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   Whatever brings you the greatest pleasure,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   you're more than willing to sacrifice,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   to put money down, do whatever it is.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.600]   As you guys know, last Sunday was Super Bowl,
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   and Super Bowl is the biggest watched sports event,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   at least in the U.S.,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   and that's why the advertisement on there is ridiculous.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   Millions of dollars for a minute of commercial time.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   They said that last week's Super Bowl,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   127.7 million people watched it.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.600]   That's more than a third of the country that watched it.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   The cheapest ticket to watch this game was $2,800.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   $2,800.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   Average cost of the Super Bowl ticket was $7,000.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   That's the average.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   The most expensive ticket, at least that they have record of,
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   and they might have been some privately sold things
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   that may have cost more than that,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   but at least that they have a record of,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   is $25,000 somebody paid to watch this game.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   Now, why are people willing to pay thousands of dollars
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   to watch grown men hit each other?
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   Right?
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   So if you don't like football, if you don't understand sports,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   you're just like, "What? They paid $25,000 for that?"
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   But if that sport brings you pleasure,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   you're probably thinking, "I wish I had that money.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   "I'd be willing. I would save that money."
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   And people travel from all over the country to just go
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   and spend thousands of dollars,
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   whether they can afford it or not, to watch this game.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   And the simple reason is because it brings them pleasure.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   But the question is, why does watching this sport,
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   why does watching anything bring pleasure?
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   I think the answer is pretty simple
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   because the Bible says that we have been created
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   to be image-bearers of God.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   Image-bearers basically means that we are to reflect
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   his glory of who he is.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   Let me put it another way.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   God has created us to be worshipers,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   that we find the greatest pleasure
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   when we are worshiping something greater than us.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   And I think whether it is sports
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   or whatever it is that we're attracted to,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   that where we are in the presence of something greater than us,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   for whatever the reason, it brings us great pleasure.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   But the problem is, the rebellion of mankind,
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   instead of living in the way to bring glory to God,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   to be worshipers,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   that we have pursued to be worshipped
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   rather than to worship.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   And as a result of that, we live our lives
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   wanting to be recognized, wanting to be a little bit better,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   constantly comparing and competing.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   And as a result of comparing and competing,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   we go out collecting.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   And we feel perfectly fine with our car
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.600]   until we see another person with a better car.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   We buy a decent house and we feel perfectly fine
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   until we visit our neighbor's house,
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   and then all of a sudden we don't have enough.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   Because at the root of who we are,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   in our rebellion against God,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   we have desire or pursuing
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   to be the center of attention.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   And you don't have to be an outgoing person
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   or introvert at the core of who we are.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.600]   That's why we go to school.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   That's why we save money.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   That's why we plan.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   Because we find pleasure in satisfying ourselves.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   The Bible tells us that God created us to be worshipers.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   And after six days of creation,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   He went into the Sabbath rest.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   And He brought us in with Him.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   And in His presence, we found peace and joy.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   In fact, Psalm 1611 says this,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   "You will make known to me the path of life.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   "In Your presence is fullness of joy,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   "and in Your right hand there is pleasure forever."
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   So He says, "In His presence, there is path to life.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.600]   "In His presence, there is joy.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   "In His presence, there is true pleasure."
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   But because the Bible says that all have sinned
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   and fall short of God's glory,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   instead of worshiping God,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   we have rebelled and desire to be the ones worshiped.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   That's why Satan, we talked about it last week,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   in his attempt to exalt himself,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   found himself exactly the opposite.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   Instead of ascending, he ended up descending to Sheol.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   And his temptation to Adam and Eve is,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   "If you eat of this," what did he say?
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   "You will be like God."
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   The very thing that caused him to rebel
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   and to be thrown out of heaven,
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   he tempts with Eve.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   And Eve gives it to Adam, and they fall out,
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   and they get separated from God.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   So the Sabbath is broken.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   And when the number of men began--
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   sinful men in rebellion began to multiply,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   what is the first thing that they do?
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   They begin to build this tower, Babel.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   And in this tower, they said they wanted to reach God.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   So at the core of man's rebellion
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   is his desire to exalt himself,
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   whether in a big way or in a small way.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   And as a result of his own desire to exalt himself,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   he has been separated from the author of life.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   The path of life, the fullness of joy,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   the pleasure forever has been disconnected
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   because we have been disconnected
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.600]   with the author of life.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   That's why when Jesus comes and he talks about life,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   he's not simply talking about existence.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   When he says, "I have come to give life
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   and give this life abundantly,"
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   he's not saying that somebody who dies
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   is just going to disappear.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   "I have given them so that they can exist forever."
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   Every soul exists forever,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.600]   whether that soul exists forever here or in judgment.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   So when he says he has come to give life,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   he's not simply saying somebody who didn't exist,
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   that he's going to exist forever.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   The word that is used for life here is "zoe."
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   There's two Greek words that's translated for life.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.600]   And one is "bios," where we get the word "biology,"
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   and that is the chronology of life.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   I am 10 years old, 50 years old, 100 years old,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   and we use the term "bios."
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   But in every instance the Bible uses the word "life,"
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   the word is "zoe."
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   "Zoe" is not simply existence.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.600]   "Zoe" is abundant life.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   So another way to understand the word "zoe"
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   is pleasure, life, and joy.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   So when Jesus says God so loved the world
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   that whosoever believes in him shall have eternal "zoe."
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   When he says he's going to give life, give this life abundantly,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   he says I'm going to give you "zoe," what you lost.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   Because of the Sabbath being broken,
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   he came back to restore.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   All our pursuits of wanting to find joy and pleasure
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.600]   is a replacement of what we have lost
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   because of our rebellion against God.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   So when Christ came to give us life,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   his primary reason why he came was to restore us.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   And so last week we saw that he says above all the things,
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   all these things that this power over demons
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   and ability to heal, he said that's great.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   But if you're going to rejoice over anything,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   rejoice over the real gift,
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   that your name is written in the book of life,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   of your salvation, that no one can take away.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   And then he turns it around and he says,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   "Let me tell you what I am joyful for."
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   So this text, we're going to look at the Trinity,
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   and what role they play in bringing this new life to us,
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   to this joy.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.600]   He begins the text by saying in verse 21,
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   "At that very time he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit."
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Now what does he mean by rejoicing in the Holy Spirit?
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   He just has an intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit?
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   He's just saying that he notices something about the Holy Spirit
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   and he says, "Man, the Holy Spirit makes me so happy."
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   No, in the context what he is saying is
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   the same thing that he told the 70 disciples who returned.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   If you're going to rejoice over anything,
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   rejoice over your salvation,
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   that your name is written in the book of life.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   And when he says he rejoices over the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   he's talking about the role of the Holy Spirit
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   in giving you eternal life.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   The Bible says in John 14.26,
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   "The Holy Spirit will remind us of the things of God."
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   So everything that Jesus said,
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   the Holy Spirit is the agent in which he begins to remind people,
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   begins to tell people.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   John 16.7-8, it says the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   when he disseminates the Word of God,
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   the Holy Spirit is the one who's going to convict people of sin.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   So you can sit here and hear the Word of God,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   and if there's any part of you that understands what's being said,
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   it's because the Holy Spirit is working.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   If the Holy Spirit is not working,
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   this is just some pudgy Asian guy just talking.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   That's all it is.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   You come in to put in your religious time,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   and you're thinking of lunch that's coming,
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   and you have plans, and get this over with.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   But if there's any part of you where the Word of God is going forth
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   and is molding your heart and you're hearing the voice of God,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.600]   he says that's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.600]   And then in Acts 1.8, it says the Holy Spirit is the one who empowers people.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   What causes these words become powerful enough
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   that somebody hears it, repents, turns their life around,
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   and gives it to Christ and begins to follow him
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.600]   and his destiny of eternity is changed forever?
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   That's not because I'm a good salesman.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   He says it's the power of the Holy Spirit that's working in you.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   In fact, Romans 8.16-17, it says the Spirit himself testifies
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   Our own assurance of salvation is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   And if children, heirs also, heirs of God, and fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   It is the Holy Spirit that reminds us, convicts us, empowers us,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   and testifies about our salvation.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   So when Jesus says, as you rejoice over your salvation,
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   I rejoice over the work of the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:43.600]   And then he says the Father is the one who initiates this joy, this life.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.600]   Verse 21, "At the very time, he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit and said,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   'I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   and have revealed them to infants.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   Yes, Father, for this way was pleasing in your sight.'"
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   It pleased him. It brought him joy.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   What brought him joy?
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   To hide these truths of salvation to the wise and the intelligent.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.600]   And he revealed it to infants.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   So the natural question is why?
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Why does this bring him joy, and why does he do it this way?
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   Well, he tells us, 1 Corinthians 1, 27-29.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   Why does he hide these things to the wise and intelligent,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   and why does he give it to infants?
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   He says, "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise,
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   deliberately shame the wise.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   And God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things that are strong,
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   that the world thinks that is strong.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   And the base things of the world, and the despised God has chosen,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.600]   the things that are not," and listen to this,
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   and he explains why he's doing this,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   "so that he may nullify the things that are,
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   so that no man may boast before God."
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   He said everything that he has done, the reason why he brings in pleasure,
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.600]   the reason why he brings salvation this way
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   is to nullify this world.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Because the main rebellion of mankind is to elevate himself,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   to be somebody.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   We work harder, we get our degrees,
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   we save up money, buy a bigger house, move to a better neighborhood,
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   we raise our children so that we can be better,
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   so that we can be better than our neighbors,
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.600]   smarter than our neighbors, wiser than our neighbors.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   And it is at the core of human rebellion to elevate himself.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   So Christ comes, emptied himself.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   If anybody had a right to come before mankind and said, "Worship me,"
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   he said in every way he was equal to God,
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   but did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   but he emptied himself and became a man, a servant.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   He comes in humble, he lives humble,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   and he leaves this earth humiliated,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   and then he tells his followers, "You do the same."
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   If you want to live, if you want to live, deny yourself,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   and you pick up your cross, and you follow me.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   He didn't say, "You know what, I've given you these things,
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   and make something of yourself." That's not what he said.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   "I've given you these talents, make something of yourself."
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   That's not what he said.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.600]   If you want to find life, do what Jesus did.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   Deny yourself and follow him, because at the core of human rebellion
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   is our pride.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.600]   In fact, Ephesians 2, 8 through 9, it says,
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves."
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   This is a passage that we know very well.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.600]   If you grew up in the church, we sang this in Sunday school.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.600]   "It is not of yourself, it is a gift of God, not as a result of works,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   so that no one may boast."
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   He's so concerned.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.600]   He's so concerned that even after we are saved,
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.600]   that we're going to cling to our pride,
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   that somehow we had some part in this.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   He says, "No," he said, "the reason why he saved you this way
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   is to nullify the things that you are pursuing.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   You had nothing to do with this, so stay humble,
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   so that you may not be proud," he says.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   Because he knows at the core of the rat race that you and I are in
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   is our constant comparing.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   It's our constant competing.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   And it's our constant collecting because of our pride.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   Remember the confession that Peter makes?
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   Who do men say that I am?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.600]   Some say, "You are Elijah." Some say, "You are John the Baptist."
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.600]   Some say, "You're one of the prophets."
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   And he says, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.600]   And Peter makes the right confession and says,
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.600]   And in response to that confession, he says,
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   "Upon this rock I will build my church."
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   Before he says that, this is what he says.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.600]   "Jesus said to him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Barjona,
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you,
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   but my Father who is in heaven.'"
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.600]   Now why does he say that?
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   Same reason, Ephesians 2.8 and 9.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   "So that no one may boast."
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   Peter, you didn't make this confession because you're better
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   than these other people.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   You don't know me because somehow you're more moral and righteous
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   and more disciplined and wiser than the others.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.600]   You were given this to you.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   Remember that.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   I was gracious to you.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   I chose you because you are an infant.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   I bypassed these spiritual elites.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   And the reason why they don't get it and the reason why you get it
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   is not because you are more righteous than them.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   It's because the Father has chosen to nullify the system of this world
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   and you are a child, an infant.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   You had nothing to offer me, and I revealed this to you
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   so that you would not be proud.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   "Flesh and blood did not give this to you.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   My Father gave this to you as a gift."
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.600]   Even as he's talking to Apostle Paul,
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   the apostle that was going to bring the gospel to the Gentile world,
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   he deliberately makes it hard for him.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   Puts a thorn on his side.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   He said, "Lord, take this away."
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   It was so agonizing.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   And he says, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   He said, "I'm going to leave it there to humble you
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   so that all the revelation that's coming through you,
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   that you do not think that it's because of you."
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   Because as soon as pride gets in, you are ruined.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   You are ruined.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   In Matthew 21:16, Jesus says,
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   "Do you hear what these children are saying?"
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   And Jesus said to them,
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   "Yes, have you never read out of the mouth of infants,
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   nursing babies you have prepared, praised for yourself?"
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   In other words, it was prophesied.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   Have you read?
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.600]   I have already told you this is the way I'm going to work.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   That I'm going to raise up infants to glorify me.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   Not the wise, not the clever, not the most disciplined,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   not the most righteous.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   Infants who have nothing to give me,
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   and they're the ones that I'm going to ordain to praise my name.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   And he's referring to Psalm 82,
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   "For the mouth of infants and nursing babes,
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   you have established strength because of your adversaries."
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   And who's his adversary?
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.600]   The one who's trying to usurp his glory
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.600]   to make the enemy and revengeful cease.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.600]   In other words, you're chosen because you have nothing to offer me.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   I used you because you couldn't take any praise for yourself.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   What does this tell us about man's biggest problem?
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   What is the greatest hindrance to the work of God?
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   It is our own pride.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   Above all, it is our own pride.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   Whatever it is that you're good at, that's your Achilles heel.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   That's your Achilles heel because through that will come pride.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   And as soon as pride comes in, you're ruined.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   You're ruined.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   You're baking a cake and you find something dirty in there.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   The whole cake is ruined.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   You can't eat that.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   Whatever it is that you think you're good at,
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   and as soon as a little bit of pride comes and touches, you're ruined.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   If you're good with numbers, it's through that lens you judge everybody else.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.600]   If you're good at athletics, through that lens you judge everybody else.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   And so as soon as we begin to think like I got something to offer God,
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   if only God would give me a platform,
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   and all of a sudden you become nullified.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   That's why he's told us to empty ourselves.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   He didn't say become somebody, train and get ready.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   He says no, empty yourself.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   In a large house, there are articles of noble purposes and ignoble purposes.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   If you want to be used for noble purposes, he says empty yourself of ignoble things.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   When Paul says, "I buffet my body and make it my slave,
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   and after I have preached to others that I may be disqualified,"
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   what is he primarily buffeting himself of?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   The primary thing is his own pride.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   That somehow, somehow in his education, in his knowledge, in his great experience,
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.600]   he's got something to offer God, and he is nullified.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   In Proverbs 6, 16-19, it says, "There are six things which the Lord hates,
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   yes, seven which are an abomination to him."
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   And obviously, the authors use this as for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   So the first time you read this, "Is that six or is that seven?"
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   Because that's not the way we normally talk.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   The Bible uses this for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   This is something that you really need to pay attention.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   Six things, seven things that God detests, and guess what's on the top of that list?
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.600]   Haughty eyes.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   I've already mentioned to you multiple times, when you see lists in the Bible, it's very purposeful.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   It's not thinking about seven random things and just put it in order and you figure it out.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   It says, "When whatever is on the front, whatever is in the back, it's for one purpose."
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   So when he starts by seven things that he detests,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.600]   and the first thing that is on there is haughty eyes, is pride.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   It is his desire to elevate himself.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   It is his desire to be noticed, to be somebody that ruins everything else.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   Lying tongue.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   Hands that shed innocent blood.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   Heart that devises wicked plans.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   Feet that run rapidly to evil.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   A false witness who uttered lies.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   And one who spreads strife among brothers.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   And at the core of that is pride.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   At the core of that is pride.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   Why it bothers us so much when somebody speaks ill of us.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   Because we try so hard to work on our reputation and how people view us.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   And then when somebody pokes a hole at that, we can't stand it.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   And so as a result of that, we say, "Well, then you deserve this or you deserve that."
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   And all the strife that comes in to human history is because our pride is hurt.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   And this is the reason why he says in Mark 10:15, "Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   like a child will not enter it at all until we are first empty."
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   That's why he requires repentance.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:18.600]   Repentance means that all that I had, all that I was pursuing, all that made me happy,
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.600]   all that I have hoped for, I was going the wrong direction.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   I was seeking pleasure in the wrong place.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.600]   I was seeking life in the wrong place.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   These are things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   It's all artificial things that I've been pursuing because I have been alienated from the presence of God.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   So salvation is to restore that presence.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   And that's where Jesus comes in.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   Jesus is the mediator of this joy.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.600]   In Luke 10:22, he says, "All things have been handed over to me by my Father,
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son,
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal him."
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   Because of our sins, we could not go to him.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.600]   We could not go to him.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   So he came to us.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   You know, when people ask, especially if you're young, "What field should I get into for work?"
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   I know this is not Asian, right?
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   And some of you parents aren't going to like me after this, okay?
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   I tend to--consider going into a trade school.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   Consider going to a trade school because in the Asian culture, if you don't go to Ivy League,
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   if you don't go to a top school, something--we have failed as parents, you know?
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   Like, our job is to get them into the best schools possible.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   Right now, people are not going into trade schools.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   So you have electricians and plumbers, and, you know, I know it's a lot of hard work,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.600]   but you're running your own business, and you can pretty much make whatever you want to make,
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   and, you know, you have freedom.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   You're not bound to a 9-to-5 job.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   So if you think about the practical ramification of that, a trade school is a good option.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.600]   You can stone me later, you parents, right?
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.600]   But it's very practical.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   But of all the things that I suggest, electrician is like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:23.600]   You know, that's one of the fields that every four people retire, only one is coming in, they said.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   So basically, you're going to have a monopoly in the next 10, 20 years.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.600]   Electrician, electrical, I don't know.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   I can do plumbing. I can do construction. I can do everything else, but not electrical.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   And the reason why is because of fear, because of fear.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   Because we don't know, like, what if it pops, and I don't know what if I cut the wrong thing.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   And so out of fear, right?
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   And that's a healthy fear, because you understand the power of electricity.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   People have less fear of God than electricity.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   They think about, they're going to just walk toward, you know, the presence of God.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   No, the whole purpose of the Old Testament is to teach us that we've been separated from God,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:14.600]   just how sinful this sin is, this rebellion, this desire to be somebody, to be recognized,
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   to be the center of attention, to be worshiped.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:23.600]   And the damage that that has done, that death has rained on mankind.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   And he said he gave the law in the Old Testament, the prophets, all to remind us the necessity of Christ.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   So that when Christ came, that they would recognize a need for a Savior.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   And that's why Jesus comes.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   He says, John 17, 25, 26, "O righteous Father, although the world has not known you, yet I have known you,
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   and these have known that you sent me, and I have made your name known to them,
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   and will make it known, so that the love with which you love me may be in them, and I in them."
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   So the whole reason why he came is to bring us to God.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   Bring us to God.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   A lot of people think their salvation is simply that they've got to get out of jail cart from hell.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   I don't know if you've ever watched the movie Shawshank Redemption.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.600]   And in that movie, basically, you have people who lived their whole life in prison,
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   and then you have this older man, I forgot his name, and he gets released.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   And he just doesn't know how to live.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   Because all he knew was prison life.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   When the doors were open, he came back, and he didn't want to go.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   Because there was no other life waiting for him outside.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   He only knew one life.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   And a lot of people who confess to know Christ experience Christ in the same way.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   We've been delivered from judgment, but they have no understanding to what we have been delivered for.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   The Bible says that we have been delivered from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of his beloved Son.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   New life in Christ.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   If there is no new life in Christ outside of prison,
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   all that has happened was the prison that you're in, the doors have become wider.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   The rooms have become bigger. The courtyard has become larger.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   That's all that has happened.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   But the reason why Christ came is to restore us back to God.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   It is in his presence we find life. In his presence we find pleasure.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   It is in his presence we find joy.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   That's why Jesus says, "I have come to give life."
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   Give life. Give joy. Abundantly.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   The natural question is, why does he do this?
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   In fact, Hebrews chapter 12 says, "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfect of our faith,
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   despite the shame, has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:06.600]   He said the reason why he endured the cross, despite the shame, was he was pursuing joy.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.600]   Isn't that crazy?
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.600]   He picked up the cross. He lived in humiliation.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   He was crucified on the cross.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   And he endured all of that, he says, to pursue joy.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   I remember the first time I was doing quiet time through this years ago,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   and I just couldn't get over it.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   For the joy he set before him.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.600]   He did all that for joy.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   What is the joy?
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.600]   That he was willing to be crucified.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   To be despised by his father.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   To be separated.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.600]   The only thing I can think of is me and you.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   Me and you.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   For the joy set before him.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.600]   It brought him pleasure.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.600]   To sacrifice.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   To see our salvation.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.600]   And so the natural question is, why does this bring joy to him?
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   Why does this bring joy to him?
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.600]   Well, there's anything that you've worked on, and the more you've worked on it,
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   and then you see the fruit.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.600]   It brings greater pleasure.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   So if you pray for anything, maybe for a week and God answers prayer, joy.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   If you pray for something for decades and God answers it, exponential joy.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   In anything that we do.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   Whatever you're building.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   Maybe you've been working in a med school and you had to go to school for, what, 50 years?
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   To finally graduate?
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   Joy.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:50.600]   The Bible tells us from the moment Adam and Eve fell, he said,
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   The serpent is going to come and bruise the heel of the seed.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   And then from Genesis chapter 3, he's been following his promise.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   And that's why he has genealogy after genealogy.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   It's not random.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   Because he's keeping a record of his promise.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   And he comes and he keeps a record.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.600]   And again, if you don't understand the context, you don't understand why these genealogies are there.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   But this is a record of his faithfulness.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   That's why when the New Testament started, it starts out with Jesus' genealogy.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.600]   To connect Jesus with his promise.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.600]   So for thousands of years, he's been laboring.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   Establishing the nation of Israel.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   Sending the prophets.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   Giving the law.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   Enduring.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   Despite all their failures.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   All so that Christ's sacrifice would open the door to restore us back to God.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   So we understand why he would be rejoicing.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   Because he says, "At the fullness of time."
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   All that he has done.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   All that he has endured.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   All that he had prepared was coming to fruition in Christ on the cross.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   But the real question goes deeper than that.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   We understand that he labored.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   But why did he choose to labor to begin with?
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Why did he choose to do that?
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   Why did he choose to save us?
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.600]   And why does this bring him so much joy?
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.600]   The answer is given to us.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   We know what the answer is, but it remains a mystery.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   He says, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son."
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   He did it because he loved us.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   That's why the gospel is a mystery.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   We don't understand.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.600]   But why?
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   Why would he love us?
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   And the psalmist asked the question, "What is man that you are so mindful of him?"
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.600]   God demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, he died for us.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   Why?
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   Why does he love us?
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   In a fallen world, it's like, "I don't understand hell."
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   Hell makes sense.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   If you blaspheme an almighty God, what do you think is going to happen?
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.600]   What do you think is going to happen?
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:30.600]   A God who can flip a switch and judge you for every wrongful thought and rebellion against him
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.600]   and blaspheming his name.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   And then he says, "You're going to be punished."
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   You don't understand that?
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   You don't understand hell?
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   No, hell makes sense.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   That a rebellious people rebelled and cursed his name.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   That God brings judgment.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   What doesn't make sense is why would he love us?
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   That's the mystery of the cross.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   It says in Isaiah 26.5, "For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.600]   And as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you."
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600]   Your God will rejoice over you.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Isn't that mind-blowing?
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   That our God rejoices over me and you?
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   He's not just putting up with us.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   He said it brings him joy.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   He says, "Because of the joy set before him, he endured the cross."
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.600]   He rejoices over us because he loves us.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:35.600]   And then Luke 10.23-24, "The blessed are the eyes which see the things which you see.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   For I say to you that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, because
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600]   they understood."
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   What is this?
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:48.600]   "Behold, what manner of love is this that He would allow us to call Him our Abba Father,
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   that we are the children of God, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   hear, and did not hear them."
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   It is this mystery of His love which produces worship.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   It's what produces worship.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600]   Why?
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.600]   Why would you love me?
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   Why would this bring joy to you?
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   Romans 8.35, "Who was separated from the love of Christ?
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   Would tribulation, distress, persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sore?"
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   Romans 8.38-39, "For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   nor things present, things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.600]   thing will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:45.600]   The growing understanding of what it is that we have in Christ is what causes us to be
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:52.600]   worshipers, not just doers, not just doers.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   Just discipline yourself.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600]   No.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   To worship.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   God is looking for people to worship Him in spirit and in truth, and He says it brings
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   Him joy.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   And the only answer, you can ask all the questions, all the things that don't make any sense,
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   and every one of your questions will lead to that question, "Why does He love us?"
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.280]   Why?
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:29.000]   As you guys know, some of you guys know, my oldest son got married last year, right?
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.600]   And I've been at, you know, many, many weddings, right?
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.560]   I don't know, it's got to be several hundred.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.520]   At the end of the wedding, not everybody, at the end of the wedding, there's some dancing
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.560]   going on, right?
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.400]   And usually that's my cue to leave, my cue to leave.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:54.360]   So as soon as the music gets, starts going, and the light starts flashing, and then people
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:01.200]   start wiggling, like, I'm out of there, and all the older people leave, right?
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.880]   In the beginning, it used to bother me because, you know, I come from a generation where,
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.240]   you know, the dancing is clubbing, and drinking, and debauchery.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.840]   And that's what I, in fact, when I first came to Biola, I actually had to sign a paper saying
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   I will not dance, because it wasn't allowed, right?
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.280]   So in the beginning, I was like, "What is this?"
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.440]   You know, they're dancing, it's just like, okay.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.720]   But years ago, I went to a synagogue, you know, it was required from our seminary class,
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.280]   just so you can have an idea of what the synagogue worship was like.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:37.640]   And at the synagogue, the rabbi would come, and he would read some passages, and I would
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:43.160]   say 70% of their worship is singing, they would sing the psalms, and then he would give
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.960]   a short exposition, right?
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.720]   And then, before the service is over, he gets everybody to stand up, and we would just go
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.280]   to the back of the sanctuary, and they would stand in a circle, and they have fellowship
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:00.800]   refreshments on the side, and they would just start dancing, and it was so weird, right?
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.360]   There's the lights, you know, and we started dancing, and I realized that that was part
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.920]   of their worship, of celebration.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.580]   Like King David, he entered the courts with singing and dancing, it says, and they were
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.360]   literally applying that.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.600]   And so, I started to say, "Okay, it's a little bit more," it was because of my cultural,
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.480]   you know, what I was taught, and I said, "Okay, so there's a celebration going on, as long
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.640]   as you don't dance a weird way, you know what I mean?
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.040]   And that you are selective of the music, you know, that, okay, I can see this as a celebration."
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.120]   But either way, it's not for me.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.720]   Either way, it's not for me.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:46.480]   So usually, when they're like, everybody knows, when the lights are down, PPK is gone, right?
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480]   That's known, right?
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:50.360]   But obviously, this is my son's wedding.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.040]   So I was there, I'm trying to stick around, 'cause I'm trying to help clean up, and then,
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:01.520]   you know, the music comes on, and I found myself so happy.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.960]   Not because of the music, you're right, not because of the DJ, because my son and his
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.560]   new bride was so happy.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.080]   And I was just watching, you know, taking a video of that, and he's like, "They're so
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.020]   happy today," you know?
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.840]   And they were dancing, and, you know, some of you guys said that I was dancing, I don't
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.680]   remember that part.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:33.360]   But I videotaped that, and I have it on my phone, and I watch it from time to time, because
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.040]   they were so happy.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.340]   They were so happy.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:45.080]   And I remember just sitting there until the music stopped, just soaking it all up, because
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.320]   my son has a new bride, and he's so happy, and you could see the joy on his face, you
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.560]   could see the joy, you know, on his bride's face, on the bride's, and the friends coming
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.800]   in, and then, just jumping up and down, and, you know, just sitting there, just so happy
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.760]   that day, seeing them so happy.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.080]   Our God rejoices over us.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.360]   That's why He says, "Rejoice always."
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.160]   And I say again, "Rejoice," because that's what He came to bring.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:24.040]   A new life, an abundant life, an eternal life in Christ.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:33.800]   So it brings Him pleasure to see us enjoying our new life, celebrating who He is.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:42.080]   It brings Him pleasure to see us worshiping Him, and rejoicing, and even dancing, because
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:49.400]   He loves us, because He loves us.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.440]   Who wouldn't want to worship this God?
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.640]   Who wouldn't want to worship this God?
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.600]   You know, people always ask me, like, "Isn't it hard, on Sunday, preaching three times?"
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.960]   Sunday's my favorite day, yeah, my favorite day, because, you know, all week, you know,
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.520]   I'm reading the Bible, and studying, and praying by myself, and then, I get to come and do
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.640]   it with everybody that I love.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.600]   You know, you can play basketball by yourself, but BBA is much more fun, because you get
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.400]   to do it with other people, right?
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.600]   That's why we have corporate prayer.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.480]   You can pray by yourself, but it's much better when you're praying with other people.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.600]   And that's what corporate worship is.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.960]   I get to do it three times, and it brings our Lord pleasure.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   It's mind-blowing.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:52.280]   I pray that this mystery of Christ, that you would soak in, that you would soak in, so
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:58.200]   that you and I would be the aroma of Christ wherever we go.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:10.880]   Father, we love you.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.760]   We love because you first loved us.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.040]   Help us, Lord God, to understand deeply what it is that we have in Christ, that all that
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.800]   we do would simply be a response, a reasonable response.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.120]   Help us, Lord God, to take our eyes off of ourselves, off of this world, and fix it on
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.720]   Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:58.440]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:25.440]   I will trust my Savior Jesus when my darkest hours befall.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:53.160]   I will trust my Savior Jesus, trust Him when my strength is small.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:03.160]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:14.760]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever Yours.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:40.120]   I will trust my Savior Jesus, He has said His way is best, and I know the path He's
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:45.520]   chosen for me.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:16:06.520]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:35.080]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:54.520]   Oh, on that cross, how it was seen, I can go now ever trusting in the One who died
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:16.960]   for me.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:45.400]   What could I bring for Your gift is complete.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:18:13.880]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:36.120]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.120]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever Yours.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120]   Let's pray.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.520]   1 Peter 1 3-6 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.120]   His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:59.520]   of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.200]   and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, for protected by the power of God
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.700]   through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:14.400]   In this, you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.800]   have been distressed by various trials.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:24.300]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize what it is that we have in Christ, that we would worship
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:33.560]   You in spirit and in truth, that we would declare Your new life, Your glory, wherever
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.360]   You send us this week.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.360]   Amen.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:20:02.860]   God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, He came to love, He left the world, He lived
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:31.500]   in us, He came to buy my soul, He came to buy my heart.
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:58.100]   And I know, because of You, all fear is gone, because I know, He owns the future, and life
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.860]   is the living, just because He lives.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:11.420]   Amen.
