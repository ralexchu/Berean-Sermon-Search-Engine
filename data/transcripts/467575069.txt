[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Alright, if you can turn your Bible to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:22.840]   Alright, we're going to be just focused on one verse this week, but I want to read it
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.240]   in context in verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.000]   As you guys know, as I mentioned last week, chapter 11 is kind of a transition from the
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.280]   foundations of faith in theology to practice.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:44.320]   And so chapter 11 is, again, giving forth the evidence of how right view of God is what
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.640]   causes people to live by faith.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.400]   And then we are moving to chapter 12 where it challenges us to practice these things.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.320]   So chapter 11 is where we're transitioning into that.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.880]   And then these are the beginning verses of it.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.000]   Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.520]   For by it the men of old gained approval.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.160]   By faith we understand that the words were prepared by the word of God so that what is
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.560]   seen was not made out of things which are visible.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   Let's pray.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.900]   Lord, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.360]   May your word have its effect on our hearts.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.860]   I pray that you would soften it, open our eyes, open our ears, that we may understand
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.160]   and hear you and you alone.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.640]   So we ask for your grace through your word.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.760]   Amen.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.000]   In the previous passage in chapter 10, one of the statements that led us to chapter 11
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.520]   is that the righteous will live by faith.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.280]   So this is a question that we ought to be asking every once in a while, or maybe even
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   weekly.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.600]   How much of what you pursued this week was by faith?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.760]   How much does your faith determine what you value, what you buy, where you go, what you
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   do?
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   And how much of it is simply based on I like this, I want this, I want to go here, I want
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   to do that.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.480]   How much of our lives are being directed by faith and how much of it is directed by our
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   desires?
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.160]   If we're not careful, we can live our lives just kind of going with the flow and every
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.480]   once in a while interjecting because we hear a sermon or we hear a Bible study or maybe
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680]   something that we're doing that reminds us, yes, I am a Christian so I should be doing
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.600]   this or I should not be doing this.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.920]   But how much of our lives are intentional?
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   The major that you choose, the field that you're going into, does that have anything
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.120]   to do with your faith?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.880]   The person that you choose to date and marry, does that have anything to do with your faith?
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.120]   The career path, where you live, where you go, decisions that you make, what does that
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.520]   have to do with faith?
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.680]   The life of a Christian described in chapter 11 is that everything is done by faith.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   Not simply the big picture, I made a decision to follow Christ, I'm going to go to church,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.920]   but everything else that we live by sight but not by faith.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.200]   It's important for us that we live according to what we believe, that all things that we
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.320]   do, that that should be the primary question that we ask.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.960]   Is this something that I do because I believe or is this something that I do just because
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   I desire?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.520]   Well, again, chapter 11 is a list of heroes in the faith in the Old Testament who lays
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.160]   a foundation for us and tangibly shows us that this is what it means and this is what
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   it looks like to walk by faith.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.280]   Remember last week we looked at the first two verses and he said, "Faith is," remember,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.360]   "the substance of things hoped for and it is the evidence of things not seen."
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.720]   And so the first point that we made last week was faith is what?
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   Tangible.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.840]   It's not just something we feel, you can actually observe faith.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.940]   You can see faith being played out and that's what chapter 11 is about.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.920]   These are people who believe and because of their faith, this is what their life looked
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.280]   like.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.100]   The second point of last week was what faith is not.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.120]   Faith is not faith in faith.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.580]   Just because you have faith doesn't give you power over anything.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.840]   So we know what faith is.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   It's tangible.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.920]   We know what faith is not.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.400]   And then the last part of it was faith is powerful.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.320]   That even if we have a faith of a mustard seed, as small as a mustard seed, that connects
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.400]   us to the Holy God.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.280]   And it is that tiny connection, no matter how small it is, that causes God to act and
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.040]   it is His power that causes us to be able to move mountains.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.680]   So the third point was that faith is powerful.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.560]   So the whole chapter 11 is a presentation of the power of God through faith, how it
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680]   was played out in the lives of these believers.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.780]   And then chapter 12 we're going to go to, therefore, this is how we ought to live.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.320]   So to give you a broad picture of what's happening in chapter 11, let me give you the summary
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.640]   of what he's going to say before we get into it.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.880]   I'm going to get more into it in a few weeks, but let me just give you the conclusion of
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.200]   what he's trying to say in chapter 11.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.640]   Chapter 11, verse 33 to 30.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.440]   By faith they conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises,
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.800]   shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.280]   weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight, women received
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.840]   back their dead by the resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting their release,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.320]   so that they may obtain a better resurrection.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.640]   Now we may look up to that point and say, wow, that's powerful testimony of what God
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.780]   does through faith.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.400]   That they conquered their enemies, they escaped the edge of the sword, the weak people became
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   strong.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.120]   So when we look at that, we say, wow, that's what we need to do.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.480]   If I just had faith, I could accomplish anything that I desire.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.440]   But that's not his whole point.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.280]   If you look at the whole of the text in verse 36, and others experienced mockings and scourging.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.560]   Yes, also chains and imprisonment.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.400]   They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.280]   the sword, they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.480]   ill-treated, men of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts and mountains
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.200]   and caves and holes in the ground.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.040]   Now who would want to walk by faith if that's what living by faith looks like?
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.520]   You know, we typically think that if we're faithful to God, God will be faithful to us,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.600]   and we define what faithfulness is.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.640]   That if we started a business, it's going to do well.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.440]   If we're studying hard, we're going to get good grades.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.960]   You get in a relationship, all things are going to get fixed.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.920]   If you're unhealthy, God's going to make you healthy.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.840]   If you have financial issues, God's going to answer you, and your financial is going
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.940]   to be better.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.160]   So we typically think, if we're not careful, that if I have enough faith, whatever problems
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.560]   that I may have, that God's going to fix it by faith.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.600]   But remember why he's writing this letter.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.240]   He's writing this letter because that wasn't coming for these people.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:22.120]   That they waited months, possibly years, and time is going by, and the persecution isn't
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.920]   letting up.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.820]   They were initially started joyfully, allowing their enemies to take away their property,
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.700]   and they celebrated that they were persecuted in the name of God.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.140]   But now time has passed, and their problem is not getting fixed.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.860]   So some of them are starting to drift back into an easier way.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.340]   They weren't rejecting Christ.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.740]   They were just taking a part of their world, and taking part of Christianity, and kind
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.540]   of living in the middle.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.860]   So they're not going to be rejected by the church, nor are they going to be rejected
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.860]   by the world.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.320]   They're just kind of living in the middle.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.720]   And those are the people that he's writing this letter to.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.980]   So not only is he reminding them that there are people who did great things because of
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.660]   this faith, but he tells them that because of this faith, they suffered.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.820]   Some of them had to die because of this faith.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.940]   Think about Apostle Paul.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.500]   Here's a man who was on the top of the world, is wealthy, well-educated, already famous,
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.420]   has authority and power, and he gets knocked off of a horse.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:28.900]   And the rest of his life, until the day he dies, he's living on the streets, persecuted,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.180]   beaten.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.980]   His fellow countrymen, people who looked up to him, they're the ones who are mocking him.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.100]   They're the ones who are stoning him.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.960]   Not only does he do that, he's going to every single city, trying to get other people to
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   join him.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.820]   I mean, who would want to join Paul?
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.060]   Remember, you know, the text that we're studying in Thessalonians?
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.060]   I think it's the next text, this week's text.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.060]   Paul reminds them.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.220]   He said, from the get-go, he says, if you follow Christ, remember, persecution and suffering
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   is coming.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.100]   Now, who would want to follow Paul?
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.020]   Who would want to follow Jesus if he told them from the get-go?
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:13.300]   You know, our tendency, again, in a modern-day church, is to invite people with chocolate,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.420]   hoping that they'll eventually be able to eat broccoli.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:24.180]   You know, promise them a community, promise them purpose, promise them joy, and then at
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.500]   some point, we're going to sneak in the cross, and hopefully some of them will become genuine
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.740]   followers that way.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.740]   Paul says, from the get-go.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.340]   He said, I warned you, when I preached the gospel about the life in Jesus Christ, he
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.980]   warned them from the get-go that suffering and persecution was coming if you follow Christ.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.660]   I mean, if you were an evangelist, you know, if you were a salesman, I mean, the worst
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:53.500]   thing, if you buy this car, it's a piece of junk, bad gas mileage, you know what I mean?
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.980]   After two years, you're going to have to take it to the shop.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.700]   I'm like, who's going to buy this car?
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.540]   And yet, the Thessalonians became model citizens, model citizens in the kingdom, and their faith
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.580]   began to spread.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:12.300]   Why would they follow Jesus Christ, if that's what's waiting for them?
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.580]   It's because they saw, by faith, a greater kingdom, a greater trade for this temporary
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.060]   life, this eternal life that God promises.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:27.460]   See, only people who actually have faith will follow Christ biblically.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.300]   You can become a cultural Christian.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   You can come to church.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   You can become a leader, but you will never move beyond cultural Christianity, because
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.140]   when you follow Christ of the scriptures, there are times that he will allow you to
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.060]   experience blessing, and that blessing will lead to God's glory and spreading of the gospel.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.980]   But there are many times it will lead to much suffering, because God has ordained that your
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.100]   suffering is going to bring about the glory of God.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.780]   And the only reason why anybody would follow that Christ of the Bible is if he believes
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.420]   that there is life beyond the cross, beyond death.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.220]   And that's the point that he was trying to make.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.580]   He said, by faith.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:14.860]   The reason why Abraham left his comfort zone, even in the Old Testament, and he walked out
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.140]   into the desert, is simply because he believed.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.700]   So every single person that is mentioned in chapter 11 are people who believed.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.700]   It wasn't because they were more noble than anyone else.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.300]   It wasn't because they were harder workers.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.180]   It wasn't because they were more educated.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.700]   It's simply because they believed.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.940]   That's the point of chapter 11.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.140]   They believed by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:44.780]   In fact, there's almost no line, right, in the whole chapter 11.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:50.260]   Every single person that is introduced here starts with that phrase, by faith.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.100]   So clearly the point that he's trying to make is that if you do not have faith, you cannot
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.280]   follow Christ.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.420]   But if you do have faith, it is only by faith that you will be able to persevere.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:09.420]   So this morning, when we look at verse 3, he lays the foundation, before he gets into
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:15.820]   the actual people, he said, we showed you last week, verse 1 and 2, that faith is tangible
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.120]   and faith is powerful.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.340]   And before he gets to the people, he said, but faith, we understand that the world were
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.820]   prepared by the Word of God.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.020]   Now why does he begin with that?
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.820]   Why doesn't he just jump in with Abel, and why does he lay first and foremost about creation?
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.580]   Well, one, it's chronological, obviously.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.660]   He's being thorough.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.240]   He's going through all the things that are required by faith.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.580]   But before he even gets to the people, he taps into something that everybody universally
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.580]   already believed.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:49.100]   In other words, it's kind of like saying what I said last week about gravity, right?
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.220]   Like I didn't have to convince anybody in this room, it's like, gravity, you believe
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.220]   in gravity.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.220]   You don't believe in gravity?
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.220]   How can you not believe in gravity?
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:01.020]   I don't need to say that because I already know that we're all in unison, in agreement
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.100]   that there is gravity.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.900]   We can't see it, we can't explain it.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.080]   How do you know it's there?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.760]   Because we're stuck to the ground.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.260]   This is evidence that there's gravity.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.100]   So we all believe that.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:17.460]   So what the author is doing is establishing that everybody actually has faith.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.260]   And he says, we're actually standing on this foundation of faith.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:26.700]   And that's what he's doing by first establishing chronologically that you and I wouldn't be
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.700]   here.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.620]   We wouldn't be able to exist if we didn't believe, if we didn't have any faith.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.620]   In fact, R.C.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.140]   Sproul says this, "Until enlightenment, the most firmly established article of Christian
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.820]   faith in the secular world was that of creation.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.860]   It had been established not only by revelation, but also by reason, not only by religion,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.500]   but also by science."
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.500]   Okay?
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.680]   Now, let me tell you ahead of time.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   That's the first point.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.620]   Why does he, why did we have verse 11?
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.940]   Before we get into the other verses.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.100]   One, foundation of faith begins with creation.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:05.500]   The second point is that foundation of faith believes that God as creator.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.100]   Now first and second point really is a setup for the third point.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100]   Okay?
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.820]   So I'm just giving you the heads up on that.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   Right?
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:22.080]   It seems fundamental and elementary that first two points, that if you actually believe that,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.520]   it'll establish the third and most important point, which is going to get us to the other
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.400]   parts of the text in chapter 11.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   Okay?
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.880]   So the second point, why does we have verse three?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.520]   Because foundation of faith believes that God is creator.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:44.380]   Before we believe that God is our savior, our initial contact with God is as our creator.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.820]   So that's why in Genesis chapter one, how does it start?
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.180]   Genesis chapter one, verse one, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.540]   So God is introduced to us from the very beginning of the Bible as the creator.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.580]   We come to the New Testament and Jesus is introduced to us.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.500]   Now we know we have Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.580]   John is the last of the four gospels.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:11.460]   Which of the four gospels introduces us to Jesus as God?
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.700]   John.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.260]   Right?
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.260]   John does.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.000]   So John is the one who introduces Jesus in his identity from the get-go.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And this is what it says.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.860]   John chapter one, verses one through three, "In the beginning was the word and the word
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.000]   was with God and the word was God.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.180]   He was in the beginning with God and all things came into being through him.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.140]   And apart from him, nothing came into being that has come into being."
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.060]   So not only is God introduced to us as the creator, Jesus is introduced to us as the
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.540]   creator.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:50.500]   So the first relationship, first identity between us and God is God the creator and
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.300]   the creation.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.740]   That's the foundational base in which the redemptive history is built.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.660]   If you reject that, everything else that you build on top of that is going to crumble.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.740]   And let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:12.180]   The fundamental sin of mankind is rejecting God as creator.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:19.020]   The fundamental, the initial, original sin of mankind is rejecting God as his creator.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.340]   There's only two types of people in the world.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:29.740]   Those who believe that God is our creator or those who believe that mankind ultimately
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.060]   is the answer.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.220]   Either you worship God or you worship man.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.580]   And it's divided into two parts.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:45.420]   In Psalm 14, verse one, it says, "The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:53.820]   If there's anything that we can prove, if there's anything that we observe the universe
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:02.220]   and by logic and by science that it points to a creator, it's this.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.740]   I mean it's kind of like looking at a child, you know, walk into a room and he's got chocolate
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.220]   all over his mouth, in his teeth, in his breath, all over him and you walk in and say, "Who
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.220]   ate the chocolate?"
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.220]   He said, "Nobody."
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220]   Right?
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.220]   Like, "Nobody?"
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.220]   "No."
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.220]   It's on your teeth.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:25.020]   It's in your mouth and clearly you ate it and then all the evidence points to the fact
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.020]   that you ate it.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.140]   But he said, "No, it didn't happen."
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:35.140]   The Bible says that God has left his imprint of who he is on all of creation.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.340]   In Romans chapter one, 18 to 20, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.100]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.380]   So he begins by saying the only reason why people do not see God is because they deliberately
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.460]   choose to repress God's imprint on creation.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:59.100]   Verse 19, "Because that which is known about God is evident within them."
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.940]   God left not only his imprint on creation, he says, because we're part of that creation,
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.940]   God left it in us.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.980]   You know, a lot of times people describe it as there's something, there's a hole missing,
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.180]   there's emptiness, what's the purpose?
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.740]   He says, "God left his imprint."
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:20.780]   So if you deny God, automatically there's some emptiness.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.340]   Because God created us for the purpose of his glory, so the moment that we separate
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.700]   from him, we're lost.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.420]   He said that he left his imprint not only on creation, creation of the physical world,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.700]   but in us.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.900]   He says, continuing on, he says, "For since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.060]   has eternal power, and his divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.300]   what has been made, so that they are without excuse."
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:55.860]   You know, if you've ever been evangelizing, and try to talk to just, you know, different
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:02.700]   people, I have found, this is just my personal experience, I have found that atheists are
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.820]   the easiest people to talk to.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.020]   They're the easiest people to talk to.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:14.340]   You know, and the reason why is because it's not that hard to explain that there must have
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.900]   been a creator, there must have been a designer, there had to be in the beginning.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.500]   Because no matter how intelligent they are, no matter how much they studied science, they
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.900]   don't know.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.660]   And they will never know.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.900]   They study, they dig, they get a PhD, they get multiple PhDs, and at the end, where is
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   the beginning?
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.180]   Nobody knows.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:40.140]   So the difference between a believer in God as a creator, and an atheist, an atheist basically
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.980]   says, "Well one day we will know.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   If we keep studying."
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.180]   I don't know if he will, but I think science will eventually uncover the truth.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.460]   So you have to believe that.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:56.260]   Either you believe man, and his achievements, eventually is going to answer all the questions
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:03.860]   that you have, or your observation will lead you to say, "There had to have been a beginning."
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.460]   He was intelligent.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:13.500]   The Bible says that mankind chooses to, willfully, reject God as their creator.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.660]   And so they have to suppress this truth.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.060]   You know, it's not too hard to explain, even to a young child.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.420]   Every one of my kids, when they went to school, they learned evolution, and they learned what
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.740]   was contrary to our faith.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.820]   And when we have to explain, when I have to explain about, well, does it make sense or
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.700]   not make sense, because they have teachers who are telling them that you have to be a
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.820]   dummy to believe that God exists.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.460]   Because what's being taught is, that you came from a mamiba, and enough time went by, we
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.860]   became banana eaters, and then eventually the hair fell off, eventually we became intelligent,
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.060]   and we built, you know, the airplane.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.100]   That's what's being taught.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.820]   So you know, I forget how old they were, but at one point I had this conversation with
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.980]   all of the kids, you know, using different illustrations, but let's say if you woke
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.100]   up one day and you saw a big dent on the side of your car, and right in the middle of it
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.660]   you see a footprint.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.100]   What's the first question you're going to ask?
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.160]   Whose footprint is that?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   Who did this?
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.300]   What if they came by and they said, "Well, that's nobody's footprint.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   It just happened."
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.300]   How could that be?
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.500]   I see a footprint there.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:27.260]   Well, I mean, there's a wind blew really hard, you know, and it blew so hard that that shoe
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.060]   came out of nowhere and it hit it so hard and left a footprint, right?
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.580]   I've never seen that happen before.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.580]   Is that even possible?
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.900]   It's like, well, that's the only answer we have.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.020]   Nobody would accept that.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.060]   And we're talking about a simple dent on a car.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.580]   A simple dent on a car with a shoe print, you will not accept that because somebody
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.920]   obviously did that.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.480]   You compare that, a dent on the car versus what you see in the universe, the amount of
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.740]   oxygen that you and I need just to get up and survive, the temperature that we need.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.140]   If it goes a little bit higher, we burn to death.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.420]   If it goes a little bit lower, we freeze to death.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.940]   If the earth rotates a little bit faster, we'll die.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.260]   If the gravity is too heavy, we'll die.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.980]   I mean, think about the distance between the sun.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.820]   If we get too close, we'll burn to death.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.540]   If we get a little bit too far, we'll freeze to death.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.700]   Think about all the complexities of the universe that needs to be in place and at work all
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.180]   the time, 24/7, just so that you and I can wake up in the morning.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:35.500]   And I'm just talking about, with my limited knowledge, just a speck of how this universe
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   works.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.380]   Some of you guys are science majors, so you know better than that.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.180]   And you compare just the eyeball, right?
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.600]   I know we have eye doctors, and all they do is spend 10 years studying the eyeball.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.620]   And they're amazed about how the eyeball, this is just the eyeball.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.040]   We're talking about a dent in the car.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.900]   You won't accept that that just happened.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.820]   You cannot accept that because that defies logic.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.500]   And yet, the world tells us this is how the universe works.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:12.220]   According to evolution, we go from chaos, right?
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.860]   To what?
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.220]   Chaos to order.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.680]   According to evolution.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.260]   But everything that we observe, we go from order to chaos.
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.420]   You have a brand new car, five years later, is it newer?
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.460]   No.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.340]   Something as simple as a car, a material, we know that the older it is, it's more delicate
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.900]   because it deteriorates.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.780]   So according to evolution, don't worry about wars, because it's going to figure itself
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   out.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.780]   Everybody's worried about climate change.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.940]   I mean, according to evolution, it should be fixed.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.940]   Give it enough time.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.980]   We're not going to be living in utopia.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.980]   Give it enough time.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.060]   The earth is going to be perfect.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.340]   Give it enough time.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.040]   Every problem is going to get fixed.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.860]   If you buy into that.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.100]   And that's why the Bible says a fool says in his heart only if he chooses to suppress
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.140]   all the evidence that we see.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:12.020]   That clearly points to a creator that you can live without God in your life.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:16.180]   Everything points to the fact that there is a creator.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.020]   There must be a creator or life does not make sense.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.240]   Your birth does not make sense.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.320]   Your life does not make sense.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.620]   Your death does not make sense.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.540]   In fact, yesterday I had an opportunity to try to share the gospel with this old man.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.280]   He was 90 years old.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.420]   He saw a very thick theology book that I had and he started asking me questions.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   What is that?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.300]   So I just assumed he was a Christian.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   So I said, Oh, are you a Christian?
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.820]   He said, No, no, no, I'm not a Christian.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.820]   I think he was just bored and he just wanted to make conversation.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.860]   So I said, Great, you know, I don't have to, I'm not pursuing.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.860]   He's talking to me.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.420]   So it's a great opportunity.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.980]   So I started asking him, so what do you believe in?
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.100]   He said, I'm an atheist.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.700]   So I asked him, Are you an atheist because you chose to be an atheist or are you an atheist
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.780]   because you were born in a certain family who influenced that way?
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.120]   And then he told me about how his dad hated religion.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.660]   You know, he grew up in Ireland and he came from a poor foreign family and he blamed all
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.020]   the problems in the world on religion.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.020]   So he grew up in that home.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.100]   So I asked him, so do you think, are you influenced by that or did you consciously make a choice
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.100]   to be an atheist?
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.020]   And he said, to be honest, and again, this is a 90 year old man.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.260]   He said, to be honest, yeah, I was heavily influenced by my upbringing.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.100]   And then, and then, you know, I, you know, okay, that's an entrance.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.940]   So how do I, how am I going to share the gospel with him?
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.880]   So I asked him why I'm not an atheist.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.580]   I told him why I'm not an atheist.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.940]   And I began to share with him that I can't believe that all this is by chance, that our
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.900]   death, you know, our birth, our death, that the, how the world works, ecology, our, our,
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.900]   our body.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:45.900]   And I said, how can we look at that?
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.980]   And I started, I gave him that illustration about the car dent, you know, and I said,
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.900]   I don't know how you can look at that and say, and then I could tell he's starting to
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.020]   shut down.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.400]   And he started to kind of pull back and say, you know, the great thing about America is
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.700]   we have freedom to believe or freedom not to believe.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.060]   And I said, that's great.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.060]   That's, that's right.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.420]   You know, that's why I love America is we live in a free country, right?
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   You have the freedom.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.300]   No one can make you believe, right?
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.900]   And no one can make me not believe.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.580]   But that's why we're able to have this conversation.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.580]   I can open dialogue so I can learn about you and you can learn about me.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.820]   And he was engaging me.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.540]   I wasn't asking him, he was asking me because he just, he was just a friendly man.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.900]   So I started asking him about that.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.540]   This is what I believe and this is why I believe it.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.580]   And as soon as I began to say that, he started shutting down.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.180]   He said, well, well, well, you know, like that's your opinion.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.500]   And I said, yeah, yeah, it's my opinion, but this is based upon what I observed.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.780]   And I asked him, what do you think is going to happen after you die?
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.100]   Do you think all this is it?
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.140]   That after you die, there's nothing, you came randomly, you live randomly, and then you
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.140]   die randomly.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.940]   And then he wouldn't answer that question.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.060]   He said, you know, the good thing about living in a free country is we can do whatever we
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060]   want.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.060]   That's what he kept on saying.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.060]   And so that's what I'm doing.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.860]   I'm doing whatever I want, right?
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.220]   So I mean, it was a friendly conversation, but I could tell that what I told him made
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.740]   him feel uncomfortable.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.740]   And it was just a dialogue.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.740]   We want to talk about it.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.100]   I think I could have talked about anything.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.100]   He would have been fine because he wanted to engage.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.420]   But the moment I told him why I believed in the Creator, he said he didn't want to hear
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   it anymore.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.420]   That was it.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.420]   It was a friendly conversation.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.900]   I wasn't pushing him.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.460]   He was coming to me.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.900]   And yet that was one conversation he did not want to have.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.500]   It is not difficult when you look at the imprints that God has left in the universe and even
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:41.060]   in our own lives of who He is.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.100]   When you suppress the truth like the world does, they clearly see things that they can't
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.740]   understand.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.460]   There is order in the universe that they don't understand.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.180]   Even by their own definition of the physics that they teach in the university doesn't
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.460]   fit what they believe.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:03.700]   Because everything is supposed to go from order to chaos and yet the overarching truth
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.180]   that they teach is it's going from chaos to order.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.280]   So by their own teaching it contradicts one another.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.720]   So whenever they can't explain anything, what do they call it?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.620]   Mother Nature.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.140]   Now this Mother Nature is powerful because we're here by Mother Nature.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:28.420]   Mother Nature is extremely powerful because the earth rotates at a perfect speed, at a
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.660]   perfect distance, all of this.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:38.040]   It is creative if you look at all the different things and any field that you go into.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.540]   You can just dive into that the rest of your life.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.500]   Any field.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:53.380]   All of creation points to the fact that there has to be a creator or it doesn't make sense.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.100]   It says in Romans 1 21-23, "For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.860]   or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.380]   was darkened, professing to be wise."
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.380]   Isn't that the world?
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.300]   Doesn't that perfectly describe the world?
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   That we're the wise.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.460]   If you're a Christian, you're foolish.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.220]   You're backward.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.220]   You don't know science.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.740]   They don't believe in science.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.580]   And more and more, we live in a government that if you happen to be a man or woman of
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.660]   faith, you're foolish, so you don't belong in the public arena.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:31.460]   "Proclaiming to be wise," it says, "they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.460]   God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and of four-footed animals
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.380]   and crawling creatures."
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.660]   There's only two groups of people.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:49.140]   Either we believe God as the Creator or we believe in man.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.340]   Either way, it requires faith.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.340]   Tremendous faith.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:58.940]   And all he is saying is, it requires much more faith, much more mental gymnastics, much
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:06.940]   more blind leaping to believe that there is no order, there is no power, there is no creativity
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.460]   behind what we see in creation.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.980]   Now having said all of that, I told you all of this is really to get us to the third point.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.540]   The third point is foundational faith believes that God is sovereign.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.660]   He's sovereign.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.540]   That's the point that he's really trying to make.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.020]   All of everything that he says is really only trying to lay the foundation to get to that
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.020]   point.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.820]   And this is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.620]   This is where the rubber meets the road that if you believe that God is sovereign, it'll
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.160]   affect every part of your life.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:47.820]   You notice here that he, in verse 3, it says, "By faith we understand that the worlds..."
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.820]   It's in plural.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820]   Why is that in plural?
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.160]   Why does it say the world?
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.620]   Why is it in plural world?
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.980]   Well, there's something happening in the Greek there.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.180]   The Bible usually has two different words for world.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.900]   The cosmos is the world that you and I normally think of as the earth, the creation, the physical
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.060]   world.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:13.160]   The word that is used here is "ion," which typically is translated "age" or "generation."
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.700]   But it's in plural.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.880]   So most of the commentators believe that the word "ion" in the plural form is referring
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.800]   to the totality of creation.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   All of it.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.320]   Not just the physical world, but even the spiritual world.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.780]   That's why often when the Bible describes God as a creator, he doesn't say he created
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.780]   the physical world.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.000]   This is what it says in Colossians 1 through 16.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.280]   "For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.560]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.000]   All things have been created through him and for him.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.640]   He is before all things, and in him all things hold together."
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.940]   In other words, he didn't just create the universe.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.120]   It wasn't just the Genesis chapter 1 he's referring to.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.920]   He's talking about the spiritual world.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.640]   He's talking about the authorities in the world, the kingdoms, both heaven, earth, and
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.960]   under the earth.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.020]   He created heaven and hell, everything that you and I know that exists.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.160]   God is the originator.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.400]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   Not only is he the originator of all creation, he said he created it out of nothing.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.080]   Ex nihilo.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.400]   Out of nothing.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.760]   You know, there's a lot of famous magicians, or they call themselves illusionists, because
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.400]   they are tricking us to see things that we don't see.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.920]   So I remember a long time ago, you know, I think it was David Copperfield who did a magic
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.760]   show on television, and he made a jet airplane disappear.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.240]   And I remember as, I think I was in high school when I saw that.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.920]   Wow, how did he do that?
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.400]   Years later, they said it was a camera trick.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.480]   You know, they basically took the camera and they just did this.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.640]   I was so amazed for years, you know.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.920]   And I know that, probably you guys know who David Blaine is.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.120]   I remember first time seeing street magic, and he was on the street and he levitated,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   right, from behind.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.160]   I said, wow, that guy's, you know, maybe he's possessed.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.960]   Later on they found out that one of his foot kind of tipped forward and he lifted his back.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.480]   It's like, oh, that was it?
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.720]   Every magic trick that we see is just an illusion.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.360]   They take something, a sleight of hand, mirror, or whatever that they're doing, that even
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:33.040]   when they make things appear, it's all to make it look like it came out of nothing.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.000]   Only one being can actually make something out of nothing.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.320]   That's God.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.680]   Where there was nothing, and by His Word, it appears.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.040]   Do you know why it's emphasized that, like, whenever God, the Bible talks about His creation,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.360]   He said it's by His Word.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   By His Word.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   By His Word.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.760]   Do you know why He says that?
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.120]   Because you and I, when we say something, I mean, we don't have that kind of authority.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   I didn't drive to LA.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.160]   I wish I had the authority to just open the window and say, "Be gone!"
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.440]   Right?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.080]   Or maybe that there's fire going on.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.600]   It's like, "Get out of here!"
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   Right?
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   It has no authority.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.360]   Who has that kind of authority to use the Word?
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.720]   And things happen.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   Only a king.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.160]   Because a king walks down and he says, "You know what?
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.880]   This street needs to be gone."
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.360]   And literally, that becomes law.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.480]   You know, from now on, you're going to worship this monument, and so that becomes law.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.720]   Only somebody with authority, when they speak, it happens.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:42.000]   So when it mentions over and over again that by His Word, that simply by His Word, it wasn't
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.480]   His hard work and years of planning.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.160]   He just said it and it happened.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:55.200]   So the fact that God as a Creator, who creates something out of nothing, simply by His Word,
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.160]   all of it is referring to His power that nobody else has.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.480]   It's talking about His authority.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.040]   Now think about that.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:11.720]   How that relates to this doctrine of sovereignty.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.600]   Think about all the problems that we get anxious about.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.480]   When His disciples needed money, He said, "You know what?
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   Let's go get a job.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.360]   We need to get a job."
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.280]   What did He tell His disciples?
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.520]   "Go get that fish.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.160]   Open its mouth."
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.840]   People didn't have enough food.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   What do we do?
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   They're anxious.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.320]   He said, "Well, just give it to them."
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   Give them what?
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.200]   And He fed 5,000 people, just out of nothing.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.920]   And this is the reason why when the disciples were on that boat and the storm came, they
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.000]   were afraid to die.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.440]   Jesus is sleeping and the disciples are getting upset that Jesus doesn't care and He wakes
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.440]   them up.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.160]   Remember what Jesus says?
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   He gets annoyed with them.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.200]   He says, "You of little faith."
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.640]   Isn't that weird?
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:11.880]   How many of you would be on that boat and just in perfect peace?
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.040]   We'd be doing the same.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.400]   Remember, these guys are lifelong fishermen.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.460]   They know the waters much better than Jesus.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.960]   Why did Jesus rebuke them?
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.000]   That seems unfair.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.880]   Because what human being would not have been scared?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.040]   What human being would not have been anxious?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.600]   The difference was Jesus was on the boat.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.320]   He was rebuking them because He said, "You do not know Me.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.680]   Do you think you will die if I don't want you to die?
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.760]   Do you think you will live if I wanted you to die?"
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.360]   And what He was rebuking was their lack of faith in who Jesus was.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.480]   It wasn't because they were scared of the boat.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.840]   It was because they didn't believe in Jesus.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.400]   And so that's where this doctrine of God as Creator, speaking out of His Word, ex nihilo,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:06.040]   out of nothing, all of that is to set up that do you believe in this sovereign God?
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.280]   That whatever is happening in your life, whatever is happening in our generation, that God has
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.960]   not lost control.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:18.620]   The things that we fear, that if we obey God, what if?
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.100]   What if I won't get this?
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.600]   What if I won't be there?
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.560]   What if I can't get this job?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.200]   What if I don't get healthy?
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.520]   What if things don't come into order?
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.920]   What if I do this?
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.320]   What do you believe in a sovereign God?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.360]   If He created the whole universe, everything that we know, simply by His Word, out of nothing,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.840]   couldn't He just create it if He wanted to?
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.480]   Couldn't He just say, "You need money?"
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.000]   Out of nothing, right?
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Couldn't He just do that?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.400]   You know, everybody's worried about this climate change and all this.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.920]   Couldn't He just say, "Gone?"
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.040]   Everybody's worried about the politics.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.040]   Boom, gone.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.760]   If He didn't want the authority to be there, you know, do you think He's trembling?
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.560]   He's like, "Oh, I hope these people pick the right person."
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.200]   You know, my redemptive history is going to be ruined if we have the wrong person in there.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.760]   You think God is shaking in His boots on His throne?
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.920]   No.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.360]   He is sovereign.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.960]   Absolutely sovereign.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   And that is why these men and women of faith were able to walk into darkness.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.640]   Because their light wasn't through their eyes.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.040]   It was God Himself.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.120]   That even if we suffer, I trust Him.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.560]   Whether we are delivered and blessed, whether we suffer, I trust Him.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.800]   Because He's the sovereign.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:51.680]   So that's the foundation that He is laying to tell us that this is the faith that they're
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680]   standing on.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:58.120]   Ephesians 1.10, "Also, we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:02.560]   to His purpose, who works all things after the counsel of His will."
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.360]   Again, in Romans 8.28, "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.920]   to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.080]   Do you know why non-Christians don't follow Christ?
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.400]   Because they simply don't believe Him.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.680]   It's up to us.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.040]   We have to make this right.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.720]   We have to make this world right.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:29.120]   So they suppress the truth and they continue to pursue their glory.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.760]   But the reason why Christians struggle is because we go back and forth, back and forth
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.920]   from believing this.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.880]   All things work together for good.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.840]   All things work together for good.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.320]   And so we get caught up in saying, "We need to get here."
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.120]   And so we need to work hard and make decisions and do things to get here.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.000]   And then when it looks like we're not going to get here, we get anxious, we fight, we
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.480]   struggle and we get into all kinds of problems because we're trying so hard to get here.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.800]   But God did not command us that.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.240]   He said to be faithful, "Do not turn from my word to the left or to the right.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.320]   Your success is going to depend on do you trust me?"
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.300]   You know, I've shared this so many times before, but that story of Jericho just, it's always
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:27.120]   mind-blowing that why would God switch out the commanding officer Moses with Joshua who
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.840]   has no experience, right before they get into this 40 years that they've been waiting to
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.780]   battle to get into the land of Canaan, and all of a sudden they got this young, inexperienced
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.140]   general to get in there, and the only instruction he gives them is, "Don't turn from my word
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.800]   to the left or to the right.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.040]   Don't turn from my word to the left or to the right."
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.080]   And then right before they go, the only instruction he gives them is, "Take this box and walk
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   around the city."
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.040]   He just does it.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   They were trained.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.600]   They're like soldiers in basic training.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.960]   If the commanding officer tells you to move, you move.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.440]   You sit down, you sit down.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.840]   If the cloud moves, you move.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.820]   If it sits down, you sit down.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.500]   And that's all they've been doing for 40 years, basic training marching, and all of a sudden
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:17.100]   this young officer, just in case that maybe Moses might take the credit, just in case
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.380]   the nation of Israel may look at Moses and say, "Oh, Moses.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.740]   Thank God we had Moses."
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.140]   He switches them out.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   And then so Joshua takes him and he said, "Walks around on the seventh day.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.580]   Now do this seventh time.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.500]   Today, today I'm going to give you this land."
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:39.280]   Seventh time, you're going to tire out the whole army of Israel before they get into
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:46.760]   a battle with a fortified city that has walls, who have been fighting in their history, trained
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:52.480]   men, and you got these guys walking around with their families and children with a box,
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:58.920]   with an untrained soldier up at the front, and then you're going to walk around seven
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   times.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.000]   He's going to blow the trumpet.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.660]   What are you doing?
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.080]   How will you be successful doing that?
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.860]   But you know what happened?
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:12.340]   They did exactly what God told them to do and they blew the trumpet, walls fell down,
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.460]   and they walked and literally just walked into the city.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:24.380]   Not by might nor by sight, but by my power, says the Lord, by my spirit.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:30.420]   That's the same lesson that we are taught over and over and over and over and over again,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.640]   all throughout history.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.860]   And every single person that's mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11 is an evidence of that
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:44.940]   truth by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith, not by might, not by might, but
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.940]   by his spirit.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.340]   Look at what's going on around us right now.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:43:01.300]   The pandemic, the racial tensions, the political turmoil, the economic struggles, the educational
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.100]   system, international relationships.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:10.660]   I mean, look at the turmoil that is around us, natural disasters.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:17.040]   I mean, it's enough to take even the most grounded person to be shaken.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.300]   But do we believe in this God?
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.100]   Do we believe in this God?
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:28.340]   Do we walk by faith or by sight?
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.700]   Let's pray.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:38.740]   Heavenly Father, we praise you for who you are.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:44.620]   Lord, in our weak faith, we cling to you.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:50.440]   Sometimes we struggle, Father God, to keep you at the forefront of our minds.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.180]   We thank you for our corporate gatherings.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:58.340]   We thank you for teaching us, reminding us, Lord God, how desperate we are when we are
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.720]   far from you.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.060]   I pray that for the next few weeks, as we wrestle with the examples that you've given
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:10.140]   us, the cloud of witnesses that you've set before us, that we will not simply study it
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:14.380]   as history, but as examples to follow.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.780]   And so we pray, Father God, that your grace will be sufficient, that we may walk and live
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.500]   lives truly worthy of the gospel that you've given us.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.720]   Amen.
