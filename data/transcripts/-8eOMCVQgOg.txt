[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   When do I know if God is correcting me?
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.040]   It's a question every believer faces eventually, and today it comes from a female listener
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.040]   named Hunter.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.540]   This is so good.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.540]   Listen to this.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.120]   Quote, "Pastor John, thank you for your honest answer about the pandemic this year.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.020]   I'm thinking especially of your special episode titled, 'How do we make sense of the coronavirus?'
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.600]   There you concluded that some instances of suffering, including weaknesses, illness,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   and death, represent direct judgments of God for our sin intended to discipline us and
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200]   to bring us to repentance and restoration.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.560]   I see this in passages like 1 Corinthians 11, verses 30-32.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.840]   Yet we also know from Scripture that God allows some suffering, not as a specific judgment
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.760]   or correction, but simply to display His glory and build in us patient endurance.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.920]   I see this in passages like John 9, 3 and 2 Corinthians 12, verses 8-9.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   Now my question is this, when God brings suffering into our lives, how can we discern if that
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.920]   suffering should be met with patience and endurance or with immediate life evaluation
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920]   and alteration?"
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   Good question.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.760]   So well thought through, so well articulated.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.800]   First, let me say that I very much agree with Hunter that those two ways of God's treating
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.840]   us are real.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.240]   They are in the Bible.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:39.760]   On the one hand, He may discern a specific pattern of sin in our lives to which He directly
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.920]   responds with some kind of trouble or suffering in our lives to wake us up and refine us and
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.280]   to heal us and to bring us to repentance because He loves us.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.560]   As it says in Hebrews 12, 6, "The Lord disciplines those whom He loves, the Son whom He loves,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.640]   and chastises every son whom He receives."
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.000]   I know that experience is very hard sometimes to believe because even though it's taught
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.040]   so plainly in the Bible, the thought that God's love for His children is bringing this
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.880]   pain is very difficult to feel with great affection.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.440]   We need all the encouragement we can get from the Scriptures to believe that He's our Father,
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.960]   He will never cast us away, and that afflictions are for our good.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:49.200]   On the other hand, as Hunter points out, texts like John 9, 3 intend to teach us not to assume
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.320]   that every affliction is directly a response to some particular sin in our life, but that
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   sometimes we are being given in our affliction an opportunity to magnify the grace of God
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.600]   through faith and patience and love.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.920]   So I agree with Hunter that those two divine ways of dealing with us are very real.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.380]   They're both taught in the Bible.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.680]   But what makes answering Hunter's question so difficult, the question namely, how to
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   know when we are being treated one way or the other, what makes it so difficult is that
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.960]   the line between them is permeable.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.720]   Another way to say it would be those two kinds of response from God to our situation always
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:55.880]   overlap, which means practically that there is never a situation in life where we should
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.200]   not respond with self-evaluation.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.440]   Yes, should we respond with evaluation or with patience?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.480]   And I'm saying there's always appropriate evaluation in the midst of affliction and,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.560]   if necessary, alteration.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.280]   In other words, I'm suggesting to Hunter that in the end, knowing for sure which of these
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.320]   two ways of being treated by God is happening to us is not essential to living as we ought.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.160]   God may make it plain.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.360]   He may.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   But he may not.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.600]   Now, let me illustrate what I'm talking about.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:45.140]   In James 1, verses 2 to 4, James says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet various
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:55.240]   kinds of trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.800]   And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.320]   in nothing."
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.880]   So here James pictures all of us Christians meeting various kinds of trouble, which he
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:19.560]   calls trials or tests, and he doesn't distinguish whether they are coming in response to specific
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.320]   sins we've committed or not.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:32.080]   What he says is that in every kind of trial—every kind—faith is being tested, and the aim
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   in every trial is a kind of steadfastness that shows that God is trustworthy and wise
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.720]   and good and valuable and all-sufficient for our situation.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:53.400]   Ultimately, the aim of every trial in the Christian life is to make Jesus look great
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.760]   by our patience, our faith, our love for others in his goodness.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:08.160]   Now some of those trials may be owing to specific sins in our lives, and others of those trials
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.600]   may not be, but the goal is the same in both.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:21.460]   If there are specific sins in our lives, the goal of Christ-exalting steadfastness includes
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.980]   recognizing and repenting of and moving out of those sins.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:34.680]   But if no specific sins are manifest, then the goal is still the same—magnify Christ
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   through faith and repentance and love.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.380]   So what I'm suggesting is that whether we can discern that a specific suffering is owing
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.680]   to a specific sin is not of the essence.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:01.820]   The essence is, let every trial have its sanctifying effect of killing sin and furthering faith
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.180]   and furthering patience and furthering love.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.260]   If the sin is known, kill it.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:17.180]   If it is unknown, ask the Lord to protect you, to cleanse you from hidden faults like
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.220]   the psalmist do, and to advance your capacities for faith and patience.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.500]   Now I don't think I'm making this up, this merging of these two.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.940]   I think Job is an illustration of what I'm trying to get across, namely that even the
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:42.460]   suffering that comes into our lives as an opportunity for the demonstration of God's
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:52.340]   worth through faith and patience nevertheless always has the secondary design to take our
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.140]   sanctification deeper.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:04.260]   So when Satan asked God for permission to hurt Job, the context was that Job was a blameless
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:11.460]   man, meaning that the sufferings which came to him were not disciplinary as a response
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.460]   to some sin that he was walking in.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:23.300]   It was God's way of giving Job the opportunity to show the value of God over his health,
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.580]   over his family, over his prosperity.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:37.020]   However, over time, the suffering of Job was such that it did stir up in Job the sediment
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:43.740]   of remaining sinfulness, which he later clearly repented of in chapter 42.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.460]   "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:56.780]   despise myself and repent in dust and ashes," Job 42.5.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.980]   This I think will prove true for all of us.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:07.740]   Whether the suffering in our lives is chastisement for some specific sin or whether the suffering
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:14.100]   is an opportunity to glorify God through faith and patience, in both cases we're going
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:22.620]   to discover remnants of sinfulness in our lives, which we should repent of and move
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.900]   beyond, which is why I said there's always room for self-evaluation.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.580]   So let me close with what may be the most important thing to say.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:42.300]   Whenever suffering comes into our lives as the elect, loved, justified, secure children
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:48.060]   of God, there are two kinds of temptations, not just one.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:55.340]   One is to neglect the suffering as an opportunity for proving our steadfastness of faith and
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:04.340]   patience, and the other is to fear that we are being condemned and not being treated
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.700]   as the children of God.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:14.580]   So I want to encourage Hunter and all of us to establish ourselves in the Word of God,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.740]   in the redeeming work of Christ, in the sealing work of the Holy Spirit, and in the walk of
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:30.900]   holiness, establish ourselves to grow in our confidence that we are God's children, and
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:41.020]   if children, then heirs for sure, knowing that we must suffer with him on the way to
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.060]   being glorified with him.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.420]   Very good and helpful and practical word for all of us to hear.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.420]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.940]   And a great question, Hunter.
