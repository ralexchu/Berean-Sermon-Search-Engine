[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   I first believed
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   My chains are gone
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I've been set free
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   My God, my Savior
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Has ransomed me
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And like a flood
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   His mercy reigns
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Unending love
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Amazing grace
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   The Lord has promised good to me
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   He will my hope secure
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   He will my shield and watch me
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   As long as life endures
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   My chains are gone
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I've been set free
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   My God, my Savior
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Has ransomed me
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And like a flood
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   His mercy reigns
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Unending love
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Amazing grace
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   My chains are gone
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I've been set free
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   My God, my Savior
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Has ransomed me
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And like a flood
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   His mercy reigns
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Unending love
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Amazing grace
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The sun forbear to shine
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   But God who called me here alone
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Will be forever mine
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Will be forever mine
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You are forever mine
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   [Piano interlude]
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Though the nations rage
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Kingdoms rise and fall
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   There is still one King
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Reigning over all
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So I will not fear
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   For this truth remains
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   None above Him, none before Him
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   All of time in His hands
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   For His throne it shall remain
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And ever stand
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   All the power, all the glory
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I will trust in His name
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   He is here with me
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I am not alone
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   For His love is sure
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And He knows my name
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   None above Him, none before Him
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   All of time in His hands
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   For His throne it shall remain
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And ever stand
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   All the power, all the glory
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I will trust in His name
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   [Piano interlude]
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Though I may not see
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   What the future brings
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I will walk
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   As we gather may your spirit work within us
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   As we gather may we glorify your name
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   We'll be blessed because we came
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   We'll be blessed because we came
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   As we gather
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   As we gather may your spirit work within us
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   As we gather may we glorify your name
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   We'll be blessed because we came
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   We'll be blessed because we came
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   His mercies never come to an end
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   We are new every morning, new every morning
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Great is Thy faithfulness, O Lord
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Great is Thy faithfulness
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Great is Thy faithfulness, O Lord
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Great is Thy faithfulness
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Let me get the fog out of here.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I got too excited in worship.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Again, those of you who are online as well.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I want to make a few announcements
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   before we get started on this.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   First of all, obviously, that you're probably aware
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   that the numbers and the COVID is rising
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and if you didn't read the instructions
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   that we gave on Facebook and the church page,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   if you haven't read that yet,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   we strongly encourage you to read that
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   because that's the policy that we're going to be following,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   how we're going to be communicating,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   and what we're asking you to do to let us know
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   what's going on so that we can practice
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   all the guidelines that are given to us
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   so we're going to do the best of our ability.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Our Sunday gathering, obviously,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   nothing is going to change.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   We're going to do our best to keep people
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   as safe as possible.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   We're going to do everything we need
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   in order for us to gather together safely.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So for that reason, right now,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   the SEEDS department, the children,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I think it's age three and four year olds
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   that was gathering,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   we temporarily shut that down for the next three weeks
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   because a lot of the teachers
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   had to kind of go into quarantine
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   and were exposed.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   So we want to make sure that we're keeping everybody safe.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   But we are planning that in early January
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   that we'll come back online
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   as soon as the teachers are able to do that.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Our elementary group,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   we're going to stay the same.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So we're running that still the same way.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So there's certain things
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I just want you to be careful about
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   because it's one thing for us
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   to practice our faith
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   and obviously we consider this an essential.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So there's no plans for us
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   to shut down our Sunday worship.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   But at the same time,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   this is one of those situations
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   that require a lot of wisdom and sacrifice
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   that we consider others better than ourselves.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   So yes, we do have the freedom
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   to practice our conscience,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   but the wisdom that the scripture teaches us
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   is that if it causes other people to stumble,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   right, that we make sure
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   that our behavior is not just for us,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   but make sure that our community,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   it doesn't bother their conscience either.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So we want to caution you
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   to be sensitive to other people
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   because people's different opinions
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   are very extreme, one end to the other.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And so be mindful of that.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   There are people who are coming to church
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   who are very, very concerned,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   yet because they consider
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   the Sunday worship to be
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   essential, that they are,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   despite their fears, they are coming
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and we don't want to force
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   our freedom upon them
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   where we're just going out
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and saying I have the right to do this and that.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   So just be careful.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And again, especially now in our community,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   we need to be more conscious than ever
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   just for the community that we belong to.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So use biblical principles
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   to follow what it means to be free,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   but what it also means to love
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   so that we can gather together
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   and make sure that everybody
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   is able to gather with a clear conscience.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Along with that, a few other announcements.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Berean membership class is starting again.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   The new session is January 17th.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's happening from 9 to 10 a.m.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   in Upper Room Cafe.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So if you want to be a member in the church,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   the email is natequackbereancc.com.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   You can sign up and there should be
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   some sort of a lead to that
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   in our church website,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   your app, or the Facebook page.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   New Year's Eve schedule.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   On December 31st,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I think originally we said 11.30,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   but we're going to have it at 11 p.m.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   in order for us to finish everything by 12.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   So we're going to say,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   get all that, you know,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   watch the year-end video,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   take some time to pray,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   a short devotion,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and then say Happy New Year
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   so that at 12 o'clock it will be done,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   and then people can go sleep,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   whatever you're going to do, okay?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   So it's going to be not 11.30, but 11.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And so there are no activities,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   it's going to be taking place at church,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   so just keep that in mind.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And also finally,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   for the Christmas service outreach,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   today is the last day to sign up,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   so if you haven't signed up and you're planning to,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   please do so as soon as you can.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So go online and look at the links
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and then you can sign up for that, right?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Today is the last day, right?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Confirmation, yes, today is the last day.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   No? Did I get this wrong?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Is today the last day to sign up for the Christmas?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Okay.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   If I'm not right,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   next week is the last day.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Next week is the last day, okay, okay.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   All right, so I got to correct the first service people.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   I said today.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   All right, next week is the last day.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   But move as if today is the last day, okay?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   So sign up as soon as you can
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   so that they can prepare ahead of time.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   All right, so we're going to take some time
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   to pray for our offering,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and again, a physical offering box is in the back
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   if you need to do so.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So we're going to pray.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Heavenly Father,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   we pray for your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   help us to give you worship
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   that is truly in spirit and in truth.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Pray that you would search our hearts, Lord God,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   and show us if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I pray that your word
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   that we would see a greater glimpse,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   greater glory of who you are,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   that we may reflect your grace
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and your love and your holiness
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Lord God, as you desire.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   May this worship be honoring to you
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and sanctifying to the church,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and even the offering that we give,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   may we give it generously,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   cheerfully, joyfully, Lord God,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   and may it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   - All right, before we get started,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   there's two things I forgot to mention to you
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   before we start.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   First of all, next Sunday is our Christmas service,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and so you receive this card.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Obviously, most people that you're gonna invite
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   may come online, so there is an online version.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   You can just cut and paste and invite your friends.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   But again, this is given to you as just a bookmark
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   for you to be reminded that, again,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   people who normally don't attend church
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   are willing to come to special events,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   especially Christmas service, and so we want to redeem
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   the opportunity that God has given us to do that.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   So next Sunday, when we have a Christmas service
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and we talk about the meaning of Christmas
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   and why Christ had to come, and so it'd be a good opportunity
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   to invite your non-Christian friends or family and friends
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   to come to that, so that's what this is for.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   The other part of it is, last year we took
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   a missions offering, the Lottie Moon missions offering
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   for our IMB, International Mission Branch
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   of our denomination, and so we're gonna be taking
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   mission offerings, so we want you to be prayerful
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   about that, and then next Sunday, we will be collecting
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   the mission offering, our brother's, Pastor Alex
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and his family, Harry and Linda, they're being supported
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   by the IMB, and so we're gonna be using that
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   to, again, give the offering to the IMB,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and they'll use that to support the missionaries.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So that's going on next Sunday, so please be
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   prayerful, mindful, we'll post that up on our Facebook
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and website, just to remind you next Sunday
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   that we'll be collecting for that, okay?
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   to Hebrews chapter 11, we're gonna be reading
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   from verse 17 to 19.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 17 to 19.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   "By faith, Abraham, when he was tested,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   offered up Isaac, and he who had received
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   the promises, was offering up his only begotten son.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   It was he to whom it was said, 'In Isaac,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   your descendants shall be called.'
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He considered that God is able to raise people
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   from the dead, from which he also received him
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   back as a type."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Let's pray.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would anoint
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   this time, and may your word be lifted up,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Lord God, that your voice and only your voice
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   may be heard.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Help us, Lord, not only to be hearers,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   but not to turn from it to the left or to the right,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   that we may be anchored in Christ,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   especially now with all that's going on.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   So we pray that you would bless this time,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   You know, because of what's been going on
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   around us with the pandemic,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   there's been a lot of question about what is
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   essential and non-essential.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And so I think everybody, to a certain degree,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and for sure as leaders, we've been having
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   constant conversations as what is essential,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   what is not essential, and obviously the gathering
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   of the believers on Sunday is not something
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   that we are willing to compromise.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   You know, we want to do our best to keep,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   you know, to keep the church safe.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   We want to submit to the authorities,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   as the Bible says, but at the same time,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   we do not want to compromise our essentials.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Now along with that, whether you are a leader
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   in the church or not, every single family
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   probably has been asking that question, right?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I hear that the toilet paper is starting to disappear,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   you know, just like in the beginning of
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   what was going on in March, people are going,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   "Just in case, we don't know what's going to happen."
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   So people are stocking up again.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   So what are the things that are essential
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   that you need to have, right?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   For whatever the reason, toilet paper,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   maybe water, some canned goods, right?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   What if the apocalypse happens?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   What happens?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Are you going to, you know, do you have a car
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   that you're going to be able to use?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   What are the essentials that you would gather?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I remember years ago, you know,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   when the Northridge earthquake hit,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   I had a friend who was in college
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and this condemned, the building that he was in,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   he was a Northridge college student,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   and the building was shaking
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   and it was actually condemned.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   But right after the shaking stopped,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   he ran out and to the dismay of his friends,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   he ran back in because he said
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   he needed to go get his essential stuff
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   and he went back in and grabbed his Bible
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   and his MacArthur commentaries.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And that's when we knew that this guy
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   was a MacArthur freak, you know?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He literally risked his life to go back
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and get his commentaries.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And then, sure enough, a day later,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   the whole building just collapsed, you know?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   So he literally, like, we know what was in his heart.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   He wanted his Bible and his commentaries.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   But for every single Christian,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   what is essential?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   What are some things,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   obviously there's some physical things that you'll get.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   If you have small children,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   obviously that's the first thing
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   that you'll run in and get.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But aside from the physical things,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   what is absolutely essential?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   The answer is pretty clear.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Our faith is absolutely essential.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And that's why, again, that we're gathering together
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   despite what's going on,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   because worship of our God and our faith
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   is absolutely essential.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Faith is what connects us to this eternal life,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   the father of, the author of life.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Without faith, it says,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   at the beginning of this chapter,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   it is impossible to please him.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And when he says that,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   he's not simply talking about, you know,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   God being pleased or displeased.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Without faith, there is no relationship with God.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So one of the most crucial, essential things
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   that we need to make sure that is genuine
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   is our faith.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   So Abraham, he says he's the father of faith.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   He's the father of faith because God initiated
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   a covenant relationship with the nation of Israel
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   through this man.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   That God was going to establish a nation
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   where through them, he's going to bless the world.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And obviously the son of God
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   was going to come through that line.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   But along with that,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Abraham is the perfect example
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   of what God desires of his people
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   to walk by faith.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And so in order to establish that
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   and to give us an example for us to follow,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   the cloud of witnesses that we are to follow
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   as an example, he tested his faith.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And that's what it says.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   The first thing that it says in verse 17,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   by faith, when he was tested,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   offered up Isaac.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   So Abraham's faith had to be tested.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Now, again, if you're a Calvinist,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   you may look at that and say,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   well, if God is sovereign,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   why does he have to know?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Didn't he already know?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Why did he have to test him?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Look at it this way.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Whenever we go out to purchase a car,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   we test the car, right?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Now, the buyer is the one testing the car,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   not the owner.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   The owner already knows what the car is.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And it's already out on display.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So the one who purchased it for himself
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   is the one who is actually testing it
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   to make sure that that is something
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   that he wants and to embrace.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   So in the same way,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   when the scripture says that God tested him,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   it was really to prove for Abraham,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   to make sure that he knew where he stood,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   to purify his faith.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   In 1 Peter 1, 6-7, he says,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   "In this you greatly rejoice."
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And he's talking about the persecution
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   and suffering that's coming.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   "Even though now for a little while,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   if necessary, you have been distressed
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   by various trials,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   so that the proof of your faith
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   being more precious than gold,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   which is perishable."
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   In other words,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   sometimes God will take what is perishable
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   in order to give us what is imperishable,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   a greater faith.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   "Even though tested by fire,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   may be found to result in praise and glory,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Because faith is the most valuable thing
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   that we possess,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   because that's what connects us to God,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   our process of sanctification
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   is to purify this faith,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   that we live by faith and not by sight.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And that's why Abraham is being tested.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Even though he walked out
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and followed God's command,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   every year of his life,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   every activity,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   every suffering that Abraham had to suffer through,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   it was to purify his faith.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And it's no different with us.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   If your faith in God hasn't grown
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   from the first time you met God until now,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   then you are not a mature Christian.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   A mature Christian is not somebody
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   who just knows the Bible,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   has much experience doing this and that
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and gone overseas and made disciples.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   That's not what makes you a mature Christian.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   A mature Christian, according to Scripture,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   is somebody who is increasing in his faith.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Because power that you and I have
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   is not within us.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It's our connection to God.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   So the greater the faith,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   the greater the connection that we have with God.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And that's what makes an individual mature.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Not what we accumulate from our experience
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and our learning, but God.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   As you guys know,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   if you want to buy a used car,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   which car is more expensive?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Toyotas and Camrys are usually more expensive.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And the reason why they're more expensive
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   is because there's a record,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   a proven track record,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   that they can possibly go up to 200,000, 300,000 miles,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   which is unheard of.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   When I was younger,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   if a car passed 100,000 miles or 150,000 miles,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   we considered that a very good car.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   So I remember years ago,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   my brother Phillip,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   he drove his Camry over 200,000 miles.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And I said, "Wow, Camry went 200,000 miles."
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I don't know if you've ever tried to look for a used car now.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Now they have people who are selling their cars
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   for thousands of dollars
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   that have gone over 250,000 miles.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Or 300,000 miles.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And they're usually Toyotas and Camrys.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And that's why they pay a premium,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   because they know if you're 200,000,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   there's a possibility you can go over another 100,000 miles.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Our faith, when it is not tested,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   it doesn't matter how passionate we are,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   it doesn't matter how much we know,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   it doesn't matter how much experience that we have,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   when it is not tested,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   we may be building our faith,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   building our Christian life,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   on a foundation that's shaky.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Anyone that God is going to use for his glory,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   that faith is first and foremost tested, proven.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   To make sure, because the strength of who we are
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   is directly linked to the strength of the faith
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   that we have in God.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   So that's what it says.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   It starts off by saying that Abraham's faith was tested.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   How was he tested?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Obviously, God asked him to offer up his son.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   His only begotten son.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   There's two things that I want to highlight here
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   about what God commands of Abraham
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   that demonstrates this faith.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   First of all, the test was to make sure that Abraham
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   trusted in the giver and not the gift.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   That his faith was founded upon the promises of God.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   That he recognized the fulfillment of the promise
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   was faithfulness God himself,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and not the gift that he received.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Hebrews chapter 11, 7-18, it says,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   "By faith Abraham, when he was tested,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   "offered up Isaac, and he had received the promises,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   "was offering up his only begotten son."
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Where'd you hear that term before?
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Of Jesus, right?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Only begotten.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Now, a lot of people get confused
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   because of the English word begotten,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and saying, "Well, doesn't begotten mean
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   "that God gave birth to Jesus?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   "So doesn't that mean that he was created by God?"
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Well, that word begotten does not mean that at all.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   In the Greek, it means mono, genus.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   The word mono genus, well, you get the word mono
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   obviously one, only.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Genus basically means from those people.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   The literal meaning of that is he's the only one, unique.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   In fact, in Genesis chapter 22,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   it kind of explains, maybe in better English term,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   now it came about after these things,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   that God tested Abraham and said to him,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and he said, "Here I am."
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   He said, "Take now your son, your only son."
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Your only son.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   That's what that word mono genus means.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   There's nobody like him.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   He's unique.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   It doesn't mean that he was created by God.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Now, why is this important?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   When he said that Isaac was his son, his only son,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   was that Abraham's only son?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Was Isaac Abraham's only son?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   No.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   He had Ishmael from his servant girl, Hagar.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   But what does he mean here when he says,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   "Isaac, your son, your only son?"
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   He's talking about his unique, begotten, only son, unique,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   because that's the line in which God was going to fulfill his covenant.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And so that's why he says in verse 18,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "It was he to whom it was said, 'In Isaac your descendants shall be called.'"
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Isaac is only begotten, the one and only,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   because that's the line in which God was going to fulfill
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   all the promises that he made to Abraham and Sarah.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Now, isn't that a strange thing to say?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   I want you to offer up your covenant child,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   your only covenant child,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   that everything that you have abandoned to follow me,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   where I am going to fulfill all your descendants,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   everything that I said to you in Genesis chapter 12, 1-3,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   he's the guy that I'm going to fulfill.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   All your descendants are going to come through this guy.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Offer him up.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I mean, that makes absolutely no sense.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Well, if he said, "You know what? Offer him up, because I have another child coming."
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   You know, they made the mistake the first time,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   because God wasn't acting fast enough,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   so by their own will, they had Hagar,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and they gave birth to Ishmael,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   and they said, "No, that's not the one," and God gives Isaac,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   and so maybe God has another child.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   But that's not what he said. No, he's that child. He's your only begotten son.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Your descendant, everything I promised you, is going to come through that line,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   and it's that child I'm commanding you to sacrifice.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   What was God doing?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   God was testing Abraham, again, to prove his faith,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   that is your confidence on the gift or the giver?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Is the hope that you have, the covenant that God made with you,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   is that covenant based upon the promise of God,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   or your child Isaac, your only begotten son?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Now, on the surface, it doesn't make any sense that God would command to offer up
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   what he said he's going to use to fulfill a promise,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   and yet, what God was doing was testing.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Where is your confidence?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   You know, there are things that God places in our lives
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   to help us to grow in our faith.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Just like if you go to a hospital, and you sprained your ankle,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   or you broke your leg, and they'll put a cast on,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   and they have you walk on a crutch.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And that crutch is good.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   In fact, it's even necessary to help you to walk.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   But imagine if you went in and said, "You know, I like this crutch.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Can I keep it on?"
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   So, well, it's been three months, your leg is fine.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   It's like, "No, no, no, it's not fine. I'd rather have the crutch."
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Imagine if you kept the crutch for six months to a year,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   two years, five years.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   For the rest of your life, you said, "I can't walk without this crutch."
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   So that very crutch that God gave you to help you
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   now has become a hindrance.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Because the purpose of the crutch was to get you to be healed and to be whole.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   There's a lot of things that we do in our life where we thank God for the gift,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   and then the gift becomes the problem.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   We make it a crutch that is necessary.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And we make the gift the idol.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I run into a lot of college students.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   While they were in college, they had a leader, a follower,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and they had certain kind of freshmen, and older brother, younger sister,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   and discipleship, and they experienced this Christian life in this bubble.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And then when they graduate, they can't function.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Because they need that again.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   In order for me to have God, "Where's my leader? Who's my follower?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Who's my this? And how come the organization is this way and that way?"
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And they made this crutch a necessity for their walk with God.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   The purpose of it is to bring us to God.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   The purpose of why He gave the church is to bring us to God.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Think how often we make the gift that God has given us
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   into a burden because we make that the idol.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Sometimes we do that even with the church.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   It's great to have the church, great to have the fellowship,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   but I can't grow without it.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I can't meet God without it.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And then it becomes a crutch.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Remember in John 5, 39-40, you search the scriptures
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   because you think that in them you have eternal life.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   How often does the Word of God become a burden
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   because this is something that every good Christian should do?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   We need to exposit, we need to memorize,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   and we need to know systematic theology.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   If you're a good Christian, you need to pray 15 minutes, an hour,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   you need to do it in the morning, you need to memorize,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   and then you make this the idol.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   So when you have this, you think, "Oh, that's a good Christian
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   because he's read the Bible so many times and knows his systematic theology,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   he knows how to exegete, he knows how to teach other people."
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   But Jesus is saying you're looking through scriptures thinking that somehow
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   if you look at it and obey it, that's where eternal life is.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   It's a no, but purpose of this is to bring you to Christ.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   So you can spend all your life maturing in knowledge and experience
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and never have greater and increasing faith in Christ.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Look what he says.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   You look to scripture because you think that in them you have eternal life.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   It is these that testify about me.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And you are unwilling to come to me so that you may have life.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   He wanted to make sure that Isaac was not his hope.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   He wanted to make sure that he wasn't hanging all his hopes upon his health.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Imagine if Isaac was everything hinged upon Isaac.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   I mean, imagine.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   It's like he had to have the best seats.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   You know, I mean, you'd freak out every time he gets sick.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   If any of his brothers somehow, you know, incringes upon anything,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   it's like, "Oh, you're not just protecting your son. You're protecting your hope."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   He wanted to make sure that he didn't make Isaac his idol.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Look at the way that the Pharisees approached the Sabbath.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   God told them to keep the Sabbath holy, but they wanted to keep it so holy
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   that they created additional laws on top of what God said.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   So they kept on accusing Jesus of breaking the Sabbath.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   He never broke the Sabbath.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   He broke their application of the Sabbath.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   The tradition that they created saying, "You know what?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Keeping the Sabbath means that you can go this far,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   but if you go beyond that, you're breaking the Sabbath."
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   So they were judging people based upon what they thought breaking the Sabbath meant.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Not what the Bible said, but what they thought breaking the Sabbath meant.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   So they kept on saying, "Why are you breaking the Sabbath?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Why are you breaking the Sabbath?"
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Jesus answered them in Mark 2, 27.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   So the man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   The very name Sabbath means to rest.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   And you made it a to-do list.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   And instead of finding rest and making Christ Lord of the Sabbath,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   it becomes an additional burden for you to carry out.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Instead of bringing you to Christ, it's keeping you away from Christ.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   And that's what he was saying. He was reversing that.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   He said, "You missed the whole point of the Sabbath.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Sabbath was made for you so that you can recuperate,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   so you can rest, so you can worship God,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   so your faith would increase in who He is."
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   But because you made it into rules,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   now Sabbath is destroying you.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   That's exactly what John was trying to say in the book of John.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   What Jesus was saying with the seven "I am" statements.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   People were coming to Him and said, "You're eating bread and you want more bread."
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   He says, "I am the bread."
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   You're looking for the Messiah to come.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   And just like God used the clouds and the light,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   the pillar of light to lead people,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   you're looking for the Messiah to come and shed light.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   He says, "I am the light."
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   You're looking for, like, you know, which, where do we go?
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Do we want to be part of the synagogue?
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Do we want to be accepted in a community?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   And Jesus says, "I am the door."
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   They were begging Him, "Won't You come and make sure that our brother Lazarus
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   lives a little bit longer? Make him healthy so that he doesn't die."
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   And Jesus allows him to die so that He can make it point.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   These are the people who are looking for leaders to guide them and lead them.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Who should we follow? The Pharisees or the Sadducees?
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And Jesus says, "I am the Good Shepherd."
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Where do we go? If you leave us, where are we going to go?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   He says, "I am the way and the truth and the life."
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Well, if you leave us, how are we going to bear fruit?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   How are we going to know what to do? Jesus says, "I am the vine."
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Every one of these "I am" statements is to shatter through the idols
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   that they were hanging their hats on and then saying, "I am."
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   That's exactly what He was trying to teach Abraham.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Even though Isaac is the promised child, the only begotten child,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   the promise isn't based upon Isaac and his health and how long he's going to live,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   how many children he's going to have, because there's going to come times
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   when that's not going to make sense.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   He may come to the verge of death, but you should not be shaken.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   He might even die, but your faith should not be shaken.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Because the promise is not based upon him, but God.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Abraham, by this time, knew this.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   That was not the faith that he had. He believed in God enough to walk out,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   but that's not the faith that he had early on.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Remember early on, he was like, "How come it's taking so long?"
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   He was going to fulfill it himself because he couldn't see what God was going to do.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   It was hard in the beginning, but after 25 years, when he turned 100,
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   his wife was 90 years old, now it's impossible.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   But by this time, what does he say? Genesis 22.3, when God told him,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   he just said, "Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and just left."
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Now, I'm not sure if Abraham said anything because it's not recorded,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   but all it says was he believed God and he just did it.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Because he believed that even if he dies, he can raise him.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   In other words, I trust him. He's proven himself to me.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   When times I didn't believe him and I questioned him,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   and I self-willed myself to fulfill this promise,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   he broke into all of that and he showed me to trust him.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And that's what he was trying to fulfill here.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And that's why in Psalm 20.7, the psalmist says,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   "Some trust in chariots, some trust in horses, but we trust the name of the Lord."
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   So that's a lesson that every person of faith not only needs to have,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   but continue to increase and grow.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   That the stability and foundation of the refuge
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   does not base upon who's around us, promises of the economy,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   who's going to be the leader, how much money did you save for retirement,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   do you have enough friends around you, what community do you belong to,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   but in the end, all that God promises hinges upon his faithfulness
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   despite all that happens around us.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Secondly, the test is to prove something even deeper than that.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   The test was to see whom Abraham loved.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   It says in Genesis 22, 1-2, "Now it came about after these things
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   that God tested Abraham and said to him, 'Abraham,' and he said, 'Here I am.'
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   And he said, 'Take now your son, your only son,'"
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   and then he has "whom you love," and "offer him."
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I mean, can you imagine how much this child was loved?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   They left everything, risked everything, and they waited for so long.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Every once in a while, you'll--and maybe some of you are in that category
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   where you wanted a child for so long, and you prayed and prayed,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   and you thought maybe you weren't going to have a child,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   and you saw all the other people having children,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   and the pain that kind of comes with that, like, "Why isn't God blessing me?"
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And then when you lost all hope, and then you have a child, right?
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   I've walked with some people who went through that.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   I had a friend who actually was a pastor of a church nearby,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   and he prayed for over 10, 11 years, and didn't have a child.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   And they were almost kind of getting ready to, like,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   "Okay, maybe that's just going to be our lot in life,"
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   and he was ready to move on, and for 10 years, that's what he was praying for,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   and then on the 11th year, he had kids.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And I don't even have to describe to you the kind of joy that fell on this family.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   Can you imagine how much joy was brought to this family?
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Sarai was barren before she trusted God, and waited years,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   and when they tried to fulfill it, it caused all kinds of problems with Ishmael.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   "No, trust me."
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   And they actually named the son Isaac because it was so hard to believe.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   They laughed. They giggled.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   I think the name Isaac laughed is given for two reasons.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   One, because in unbelief, they turned around, they laughed.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   But the second reason, Sarai means princess.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Sarah means joy and delight.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Isaac was the fulfillment of that joy and delight.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   That's why he's named Isaac, because of the way they reacted
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   and because of what God intended to bring into that home.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   So I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that he was very, very, very loved.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   In fact, I don't think, again, it's an exaggeration.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   I think we would all agree he was probably the most precious thing that they had.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   And God not only said he's the fulfillment of your promise,
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   he's something that you love more than anything else.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Offer him up.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   I mean, put yourself in that situation.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Not only is sacrificing Isaac means the future and everything else that God said,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   but even if that wasn't the case,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   even if he wasn't the fulfillment of all of that,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   just offering up your son that you love so much,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   that you enjoyed so much, brought so much delight into your lives,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   and for God said to offer him up.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   God was not only testing to see his faith, he was testing to see his affection.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Who do you love? What do you love more than anything else?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   I mean, the Bible clearly says the greatest command that God desires from us
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   That's what he desires more than anything else.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   That's why in the book of Revelation, when he talks to the church of Ephesus,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   he says you have right doctrine, you persevere, you have a lot of good works.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   On the surface, they have everything that a good church should have.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   And he says, yet I have this one thing against you.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   You have forsaken your first love.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   The word for first here is protos.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Protos is not the word that they would use to describe first, second, third, or fourth.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Protos basically means in priority.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   The most.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   So when he says proto agapen,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   he's basically saying you're doing all the externally, you're doing all of these things,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   but I'm not your greatest love.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   I'm not your greatest love.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   God is not simply saying you should love me.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   I think most Christians will say that we love God to a certain degree.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Whether it's small love or big love, we say we love God.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   We sing about him.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Is he our greatest love?
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   Protos agapen.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   Remember when Peter denies Christ and then after the resurrection,
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   he sees them at the shore and he restores Peter.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   John chapter 21, 15-17.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   He said to him, yes Lord, you know that I love you.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   He said, tend my lambs then.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   He said to him again a second time, Simon son of John, do you love me?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   He said to him, yes Lord, you know that I love you.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   He said to him, shepherd my sheep.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   He said to him a third time, Simon son of John, do you love me?
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, do you love me?
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   And he said to him, Lord, you know all things.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   You know that I love you.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Jesus said to him, tend my sheep.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Some people have taken this tax and said, you know what,
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   the reason why he asked him three times is because Peter answered wrong.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   So in the Greek, Jesus asked, do you agape me?
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   And the first time he says, yes Lord, you know I phileo you.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   And then the second time Jesus says, do you agape me?
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   And he says, yes Lord, you know I phileo you.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Third time Jesus says, do you really phileo me?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   And Jesus said, you know all things, Lord.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   You know I phileo you.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   So some people have looked at that and said, you know, God was asking for agape
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   and he said phileo, so he got it wrong.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   So the third time Jesus gave in.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   Clearly you're not going to agape me, so do you phileo me?
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   I'm going to accept a lesser love, phileo, so he said yes.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   That's how some people look at that, and I don't think that's what's going on.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Because in the Greek, the word agape and phileo is often used interchangeably,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   and this is a perfect example of that.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Because when Jesus asked you agape me, Peter doesn't say, no, I phileo you.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   He says, yes, I phileo you.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Do you agape me? Yes, Lord.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Of course I phileo you.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Jesus said, do you really phileo me?
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   And he got hurt.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   If he was answering wrong, right, he said, why would he get hurt?
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Clearly you're failing the exam.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Clearly I'm asking you agape, you're saying phileo, and Jesus gave in.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   He said, no, it was being used interchangeably.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Then why does he ask him three times?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Because the number three is the number of completion.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   So if you read in the Bible, it says where two or three are gathered together.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   Do not entertain an accusation against it unless there's two or three.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   The number three Jesus was crucified was resurrected on the third day
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   to make sure that he actually was dead so that the resurrection was actually a resurrection.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   So the number three is the number of completion, of completeness.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   So when Peter denied Jesus, he said he denied him how many times?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Three times.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   Now why did he deny him three times?
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Maybe if he denied once, he'd say, oh, that was a slip of his tongue.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   He was just under pressure.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   He said, no, he denied him three times, meaning that it was a very willful rejection.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   So in order to restore him, he restores him three times.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Do you love me?
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   Just as it was confirmed that he denied Christ, it is confirmed his love for him.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   But you know what's interesting here?
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   If he failed that exam to be loyal to Christ, you would think that that's what he would say.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   Especially if he's going to be established to feed the sheep.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Now I'm going to go.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   When I was going to the cross, it was a test.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   It wasn't the final test.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   It was kind of like a quarter test.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   It only counts for 10%.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Now this one's going to count for all your grade.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   So you failed that time, so don't fail this time.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   So when I leave, you better not deny me.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   You would think that that's what Jesus would be asking.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   Are you going to stay loyal?
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Yes, Lord.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   You sure you're going to stay loyal?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   Yes, Lord.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   You better not fail.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   You sure you're going to stay loyal?
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Because after I leave and you fall, James and John's going to fall.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   Matthew for sure is going to fall.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   Peter the zealot for sure is going to fall.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   They're all going to fall, so you better get this right.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   That's not what he says.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   In order to establish him, to use him, the only thing that he checks is,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   "Do you love me? Do you love me?"
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   Not, "Are you going to fail me?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   Are you sure you're going to be pure?
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   Are you going to get your doctrines right?
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   Are you sure you're going to be disciplined?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   Are you sure you know how to make disciples?
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   Are you sure you're going to be holy?"
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   No, "Do you love me?"
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   But not only does he ask him, "Do you love me?"
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   He said, "Do you love me more than these?"
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   So there's a debate as to what the "these" he's talking about.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Obviously, he was fishing, so some people say he's pointing to the fish.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Right?
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   "Do you love me more than sushi?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   Do you love me?"
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   So some people say maybe that's one of the interpretations.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   That because Jesus was referring to Peter's statement before he went to the cross,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   he said, "You know, all of them are going to fail you, but I will not."
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   So it could be that Jesus is pointing to the disciples.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   "Do you love me more than these guys here?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   They may fail me again. Are you?"
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   I thought that that was a better interpretation.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   But I think there's a reason why that's left ambiguous.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   Because I don't think he was necessarily referring to one particular thing.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   When he says "these," he's talking about everything else,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   which includes sushi,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   which includes the other companions.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   "Do you love me more than these?"
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   More than anything else.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   And even your own life.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   I believe that that's what Jesus was asking him.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Because that's what God is pursuing with us.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   He's not simply saving us so that we don't go to hell.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   That in and of itself, we should be praising God.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   The fact that he knows our name alone should cause us to be all in worshiping God.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   But he made us his son,
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   so that we can come into the inner chamber of God and call him our Abba Father,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   to enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   We become co-heirs with Christ.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   He's not pursuing a proper legal standing in eternity.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   He adopted us.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   He loved us.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   So we love him back.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Isn't that the greatest reward?
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   Isn't that the greatest reward if you, you know,
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   like people in our church are adopting children,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   and we're very encouraged by that?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   The greatest reward of adopting a child is not he become an Olympic champion,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   and one day I'm going to be famous because of this child.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   Imagine the pressure that that child is under.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   That he's going to be a famous baseball star.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   That he's going to found another Facebook, and he's going to become a millionaire.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   Imagine if somebody actually adopted a child with that intent.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   How that would ruin that child.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   It would have been better for him to be orphaned.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   No, the greatest reward that a child can give to parents who adopted him is what?
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   To embrace his parents as his own.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   To love them as much as they loved that child.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   It's clear that that's what God is pursuing with us.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   That's why even when Paul told Timothy to teach certain men not to teach false doctrines,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   he makes sure he qualifies that because he's sending him to battle, and he says,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   "But the goal of this instruction is love."
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Love.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   Not simple purity, not simple doctrinal correctness.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   It's love.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   To make sure that when you enter into this battle, that you examine yourself.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   You make sure that this goal, the end product of it, isn't simply we got the right doctrine,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   we're doing the right thing, we're organized a certain way,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   but that what comes out of that is greater love.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   You know, I'm starting to get at that age where one by one, my close friends that I have,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   they have had children a little bit before me, are starting to have kids who are getting married,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   and then some of them, a few of them, are starting to have grandkids.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   You know?
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   So it's surreal.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   It's not like when we first got married, we'd say, you know, we were young,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   and say, "Who's going to get married first?"
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   And, "Well, that person got married, this person got married."
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   So I have roommates and I have friends that we've known for a long time,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   and now, you know, their kids are a little bit older, they're in their mid to late 20s,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   and so now they're having kids, and so I asked them, "So what is it like being a grandparent?"
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   You know?
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   And they said, "Most of the time, it's awesome."
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   Right?
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   I said, "So what's different?"
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   They said, "Man, when we were parents,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   we were so busy raising the kids that we didn't enjoy them.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Now we just enjoy them."
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   We said, "We love them just as much.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   We love our grandkids as much as we love our own children,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   but we didn't enjoy our kids like we enjoy the grandkids."
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   So much of what we do as Christians,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   we get so wrapped up in trying to be good Christians,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   and we miss the whole point of why God saved us.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   We get caught up in trying to fix the church,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   not realizing the church is a gift to us to enjoy.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   We get so caught up preaching the gospel that we don't celebrate the gospel.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   We get so caught up in trying to make godly marriages
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   that we don't actually enjoy the marriage.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   We work so hard to be obedient and follow God
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   that we don't actually enjoy God and worship God.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   He came to give life and to give life abundantly.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   The best way to thank God is to enjoy the life that He has given us
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   and to love Him in response.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   And so church is an avenue for us to do that.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   Fellowship is to remind us to do that.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   We study the Word of God so that would take us so that we could love God.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   But if we're not careful, we can make all that God has given us,
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   just like the Pharisees made the Sabbath.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Be burdened by the church, burdened by the fellowship, burdened by commands.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   And if the central thing that you and I have fallen short of is the glory of God,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   shouldn't the primary thing that God restores is His glory?
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   To be in all of His glory.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   I mean, that guy really loves God.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   That lady really loves God.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   What happened? What is it about God that He would love God that much?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   But if we're not careful, we make idols of the gift that God has given us,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   and we give so much of our energy, hope, into the crutch that God may have given
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   so that we can walk better.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   And then now that has become a burden.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   See, Isaac, he loved more than anything else.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   But remember the covenant that God made with Abraham was not to be burdensome
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   because God gave it to him unilaterally.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   It was a gift.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   You know, when two people get married, the Christian answer that we give,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   "For the glory of God, two are better than one."
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   We work better. It's kind of like, you know, you put two horses together, they work harder.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Right? So we're yoked for God's work.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   And that's the answer that we give because we're programmed to give theologically correct answers.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   But if you ask people, like, "Why do you get married?"
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   They say, "She's pretty."
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Right? "Don't act godly."
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Give you a real answer.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   Like the way she looked, the way she tied her ponytail, like the way she smells.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   And she happened to love Jesus.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   You get married because you want to get married.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   You were never burdened to get married.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   You get married because you want to get married.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   You want to because you're happy when you're with her.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   You'd rather be with her than your smelly friends.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   God gave Eve to Adam, right, as a gift.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   God gave the church to us as a gift.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   God gave our salvation as a gift.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   And instead of thanking him and loving him for the gift that he's given,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   we are so busy trying to get it right
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   and completely forget the central reason why he saved us.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   To enjoy him and to glorify him forever.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   That's why he's tested.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   To make sure that his faith is founded upon his word,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   that our greatest love is where we get the greatest joy.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   So as we open up the communion table,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   communion table is meant for celebration, right,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   for those who committed their life to Christ,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   and you know what I'm talking about, right?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   So again, I want to remind you, the communion table is for the baptized believers.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   So if you have not been baptized, please come see one of the leaders,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   and we'll walk you through if you need to be baptized.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   For those of us who are celebrating, the purpose of this is to remind us to recalibrate.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   If we've drifted from God in any way,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   if we've, again, made the walk with God a burden
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   instead of a celebration of who he is,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   that we come to celebrate. It's not by our works.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   We don't participate in this because we're righteous.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   We don't participate in this because you were good this week.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   We participate in this because of the gift that he has given us.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   So I'm going to pray for us,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   and then we're going to open up the communion table,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   and so we're going to do it together, okay?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   So what I would like you to do is to take a few minutes in preparation.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 11,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   And when he had given things, he broke it and said,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   So what I would like you to do,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   we're going to have communion music in the back,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   and to take the time as the music is going
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   to really pray and examine our hearts so that we don't put spinning on worthy men.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   If you have sense to confess, take some time to confess.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   If you have a relationship that's been broken that you need to restore,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   take some time to really come before the Lord and say,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   "Lord, help me."
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   I want to be obedient to you, I want to honor you,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   I want to celebrate what you've done for me.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   So take some time to meditate and to pray,
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   and afterwards, I will pray and we will all do it together.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   So don't do it now, at the end of that we'll do it together,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   and then the worship team will lead us to the end of the communion service.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   So let's take some time to pray.

[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   Lord, you are our refuge.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   Not the promises of man, not our bank account, not our politicians.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   You are our refuge.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   Lord, help us to be reminded of that.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   That we would build our lives, Lord, on solid foundation of who you are and your promises.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   Lord, you truly are worthy of our adoration.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   Help us to love you above everything else.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   Help us, Lord God, to worship you because we adore you.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   Help us to come to your word that we may know you more.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   Help us to be disciples, Lord God, because we want to be like you.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   Help us to be evangelists, Lord God, because we want others to know this and to love you as well.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   So we pray, Father God, that the word that you've implanted in us would bear fruit.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   Especially, Lord, as the world gets darker and there's increase in wickedness.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   Spare us, Lord God, from temptation, that our love would not grow cold, but rather be flamed stronger than ever.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   Help us to be anchored in Christ this week as we continue to walk a life of faith for your glory.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   Amen.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   [Praying in Tongues]
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   [Praying in Tongues]
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   [Praying in Tongues]
