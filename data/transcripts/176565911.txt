[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening, and we thank you, Lord God, for your living
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.780]   word.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.600]   It's a constant reminder of your grace and your love as we are prone to wander, and we
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.400]   desire, Lord God, to give you our best.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.820]   And we pray, Father God, as we study your word and recognize how patient you've been
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.800]   with us and to your people, Lord God, throughout history, and how you are reliable, you are
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280]   faithful, you are a sovereign God, Lord, that all your promises come true.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.560]   So we pray that with that confidence that we may truly live a life worthy of the calling
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.060]   that you've given us.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.960]   So we ask for your grace over this time, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   Alright, I know it's a bit hot, but there are two air conditioners that are working.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.260]   How many of you in the room are sitting under a vent that's actually working?
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.440]   There should be, the middle section, there should be some vents working, because there's
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.840]   two thermostats that are actually working.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.920]   How many of you guys are not hot?
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.720]   Yeah not hot.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   It's blowing somewhere.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   Huh?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   I mean, it'll help the table.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.960]   It's alright, just sit tight.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:53.280]   Probably the temperature will drop a little bit.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:03.800]   Alright okay, if you guys can take a look, Isaiah 60, 1 through 9.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   So again, a continuation of Isaiah 60, describes what's happening.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.320]   So the first chapter that we're looking at, chapter 61 through 9, it begins by saying,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.120]   "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you."
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.280]   And basically it's obviously a promise of rescue.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.000]   So in the previous chapter, it talked about the darkness that Israel was in, and so chapter
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.560]   60 begins by promise of the Redeemer coming and rescuing them.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   And what I want to note in this passage is where he says that as a result of His glory
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.360]   coming and being restored back into Israel, that all the nations are going to come to
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:57.200]   them because they're going to see the glory of God resting upon them.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.140]   So again, I mean, this is a lesson that we are taught over and over again, and for whatever
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.320]   the reason, we have a tendency to kind of sidetrack, but again, in a nation of Israel,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.580]   they try so hard by their own effort to be a great nation, by allying themselves with
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.720]   certain other groups, or trying to be victorious militarily, and none of that.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.480]   The more they struggled with their own might, they struggled, and they would actually bring
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.600]   upon them judgment.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.320]   But at the end times, the Lord says that when He comes, when He reveals His glory, and His
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.040]   glory is upon the nation of Israel, what immediately happens?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.360]   They begin to shine, and then all the nations begin to come to them because they see the
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.480]   glory of God resting upon them.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.560]   So in the end, it's related to the questions that we've been talking about.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.840]   The primary way that God glorifies Himself and does evangelism is when the glory of God
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.320]   is evident in the church, in His people.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.360]   It never works when we say, "Listen to what I say, but don't look at what I do."
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   It never works.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.280]   He's like, "Oh, it's the gospel, it's the same truth, who it comes from."
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.480]   But the attraction that they have toward God is going to come through the attraction to
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.240]   the church.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.200]   So when the glory of God is evident in the life of the Christian, that's when non-Christians
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   are attracted.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.480]   You try so hard to share the gospel with people, but if they don't see the glory of God upon
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.240]   you, then it's going to be futile.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.360]   And that's basically what the nation of Israel's history, constantly by their own effort, all
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.040]   that happened to them was destruction and judgment day came upon them.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.800]   But at the end, as soon as the glory of God comes and restored unto Israel, everything
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.200]   else gets restored.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.920]   City gets restored, wealth gets restored, health gets restored.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.960]   And then even them coming, they become a super nation that what they couldn't do by their
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.720]   own might, it just happens when the glory of God comes and rests upon them.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.960]   So again, this is a constant reminder to us as a church that the most important thing
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.120]   that every Christian, every church needs to do is to abide in Him.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.360]   If we're not abiding in Him, don't worry about, "Are we doing evangelism?"
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.040]   Don't worry about, "Oh, do I feel connected or do I have enough Christian friends?"
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.760]   Don't worry about all that stuff, because all of that stuff is superficial if you're
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.600]   first and foremost, if you're not abiding in Christ.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   Again, that's individually and as a church.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.520]   How will they react?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.200]   So when the Lord comes in His full glory, the Gentile nation shall see it and be attracted
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   to the light.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.920]   It says, "Even kings will be attracted to the brightness of Israel's rising.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.720]   This will be ultimately fulfilled in the millennial kingdom."
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Revelation chapter 20, 3 to 8.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.800]   Now one of the questions that I ask, I think we're going to answer in a little bit, is,
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.560]   is the fulfillment of these prophecies, is it talking about eternal heaven or is he talking
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   about an earthly fulfillment?
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.480]   I'm going to give you the answer now.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.200]   Some of you guys, it may be going over your head, but I think it's important for us, at
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.840]   least for you to recognize that when we talk about these prophecies that God makes to Israel
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.320]   and to the nations, that there are two views.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.920]   One view is that the church has replaced Israel, so all of this is just referring to heaven.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:53.000]   All of this is referring to heaven, so it's an ultimate fulfillment in heaven.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.360]   But what I believe that is a millennial kingdom, and I'm going to explain that a little bit,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   that this is an earthly fulfillment.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.840]   So if you look at the book of Revelation chapter 20, starting from verse 3, you'll see the
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.240]   language that he uses starting from verse 3.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.460]   It says, "And threw him into the pit and shut it and sealed it over him so that he might
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.720]   not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were ended."
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.040]   Now the thousand years, that's where we get the term millennial kingdom, right?
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.640]   Because it's for a thousand years.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:34.400]   So if you look at it, he says that Satan is bound so that he cannot be deceived.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.880]   Is it permanent or not permanent?
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.040]   It's not permanent, right?
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   He's bound for a thousand years, and then he gets released for whatever else he's going
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.720]   to do at the end.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:54.260]   So there's a period of a thousand years where God prophesies in those millennial kingdoms
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.020]   where he describes about all the prophecies being fulfilled.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.520]   Now if that was referenced to eternal kingdom, then how could that be something that happens?
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.540]   We go into the kingdom and then Satan gets released and deceives one more time, right?
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.480]   That's not the only place, I'm not going to go too deep into that, but there's other things
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.280]   that I'm going to mention in this text.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.600]   Why we believe, or I believe, that this is referenced to an earthly fulfillment.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.200]   That God is not done with Israel.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.840]   God's promises to Israel are still going to stand.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.040]   It doesn't mean that this isn't relevant to Christians, but the specific fulfillment of
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.000]   his promise to the nation of Israel is going to happen to the nation of Israel.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Okay?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.680]   Now if that went over your head, don't worry about it.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.480]   Those of you who are curious about it, we can talk more about it.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.040]   But again, I believe that this is a millennial kingdom, and then I'll explain a little bit
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   more.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.160]   This is in reference to the Jewish converts remaining on earth, that all of them will
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.560]   be gathered together.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.040]   That when God fulfills these promises that he made to the nation of Israel, remember,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.880]   again, when Jesus is crucified and then he resurrects, right before he goes up, what
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.840]   do the disciples ask Jesus?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.320]   Is it now?
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.880]   Is it now that you're going to fulfill the kingdom?
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   Right?
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.920]   That's the question he asks in Acts chapter 1.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.080]   And Jesus says to him, "It is not for you to know the time or the hour."
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.120]   And then that's when he says, "But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   you."
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.160]   So he doesn't say the kingdom is just going to be in the future and don't worry about
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.560]   it, right?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.200]   So there's a fulfillment of his promise, because when the Jews thought about kingdom,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.260]   you can imagine why.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:51.520]   If you read chapters 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, if you read that, if you were following along,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.920]   if you were a Jew, wouldn't you have thought, wouldn't you have been excited about Jesus'
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   coming?
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.320]   Wouldn't you have thought, this is what you thought was going to be fulfilled?
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.000]   Are you following along?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.480]   Some of you, the heat's getting to you.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.240]   I can see it.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   Okay?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.520]   So if you were to, if you read chapter 60 and 61, right, just in this passage, and the
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.920]   things that you read just this week, it's not just those passages, but just look at
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.600]   this week, talking about their wealth is going to be restored, they're going to be healthy,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.280]   all the nations are going to come bow down to them, they're going to be the super nation,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.640]   their old cities are going to be rebuilt, they're going to basically overthrow the Roman
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.880]   government, at least that's what you would think, based upon this, and that the Messiah
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.660]   is going to rule over them perfectly, the perfect king.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:47.320]   So when Jesus came, can you imagine the excitement that this is going to be fulfilled?
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.840]   Right?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.920]   Why would any Jew think otherwise?
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.680]   Jesus rebukes them.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.000]   He says, "Only if you knew today," like when he was going into Jerusalem, "Only if you
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.520]   knew today, what would truly bring peace, but because you did not know."
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.420]   Like the Dutch judgment is coming upon Jerusalem.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.500]   But if you read this as a Jew, no Jew read this, right?
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.320]   No Jew read this, because he says, and I'm going to talk about it in a little bit, are
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.760]   the Jews and the Gentiles mixed together in this passage?
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   He's not.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   He's not.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   Right?
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   The Jews are elevated above the Gentiles.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.680]   So they thought that if the Messiah came, he was going to establish this kingdom, but
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.080]   what is it that they missed?
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   What is it that they missed?
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   >> That it was for both.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   >> Huh?
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   >> That it was for both, do you hear me?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:52.040]   >> Uh, I, no, when Jesus came, right, they were so fixated on the kingdom, because this
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.560]   is the description of this kingdom, right?
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.520]   And so they were fixated, when the kingdom comes, were you going to, will you let me
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.360]   sit on to the left or to the right, you know, is it now, even after the resurrection, is
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.960]   it now, are you going to now bring the kingdom, like these prophecies, are you going to now
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.840]   fulfill it now, right?
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.240]   They were fixated on this.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.640]   But if you read this, wouldn't you have thought the same thing?
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:20.160]   >> Although there's many parts of the scripture that talk about the political kingdom, they
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.400]   just overrided all the parts that talk about personal holiness, personal salvation, holiness
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   within, all those parts that talk about a personal salvation, a personal relationship
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.800]   with the Messiah, they just glossed over it, and they focused only on the political kingdom.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.000]   So it wasn't that they were incorrect in thinking there's going to be a future political kingdom,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.200]   it was that they negated other parts of the scriptures, and they talked about looking
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   towards God as their king.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   >> Right, right.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.600]   So if you were a Jew and you're reading this and you chose to focus your attention upon
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.400]   chapter 60 and 61 and then the other chapters and say, wow, God's going to fulfill this,
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.280]   but what does he say before he comes here?
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:04.600]   What is a very important passage about the fulfillment of this before we get to chapter
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.760]   60?
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.320]   Chapter 53, chapter 53 basically says, before this kingdom comes and he restores us, what
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.320]   happens?
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.560]   He's going to come and he's going to what?
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   He's going to suffer for our sins.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   That's the part that they just kind of glossed over.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.160]   They didn't understand it, right?
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.560]   Because he wasn't just going to ignore their sins.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.880]   He wasn't just going to say, oh, you know what, you've been sinning and you constantly
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.280]   rebel and you go after idols, but there's going to come a day where he's going to forget
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   all of that, right?
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.680]   One day he's not going to keep you accountable, that your sins over and over again, that he's
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.080]   just going to decide one day, you know what, you know, I've been angry over your sins all
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.360]   this time, but when that time comes, I'm just going to forget all of it.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.120]   Is that what he says?
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.360]   No.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.160]   He said, how is he going to fulfill this?
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.000]   Chapter 53, right?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.200]   He's not just going to sweep their sins under the rug.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.800]   He said the Messiah is going to come, right?
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.320]   All of us like sheep have gone astray, each of us to his own way, but the Lord laid on
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.040]   him the iniquity of us all.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.200]   That's the part that they didn't get.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.120]   The way he was going to fulfill this was by dealing with sin where his justice and his
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.300]   mercy and righteousness was not going to be compromised.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.200]   So they skipped over, you know, we did all of this, we did it, you know, and we cried
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.640]   out to God and then just God just one day decided like, okay, forget it.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.040]   I'm just going to do the millennial kingdom, right?
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:39.080]   He said, no, that's the part where Jesus came and said that had to be, that had to be fulfilled,
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   right?
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.840]   So he said, if you look at Romans chapter 11, he said that the Jews have experienced
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.280]   a hardening of their heart temporarily until the fullness of the number of Gentiles have
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.840]   come in and then the Jews will be grafted back in to the kingdom.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.360]   And that period is referring to the millennial kingdom, right?
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.340]   God is going to literally fulfill the promises that he made, right?
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.160]   And again, the other interpretation of that is we have a school of thought where people
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.800]   just kind of spiritualize everything.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.280]   All of that is just a thousand years represents perfection.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.040]   You know, the church represents the nation of Israel.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.720]   So all of that is not being, it's just being fulfilled in the church.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.240]   And now we are living in that millennial kingdom.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.720]   That's what they, that's what they say, right?
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.240]   But again, the problem with that is Satan is not bound.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.040]   Revelation just says Satan's going to be bound and then he's going to be released after a
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   thousand years.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.800]   If this is the thousand year reign of Christ, then why is he not bound?
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   Right?
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.760]   Anyway, so that's enough of that.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.420]   So if you have any questions about that, we can get into more discussion, but we believe,
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:52.800]   I believe that this is, this is being fulfilled at the end times during the millennial reign
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   of Christ.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.880]   And then after that comes the, comes the judgment and then we enter into kingdom for eternity.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   Okay.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.840]   Now I'm going to go a little bit more into that as we talk.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840]   Okay.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.520]   So Jesus says that at the end, not only will they be gathered, he said, the foreign nations
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:14.840]   are also going to come to them and they're functioning like priests.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.200]   So during that period, so in the, in the heavenly kingdom, we don't have priests, right?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.840]   Jesus Christ is the only, only mediator between us and God.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.200]   But during the millennial kingdom, the Jews are going to be functioning.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.800]   The Israelites are going to be functioning as the priests, right?
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.680]   So in order to have a relationship with, with Christ, that they're going to somehow become
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.480]   a kingdom of priests, the whole nation.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.240]   So like, why would they be bringing money and offering to the nation of Israel?
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.480]   Okay.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.400]   It doesn't, it doesn't spell it out, but it seems like because they're functioning as
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.800]   priests, they're paying their tithes and offering to the nation of Israel during this period.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   Okay.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   Yes.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   Okay.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   Not one nod.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.640]   You guys are hot.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.240]   How many of you guys understand what I'm talking about?
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.000]   All right.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   That's enough.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.600]   I'm satisfied with that.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   All right.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   For now.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   Okay.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.480]   Those of you guys who don't understand, just, just file it away in your head.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   Okay.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.440]   It may not, it may not, you may not understand what I'm talking about now, but as you grow
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.480]   in understanding of scripture, you're going to find out that that's a huge part of, of
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.120]   understanding how this, how the scripture and God's prophecy is being fulfilled.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.360]   Okay.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:48.040]   It may not, it may not affect, you know, evangelism today, but it will definitely affect your
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.520]   whole understanding of scripture at some point.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   So just kind of file that away.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   Millennial kingdom.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   Okay.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   Just file it away somewhere.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   Okay.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.600]   So those who previously persecuted Israel will have a different heart and mind in millennial
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   kingdom.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.080]   They will come bowing to Israel.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.120]   Right.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   Who would that be?
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:19.560]   Just take a quick guess.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   Who are the enemies of Israel?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.360]   Don't think theologically, just think like if you weren't in church and I asked you,
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.680]   who are the enemies of Israel?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.160]   What would you answer?
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.840]   Everyone on their border, which is all the Muslim countries right now.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   Okay.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.320]   Now does the Bible say that some Muslims?
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   No.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.760]   But if you think about it, think about the hatred, the, you know, they, Iran, basically
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.760]   their leader said that they're not going to be happy until they drive all the Israelites
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.280]   into the ocean and drown all of them.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.240]   So if they had, if they had access to nuclear bomb, first thing that they would do is just
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240]   bomb Israel.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.240]   Right.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.360]   And then they're going to bomb America for getting in the way.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   So think about that.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.080]   If this, again, you know, we may be reading into this, but if this prophecy is going to
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.560]   be fulfilled, that there's going to come a time that all those people who are trying
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.680]   to kill Israel are going to come and bow down to Israel.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.200]   Isn't that crazy to think that one day in the millennial kingdom, you know what I mean?
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.440]   They all, they think about, I don't know any other nation that has as many enemies
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.320]   as Israel does, at least today.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   Right.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.120]   And to think that when the glory of the Lord comes back on the nation of Israel and there
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.480]   is a massive revival that comes to the nation of Israel and they repent and come to Christ
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.000]   and Israel is restored as God's people that during this period, that all these enemies
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   are going to be bound down.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.520]   They're going to actually be money to Israel.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.880]   Right.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:06.400]   And then he said, those who don't, they will be punished.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:13.920]   You know, nation of Israel disappeared in 80, 70, the zealots came and they attacked
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.360]   the Roman government and the Israel, the Romans just got sick and tired of that and said,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.440]   we're going to come in and we'll wipe them out.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.560]   So Israel as a nation disappeared in 80, 70.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   Right.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   When did they come back?
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.200]   It's like 47 or something, right?
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.480]   I think it's 1947 or 48, somewhere during that period, they were given that land back
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.240]   and Israel actually comes back and then, and then they return.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.760]   So here's a nation that disappears for almost 2000 years.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.040]   Right.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.120]   And they're able to retain their culture.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.040]   And so up to that point, like imagine if you thousand years, like, you know, after Israel
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.280]   disappears and you're talking about like, Oh, one day Israel is going to come back.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.240]   Like it would have been, it would have been fantasy.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.280]   So there's a reason why in church history, there wasn't a lot of emphasis on this.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.560]   It's like, Oh, they're done.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.040]   You know, like a nation that's been gone for a thousand years, they don't just come back.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.880]   I know God is a sovereign God, you know, and we know that he created the universe, but
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.720]   come on, you know, a nation that's dead, the language is dead, you know, are scattered
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.600]   and just hidden all throughout the world.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.320]   All of a sudden, just going to come back.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   It took the Holocaust.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.320]   Right.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.960]   If it wasn't the Holocaust, this would have never happened.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.560]   It's because of the Holocaust, as a result of the suffering of the nation of Israel,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.200]   they're given this piece of land, right.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.800]   By the allies, like the, I think it was a colony of, of, of great Britain and they,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.080]   they decided to give it back.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.880]   And that's why there's all this tension because during that period, the Palestinians were
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.760]   occupying that space and then they just gave it to them.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.880]   So they've been resenting them since.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880]   Right.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.280]   That's crazy to think, you know, now we're on this side of the fulfillment, at least
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.760]   that particular part of prophecy is not only does the Bible say it, I mean, it's, it seems
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.760]   very tangible.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:09.040]   You know, if God can take a nation that disappeared for 2000 years and all of a sudden reappear,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.520]   why would it be so difficult to imagine this?
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.480]   Right.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:25.600]   That'd be crazy.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.800]   He says in this millennial kingdom, there's going to be no violence.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.600]   Lord's glory will replace the need for sun and the moon, meaning that His glory is going
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:43.400]   to be that evident.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.480]   The days of mourning will end.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.720]   The righteousness, according to verse 21 is going to be permanent.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.160]   Again, the only reason why it's permanent is because this was righteousness that is
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.720]   imputed to us by Christ.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.960]   So this is not something that Satan can ever take away.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.400]   So it's going to be permanent.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.640]   The least shall become great and smallest will become the mighty nation.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:26.520]   And this is all going to happen because God's glory is going to return to Israel.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.780]   And isn't that ultimately what salvation is?
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.200]   Salvation is seeing the glory of Christ.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   Right.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.120]   We open our eyes to see that, you know, here's the truth of who he is.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.680]   And then that caused us to surrender our life to Christ in repentance.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   Right.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.840]   But we only see in part.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:49.720]   But he says that at the end, his glory is going to be so bright and so evident.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.160]   Not only would the nation of Israel surrender their life, he said, all others who sees God's
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:09.800]   favor upon Israel are going to come and they're going to worship this God because of them.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.940]   So the question, you know, there's much more to it than that.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.600]   But just according to this passage, it says it seems like it's an earthly fulfillment
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:25.720]   because because Israel is distinguished from the rest of the world.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.880]   So if the church replaced Israel, there should be no distinction.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.160]   We're all just one people.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.000]   It doesn't matter if you're Israelites or, you know, whatever country you're coming from,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.280]   because we're all one, the Gentiles and the Jews have become one.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.600]   But if you look at this fulfillment, it's clear that the Gentiles and and Israel are
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.740]   two distinct separate people.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.320]   And there is an elevation of Israel.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.760]   It's not like the Israel Gentiles are all the same, either.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.080]   Israelites are sitting in a higher position.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.120]   Right.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:01.720]   The Gentile nations will come to serve and to submit during this period.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   So how can this be?
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.240]   If this is the if this is heaven, then does this mean if we were to take this and to apply
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.280]   to heaven, it means that Israel is going to be elevated among all and for the rest of
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.120]   eternity, that we're going to be serving the nation of Israel.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.520]   So again, that's why we don't believe that this is not the eternal kingdom.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.720]   Just talking about the millennial period.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.660]   And it's talking about the promised land and the Israelites returning to it.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:37.800]   So why would the nation of Israel, their descendants return back to the land if it's talking about
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.040]   a spiritual kingdom?
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.040]   Why do they need to return?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.120]   Because everywhere they are, you're right, they're going to go into eternity.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.800]   But there's talk about land.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.080]   Along with that, there's a promise of restoration to ruined cities.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.780]   So what Israel lost is going to be restored.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.880]   So all of this sounds like unless you want to spiritualize everything that's being said
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.040]   here and spiritualize everything that's said in the book of Revelation, it seems like God
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:16.200]   has a period reserved where every promise he made to the nation of Israel is going to
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.360]   be fulfilled literally.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.920]   And that's that period.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   Millennial kingdom.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920]   Okay?
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   Just file that away.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:40.280]   >> What are the gentile believers doing at this time?
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.520]   >> Probably what we're doing now.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.920]   It doesn't say it's during a millennial kingdom, it's a literal kingdom.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.280]   So we're probably going to be doing what we're doing now, except that Christ himself is going
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:58.120]   to be literally ruling the earth through the nation of Israel.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.760]   So life is going to go on, but we can't imagine what it would be like when we literally have
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.640]   the king.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.900]   Like Jesus when he walked on earth, but now the people in the world recognize him.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.720]   So there's a period, whether that's a literal thousand years or a period of time when the
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.780]   new heaven and new earth is restored by Christ.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.920]   And so we'll be functioning, but with the true king actually ruling.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:34.480]   >> So during that period, do you feel that you have a past?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   >> You guys can get into this, all right.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Okay.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.080]   All right.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.880]   So let me give you a short answer, okay?
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:54.120]   Because there is no, I've never heard an airtight argument for any of this stuff because there's
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   a lot of questions that come up.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:02.800]   And so that question was asked, in fact, I may have asked that question when I was taking
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.120]   this book of revelation class.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   And the answer that was given, because the Bible doesn't spell this out, but what the
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   Bible does spell out is that there's going to be a binding during, before the thousand
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.640]   year reign of Christ, and then there's going to be a releasing, right?
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.960]   And at the releasing where he's going to be allowed to go and deceive.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.840]   And then there's a white throne judgment that happens at the very end.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:32.760]   So during that period, those people who are born, they're not all Christians.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.160]   So only Christians enter into the millennium, right?
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.000]   But they're not all Christians who are in the millennium.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.840]   So there's a second judgment that is a white throne judgment where the final judgment takes
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.640]   place, right?
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.440]   So the question that comes up is like, how many times is there a resurrection?
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.640]   How many times does Jesus come back in his store kingdom?
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.200]   Yeah, we won't get into that now.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.280]   Okay.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.360]   But I think again, the temptation is because of the complexity of how things are laid out,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   right?
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.920]   Are you a preacher, mid trip, post trip?
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.960]   Are you a millennial, post millennial?
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.480]   You know, you have all these different views of how things will play out.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.960]   And then you have, you know, basically all of that is, all of that is just allegorical
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680]   and just, we're just living at the end time.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.600]   Jesus is going to come in the end.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   Right.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.440]   Personally, the reason why I think that this interpretation and application makes more
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.160]   sense is because think about all the prophecies that they, they mentioned about Jesus in the
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   old Testament.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.400]   Like that kind of like, oh, he's going to be born in a manger in Bethlehem.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.360]   And you know, he's going to be, you know, like think about all the prophecies.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.720]   Born of a virgin, like all of these things, like he's going to be riding on a donkey.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.120]   Jesus fulfilled that literally.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.320]   Right.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.080]   Majority of what he said was fulfilled literally.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.120]   So it doesn't make sense to me that we come and then we take the prophecies that are given
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   now and then spiritualize all of it.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   Right.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.160]   I think the more consistent way, even though it may be difficult, like we won't know, Jesus
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.840]   said you will not know the time or the hour.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:12.000]   So I don't think he gave us the tools to be able to say, you know, what's going to happen
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.080]   here and after 2000 years, this is going to happen after 800 years, this is going to happen.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   He didn't give us that.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.920]   He gave us just enough so that you wouldn't be caught off guard like a thief coming into
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   your house.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.960]   Like you can see the times, the signs of the times and say, oh, I remember Jesus said this,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.800]   that these are, these are things going to happen.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.960]   You know, rumors, wars and rumors of wars and natural disasters, that these things are
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   going to increase.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.440]   The love of God is going to grow cold because of the wickedness of this generation.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.900]   So he has all of these things that are in place.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.460]   And then so that when you see them happening, it causes you to say, could it be now?
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.240]   So you're not being caught off guard.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Right.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.040]   But it just doesn't make sense to me that how everything was fulfilled literally in
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.840]   his first coming and then to just, just discount all of that and say, that's all spiritual
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.520]   in his second coming.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.320]   It seems to be inconsistent to me.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   Right.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.520]   So if we were to take that literally again, all of these things don't, it's not a neat
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.280]   box that we can put it in, but these are just kind of outlines that we see that I think
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:14.600]   that a nation of Israel at some point is going to experience a revival and there's going
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   to be a mass repentance.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.480]   In fact, there's a whole ministry group of people.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.880]   I think they're called chosen chosen people ministry and it's Jewish Christians who are
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.560]   targeting Jews to convert.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.960]   And so there's a whole ministry that targets them.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:36.280]   And then there's been a mass return back to Jerusalem because this movement is going back
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.680]   as ultimately they want to send people back to Jerusalem to bring revival to evangelize
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.320]   in Israel because they believe that this is going to be fulfilled through them.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   Okay.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   All right.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   We can talk more later.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.320]   Right.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.480]   We have too many people where it's going to, it's going over their head.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   Okay.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.280]   So during this period, it's going to, he's going to bind up the brokenhearted, proclaim
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:10.040]   the liberty to the captives, release the prisoners bound and comfort those who mourn.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.920]   Do you think that this description of brokenhearted, those who are in captive, prisoners bound,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.840]   those who mourn, do you think this is a description of a particular group of people?
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:30.600]   Where there's a particular group of people who are brokenhearted, who are captive, who
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   are prisoners, who are bound and certain people who mourn.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:44.680]   Is that like a foreshadowing of a circle on the mountain?
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   Yes, I'm sure that's connected.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.200]   Talking about like people who are seeking after God, they're brokenhearted because they
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   see the sin of God.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   Right.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   When I look at this, this is not just a description of some people who, you know, who lost their
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.280]   jobs or lost a loved one and, you know, had some financial problems.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.080]   This is a description of every single human being who's living in this fallen world.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   Right.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.040]   Every single human being that's living in this fallen world to a certain degree, experience
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.640]   all of this, whether it's literal or spiritual.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:27.560]   So when he says that he came to set the captives free, are there people who are captive and
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.080]   not captive?
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.480]   No.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.900]   Every single human being.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.560]   So this is a description of all of us to a certain degree.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.640]   Right.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.120]   Anybody who is under the influence of the reign of sin, which is all mankind, experiences
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.480]   brokenheartedness, right?
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.240]   Captivity, being bound and mourned all because of sin.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.880]   And this is what all of these things are a direct result of sin.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.040]   And he said basically he's going to lift the sin.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.720]   And then when the sin is lifted and he's able to draw near and his glory comes back, right?
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.360]   All of these things are going to be taken care of.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   And yes, the sermon of the mount, you know, the attitude is an exact description that
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.400]   all of these things are going to be reversed when we repent and we come to God.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.640]   So what we're experiencing now is only a glimpse, but in the millennial kingdom and in eternity,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.440]   all of that is going to be in full force.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.860]   Right?
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.400]   What is promised to the people of God?
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.080]   They shall build up cities that were ruined because God's judgment on on them.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.400]   Verse four.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.000]   They will be honored and even served by other nation.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.880]   Again, this is all things that was said in the previous chapter, but he repeats it again.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:35:00.240]   So in other words, Israel is going to be restored and then nations will come to them to ultimately
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.040]   come to God.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.160]   And they're going to be given double portion instead of dishonor.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.900]   In other words, they're going to be separated.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.760]   They're not going to be like all the other nations.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.620]   The Israel is not just restored back to the other, you know, where the other nations are.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.040]   They're going to be lifted above that.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.840]   They're going to be receiving the double honor.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.960]   So again, this is part of the reason why I believe that this is in reference to a literal
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:38.680]   Israel.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.720]   What God considers justice here is contrasted with false worship.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:48.160]   So look, look at first.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.760]   Verse eight, he says, for I, the Lord love justice.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.840]   I hate robbery and wrong.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   Right.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.360]   How many have ESV?
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.240]   How many have NASB?
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.600]   How many of you have New King James or King James?
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.280]   OK, one.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.760]   All right.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.000]   So in the NASB, can you read that passage in NASB?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.320]   Those of you have NASB.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.240]   Read the beginning of verse eight.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.720]   Anybody?
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:25.880]   OK, did you guys catch that?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.520]   What was different in the ESV?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.040]   It says, for I, the Lord love justice.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.040]   I hate robbery and wrong.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.000]   And what does the NASB say?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Burnt offering.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Completely different.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Not even close.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Right.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.320]   The reason why there's a different translation on those those words is because there is a,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.120]   I think I think they call it a conjunction that is missing in one of the manuscripts.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.160]   And so when you add that, it becomes burnt offering.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.960]   When you don't add that, it becomes something, something wrong.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   Right.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.640]   And so that's why the NASB and the New King James has translated burnt offering.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.440]   But it would either way, if you look at it in the context of what God is telling the
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:18.160]   nation of Israel, what was the primary sin during this period?
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   False worship.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.800]   They're very active at the temple.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   Right.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.760]   In fact, it doesn't say in Malachi that you have robbed me.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.760]   Is that how do we rob you?
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.360]   Rob me of of tithes and offering.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Right.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.560]   So when he says here, it says, for I, the Lord love justice.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.000]   I hate robbery.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.040]   Right.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.000]   And what's wrong and what was wrong.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Right.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.400]   It was the way that they were worshiping.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.680]   And that's why the next passage says, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   Right.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.480]   And they establish the truth.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.640]   I will direct them, direct their work in truth and establish an everlasting kingdom covenant.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.520]   In other words, your worship is going to be genuine.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   That's just it's not going to be just going through the motion when he comes and he restores
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.320]   true worship is going to be restored along with it.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   And who is he in reference to at the end that that breaks out in worship?
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.880]   Probably the converted Jews at the end, the recipients.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.360]   And so when they see the Lord's glory being restored, it says, I will greatly rejoice
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   in the Lord.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:28.520]   My soul shall exalt in my God, for he has clothed me with garments of salvation.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.520]   Amen.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:39.520]   Amen.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.680]   (splash)
