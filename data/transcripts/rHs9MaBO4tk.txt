[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.300]  ,
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:25:08.100]   All right.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.180]   Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.100]   Hello, hello.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:16.420]   Testing, testing.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.260]   One, two, three, four.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.460]   Ah, ah.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.900]   All right, well, hello, everybody.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.300]   I'm glad you guys are here.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.580]   This week was a little bit easier to prepare
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.660]   just in terms of the length,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.120]   but it was still pretty dense, I assume, right?
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.500]   Just so that we don't lose the context
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.260]   of what we've been covering,
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.020]   we're gonna start with last week's passage moving forward,
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.700]   starting from verse 12, so let me read this,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.500]   and then I'll show you what some of the questions
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.260]   we're gonna be discussing are,
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.860]   and then we'll break up into our time of discussion.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.020]   In coming to him as to a living stone,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.180]   which has been rejected by men,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.780]   but is choice and precious in the sight of God,
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.620]   you also as living stones are being built up
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.420]   as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.520]   to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.460]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.660]   For this is contained in scripture,
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.460]   behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone,
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.700]   a precious cornerstone,
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.780]   and he who believes in him will not be disappointed.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.100]   This precious value then is for you who believe,
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.060]   for those who disbelieve,
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.900]   the stone which the builders rejected,
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.780]   this became the very cornerstone,
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.260]   and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.580]   for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.020]   and to this doom they were also appointed.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.780]   But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.560]   a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.740]   so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.420]   who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.620]   For you once were not a people,
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.140]   but now you are the people of God.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.020]   You had not received mercy,
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.100]   but now you have received mercy.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.180]   Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.980]   to abstain from fleshly lusts
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.340]   which wage war against the soul.
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.460]   Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles,
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.100]   so that in the thing which they slander you as evildoers,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.500]   they may because of your good deeds as they observe them.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.580]   Glorify God in the day of visitation, amen.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.260]   So there's a lot of Old Testament text
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.860]   in the passage from last week and then today as well.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.640]   And the first two questions are pretty standard,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.780]   just discuss what you've observed.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.860]   But question number three, when you guys do have time,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.940]   please discuss who are the people of God
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.360]   and what is their purpose?
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.060]   If you did your study,
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.660]   you probably will know why this question is being asked.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.480]   Okay, who are the people of God and what's their purpose?
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.940]   And then four, a little bit more applicational,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.860]   what does it mean for a Christian to be living on Earth
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.600]   as an alien and a stranger?
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.220]   So right now it's 719 at 820.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.980]   We'll reconvene and we'll go into our teaching portion.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.340]   So let me pray for us
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.440]   and then we'll dismiss into our discussion time.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.160]   Father, we're thankful that we are here tonight.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.820]   Lord God, I pray that this study tonight
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.660]   will not just be an academic theological exercise,
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.260]   but it will be transformative,
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.700]   that it would cause us once again to be humbled,
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.220]   to marvel, to be thankful,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.020]   and all of that would stir within us a great motivation
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.380]   really to pursue holiness
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.320]   and to shine the light of Christ into this dark world.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.140]   Help our discussion not to be contentious.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.860]   Help it not to be a time
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.780]   where we show off what we've learned,
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.000]   but help it to be really an edifying time
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.140]   where all of us are moved first and foremost toward worship,

[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.740]   because we fed well on your word.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.780]   So we pray for your help.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.940]   Would you guard, guide, and lead our time?
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.340]   And pray this in Jesus' name.

[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.500]   (congregation chattering)

[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:02.500]   (congregation laughing)
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:17.500]   (congregation laughing)

[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:24.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.000]   (congregation chattering)

[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:50.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:07.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:16.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:25.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:42.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:51.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:59.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:08.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:17.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.500]   (congregation chattering)
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.000]   (congregation chattering)
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.500]   - All right, if you guys can turn your attention,
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.500]   appear real quick.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.000]   Let me pray for us,
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.500]   and then we'll get into today's passage.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:22.500]   Father, as we spend some time
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:28.000]   just having a wrap-up of what we're looking at today,
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.500]   I pray that you would help us not to get lost
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.500]   in scrutinizing all the details,
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.500]   but rather that you would help us
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.000]   to just marvel in glory
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.500]   in just the whole of this passage.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.500]   And so would you help me explain
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.500]   what I need to explain clearly?
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.500]   And would you leave an indelible impression
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.500]   on all of our hearts through your word
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.500]   that we would leave here fed and changed?
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:22.500]   All right, so our passage,
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.500]   what are the first two words in our passage today
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.000]   that abut you, right?
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   So because of this but you,
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   I had to include last week's passage into my outline,
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   because we're looking at the Jews,
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   especially the Jewish religious leaders,
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   rejected this Messiah, right?
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   So because these Jews rejected the Messiah,
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.500]   they were appointed to stumbling,
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.000]   and they're stumbling, but I'm contrasted,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.500]   or this person, the reader is contrasted
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.000]   with this, what just came before.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.500]   So I include that in there.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:07.500]   And if you guys notice from the middle,
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.500]   the but you are,
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:14.000]   and then just so that I can visually follow
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   that whole column of a chosen race,
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.500]   it's just all the descriptions
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:22.500]   of who a people of God is, okay?
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:27.000]   So this is just a key for you.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.500]   For the first week,
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.000]   so that C and the D up in the corner,
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   the very first week I gave you an outline
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   of kind of what I do when I track through
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.500]   the 105 verses of 1 Peter.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.000]   So the teal blue,
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.500]   there is an emphasis on the return of Christ.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.000]   So that's just left there.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.500]   The green, there was an emphasis on the call
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.000]   and the purpose of the Christian,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   and so the being built as a spiritual house
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.500]   for a holy priesthood and being aliens
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.000]   and strangers, that's kind of part of the call.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   So I just left it at that.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.500]   And because of this contrast,
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:08.000]   I just highlighted in gray all the non-people of God.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.500]   The non-people of God, that's not even a word,
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.000]   but I'm just gonna call them non-people of God
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   because I don't know if they're Gentiles,
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.500]   or if they're like Jewish folk who rejected.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.500]   Regardless, I'm just putting non-people of God,
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.000]   and I'm highlighting that in the gray.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.500]   And you see the for they, for you, your former self,
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.500]   and then the Gentiles and they,
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.000]   so I just highlighted that.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]   And then as I'm going through this,
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   I highlight in the red all the very important words.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   And I notice that there are two so that's there.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.500]   And you don't have to do it this way,
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.000]   but when I look at that, I'm like,
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.500]   the so that usually is telling me to do something,
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500]   or there's like a purpose behind it.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.000]   So I pull that all the way to the side.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.500]   'Cause I feel like in my mind, in my reading,
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.000]   at this juncture, that's a very important point
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.500]   that I need to see, okay?
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.000]   So the so that's get pulled,
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.500]   and then I notice the thing that comes after it
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.000]   is exactly the same in the purple.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.500]   Nod your head if you see that.
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:14.500]   Proclaim the excellencies of God,
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:19.500]   so that they may glorify God.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500]   So the point is,
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:26.500]   the glory of God, the praise of God,
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.000]   the magnification of God, that's the point.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.500]   So I don't wanna lose sight of that
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500]   when I'm trying to figure out who are the people of God.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.000]   The Hosea 1 passage, what's it saying?
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000]   Ezekiel 37, what's it saying?
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.500]   I'm gonna get lost in that,
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:42.000]   but this actually helps me kinda be tethered to,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.500]   okay, the point is,
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:47.500]   God is ordaining things for his glory,
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.000]   and he's always been doing this for his praise.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.500]   So my eyes are now fixed on this,
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.500]   and I'm not gonna drift too far from that, all right?
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:02.000]   Now, one thing you might notice in your,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.500]   when you're looking at all the quotations
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.000]   of the Old Testament in 1 Peter,
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.500]   and you do a cross-reference,
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500]   and you look at the Old Testament passage,
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:14.500]   you notice that sometimes the wording is different, right?
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:18.500]   So just in the event you guys might be wondering what that is,
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.500]   is the New Testament writers
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.500]   did not have the Hebrew Bible with them.
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:29.500]   Our Old Testament is translated from the Hebrew.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.500]   You guys following that?
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.500]   Their Bible, which they quoted,
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:39.000]   was translated from the Greek, okay?
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.500]   'Cause at that time, how many of you guys
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:46.000]   are non-American ethnically, racially?
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   Yeah, I'm completely yellow.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   I'm Korean, right?
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   I don't wanna read the Korean Bible.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.500]   And you backtrack me even more,
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.500]   I don't wanna read the Chinese Bible,
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.500]   'cause the Korean language,
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.500]   so my first Bible had a bunch of Chinese in it,
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:05.500]   and I was like, this isn't even Korean.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:10.000]   So the people of God at this time,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.500]   they spoke Greek, they read Greek,
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.000]   and so that's why they needed a Bible
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   that they could, the Old Testament,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.500]   that they could read in the Greek.
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.000]   And so that's called the Septuagint,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   and oftentimes if you look at a commentary,
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000]   it'll say LXX, and it's Latin for 70.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.500]   Supposedly, reportedly, 70 scholars of their day
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.000]   translated the Hebrew into the Greek, okay?
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000]   So the Septuagint is the earliest Greek translation
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   of the Old Testament,
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.500]   and this was like 3rd century BC,
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.500]   so the original people who wanted this translation
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:50.500]   were Greeks living in Egypt, all right?
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.500]   So they had this as their Bible,
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.000]   and then it got passed down.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   So you'll notice some differences
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   when you look at the translation.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   It'd be like, "Wait, they translated it wrong."
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   No, so even Jesus' quotes sometimes
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.500]   of the Old Testament,
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.000]   the wording may be a little bit different
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   because our Old Testament is translated from the Hebrew.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.500]   Their Old Testament was translated from the Greek.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.500]   Make sense?
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:16.500]   So I'll just read 1 Peter 2.6,
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.000]   being quoted out of Isaiah 28.16.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   "a tested stone, a costly cornerstone,
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.500]   "for the foundation firmly placed.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.500]   "He who believes in it will not be disturbed."
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.000]   This is from last week.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.500]   But the 1 Peter quotes it,
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500]   "Behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone,
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:36.500]   "a precious cornerstone,
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:40.500]   "and he who believes in him will not be disappointed."
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.500]   Different or the same?
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.000]   Slightly different, okay?
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   So just in the event that that's annoying you,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   now you know, okay?
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000]   So an important question for me is,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.500]   who are the people of God in this passage?
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:01.500]   So I'm actually gonna look up these quotes
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:04.000]   and find them, and so for my eyes--
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.500]   Oops, sorry, I'm not on the--
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.500]   So for my eyes, I wanna understand the context
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:15.000]   in which these original people were writing.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.500]   So Isaiah 43 is talking about the chosen race.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.500]   How many guys got tripped up on the chosen race,
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.500]   chosen family?
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.000]   They all mean a little different things, right?
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   Chosen generations.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.500]   The Holy Nation royal priesthood
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:32.500]   had promises attached to it.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:35.000]   Exodus 19, five and six,
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.500]   also repeated in chapter 23.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.000]   There are promises attached to it,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000]   so what's the context?
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   So did these people break the covenant
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.500]   and get rejected completely?
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.500]   So all of these kinds of contexts,
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.000]   I want my eyes to see,
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.500]   so I will make a chart on the side of my 1 Peter passage
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:02.500]   so that I can see the surrounding verses
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.000]   around the verses that he quotes to help me, okay?
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.500]   And if I have time, I will dig and dig and dig,
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.000]   go off on a rabbit trail,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.500]   and start looking into all the historical contexts
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.000]   of the Old Testament.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.500]   If I had time, I would do that, okay?
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:20.000]   So I'm not gonna go into all of these things with this,
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.500]   but this is the process by which I try to come
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:27.000]   to the conclusion, who are the people of God?
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   Now, so this is a question.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.500]   Who are the people of God?
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:39.000]   In the Old Testament, the people of God
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.500]   were the nation of Israel, beloved and chosen of God.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500]   That's not hard, right?
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:49.000]   That's an easy truth to come to.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   If you guys are wondering why, for most of the Old Testament,
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   they're not called the Jews.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   Do you guys ever think that?
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   Like, what's going on?
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.500]   Way later, when they were exiled, they had no land.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:10.500]   They were from a land formerly known as Judah.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:15.000]   So they had to call this displaced people of Judah,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.500]   Uden, right?
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.000]   And eventually, they started getting called the Jews,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.500]   and you see that mentioned often in the book of Esther.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500]   You won't see it as mentioned often
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.500]   in, like, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, all right?
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.500]   So the word "Jews" is a signifier of, like,
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:36.500]   that's where--that's the region they were once from, okay?
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:43.500]   So the Judeans, the Jews, in the New Testament,
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:48.000]   from our vantage point, who are the people of God?
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.500]   It's all people who put their faith and trust
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:55.500]   solely on the work of Jesus Christ.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.000]   Amen?
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.500]   Race doesn't matter, right?
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:05.500]   Whether you're Vietnamese or Chinese or Tanzanian or Indian,
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:09.000]   if you put your faith in Christ or Jew,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   you are a people of God.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000]   The people of God are also often called the household of God,
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]   the church of the living God.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.500]   And you'll realize that Galatians 3 says
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:31.000]   the Holy Spirit gave Abraham the gospel in advance, okay?
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.500]   So those who received the Spirit of God
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.500]   are all people of God.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.500]   So I get that, okay?
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:42.000]   Old Testament people of God were specifically
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   of the Hebrew race, the nation of Israel, Jews.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.500]   New Testament, it's kind of like a--I want to say jjamppong.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.000]   That's Korean for, like, a big mixed food.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.500]   It's like a mixed noodle, all right?
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.000]   Jjamppong.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.500]   So it's a--like, who are these people?
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.500]   What unifies them?
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.500]   It's faith in Christ.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:09.500]   So then an important question that arises from that
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:18.000]   is, then has the church replaced the nation of Israel
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000]   as the people of God?
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.500]   Because if I just--at bird's eye view,
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:29.000]   1 Peter 2, verses 4, the earlier parts,
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.500]   it seemed like they had their chance,
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:33.500]   they broke their covenant, and now they stumbled.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:36.500]   The NASB actually calls it to their doom, right?
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.500]   And God appointed this.
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:43.000]   So they're done.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000]   So then has the church replaced the nation of Israel
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000]   as the people of God?
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000]   I would say absolutely not.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]   Okay, now this is going to throw a lot of you guys
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]   who are more theologically astute,
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.500]   and what's the--then how do you see the role
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.500]   of the nation of Israel,
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.500]   and are they the people of--
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:11.000]   like, so what's happening here?
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000]   So the whole of Scripture will say,
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000]   no, the church has not replaced Israel
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.500]   as a people of God.
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:27.000]   The promises that are given to the nation of Israel,
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000]   the people of Israel, are still valid.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.500]   Okay, now, this slide is maybe familiar,
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:44.000]   and I bring this up for a reason, all right?
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000]   Exegesis, we talked about this in Titus,
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000]   it's the process of drawing out the meaning
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]   from the Scripture in accordance with the context
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000]   and discoveral meaning of its author.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000]   That's what we want to do.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000]   We want to see--that's why we're doing inductive study.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]   We want to see what God has to say.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]   We want to be as accurate to what God has to say.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   Exegesis is, I am going to impose my opinion,
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   my interpretation, onto the text.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000]   So when you're trying to come up with--
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000]   and here's a fancy word, eschatology.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000]   When you're trying to figure out
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000]   what happens in the end times,
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000]   what are all the things in the book of Revelation,
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   what are they symbolizing?
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]   Are we supposed to read it literally?
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]   Are we supposed to read it figuratively?
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   When you're thinking through all of these things,
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000]   you have to be careful not to eisegi.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]   You don't want to already have a decision made in your heart.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   I am a person who believes that the church has replaced Israel
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   and place that paradigm onto the text
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000]   and read every paradigm from that point on
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000]   or every word from those lenses.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000]   What we want to do is see what the whole of Scripture
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000]   has to say about the future,
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000]   what the whole of Scripture has to say
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000]   about the role of Israel in the future.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]   And until I have a firm grasp of the whole of Scripture,
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]   I will be humble and not dogmatic
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]   about whatever position I take.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   Are you guys following this?
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]   Okay.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.000]   So we don't want to eisegit and place our framework
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]   and our paradigm onto a text.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000]   We want to see what the whole of it has to say to us.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]   And I believe that the whole of Scripture has to say
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000]   that God is not done with the nation of Israel
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000]   from where we stand.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]   You guys following this?
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000]   Okay.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000]   And I'll leave it at that.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]   So then who are these Gentiles?
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000]   1 Peter 4, 3 mentions them again.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   "For the time already past is sufficient for you
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000]   to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles,"
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000]   and we just looked at the fleshly lust stuff, right?
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000]   "having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness,
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:09.000]   carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries."
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000]   So literally, the word "Gentile" means the nations
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]   or the unsaved world.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000]   Okay, that's how the New Testament uses the word "ethnos."
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000]   So from a simple reading, you'll have to conclude
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000]   these are all who are not Christians,
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:31.000]   both literal Jews and literal Gentiles.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   You guys following?
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000]   Okay, so this is an important question
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000]   because it's like they're going to be giving glory to God.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   What does that mean?
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000]   Okay.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000]   So I'm going to read verse 12 for you one more time.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000]   so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers,
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000]   they may because of your good deeds as they observe them
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   glorify God in the day of visitation."
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000]   So I have all kinds of inductive questions.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]   What is the day of visitation?
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000]   And to understand it as, they're getting judged.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]   "You are righteous. Every knee has bowed.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]   You are righteous."
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   I don't think that's what it's saying here.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000]   In fact, the Gentiles, even at the end of times,
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]   can refuse to give him glory,
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:11.000]   as you'll see here in Revelation 16, 8-9.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000]   So for me, when I read this passage,
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:21.000]   I am keeping my conduct so good among the Gentiles
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000]   that they're accusing me of stuff.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.000]   But as my good conduct is representative
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]   of Christ's work in my life,
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000]   and as that power exudes through me,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   I read this as, "This Gentile may come to faith."
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000]   1 Peter 3 says something very similar about wives.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000]   "In the same way, you wives, be subject to your own husbands,
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]   so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000]   they may be," what?
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]   "One over."
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]   So I'm looking at this as,
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]   just as it was so absurd for God to bring Gentiles
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000]   into the people of God,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000]   just as it was unthinkable for God to bring these pagan,
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000]   heathen, worthless people, uncircumcised,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000]   barbarian Gentiles into this royal priesthood,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]   what we think of as unthinkable,
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]   of bringing that pagan, that dirty,
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000]   like non-Christian, foul-mouthed person,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:37.000]   by my conduct, I can win them over to the faith
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:44.000]   in God's time and way, if he so chooses.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000]   So I, myself, should not get in the way
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000]   of the ministry of reconciliation to the best of my ability.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]   Are you guys following this?
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   So I don't read this as,
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]   the Gentiles are going to also bow their knee.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]   There is a passage there, but not this one.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:09.000]   I read this as, you are enabled
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   to win some over to the faith.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000]   That's how I'd read that, just grammatically,
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]   and just from understanding the passage.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000]   Now, here was a point that was brought up
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000]   in our discussion.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]   An alien and a stranger exile sojourner,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000]   are they comfortable or are they uncomfortable?
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]   Super uncomfortable.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]   I mean, in America, it's a little bit different,
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000]   but even in America, super uncomfortable.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000]   Should a Christian ever feel at home
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000]   and super comfortable in this place?
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   No.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000]   So if a Christian, or if an alien and a stranger
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000]   is uncomfortable, like,
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]   he kind of should be used to that.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000]   It's a given, right?
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000]   So this passage reminds me of,
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000]   I've been an alien and a sojourner,
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000]   and an, not an exile, but alien and a sojourner often.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]   So for you guys who don't know what I used to do in Korea,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]   I used to be on 70 flights a year,
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000]   outside of Korea, 100 days a year,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000]   traveling, taking people into the slums
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]   in different countries in the world.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000]   So I've been at very nice hotels,
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000]   where like, I open up my balcony and there's a pool.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000]   I could jump into the pool from my bed.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]   So, super nice.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   But more often than not,
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000]   I've been at very uncomfortable ones.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]   I've actually slept in Indonesia on a bed
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000]   where, like, right next to my leg,
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:52.000]   a centipede walked past me.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000]   I screamed.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000]   There was, in that same hotel room,
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000]   I was so annoyed because the first four days
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]   I showered in cold water because
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000]   I didn't know that you had to turn it the other way for the hot.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000]   They had red for cold, blue for hot.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]   I was so mad.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000]   I've been in hotels, all temporary,
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000]   that my ears were bothered by.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]   Ecuador, there were alpacas outside my room
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]   making alpacan noises.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]   (Alpaca noises)
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000]   Sounds like turkey dogs, okay?
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000]   I was on the 18th floor in India
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000]   where there are monkeys right outside my window
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000]   slapping each other angry.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000]   I am not happy there because I'm already jet lagged.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]   I have to lead 20, 30 people on a trip
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000]   and I'm not sleeping good.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000]   North Korea, the hotel that we were staying at,
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000]   whatever it is, they put tigers on the curtain.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000]   Like, you know those Asian drawings?
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000]   I'm like, what is this?
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]   I am not impressed with your country because of this tiger curtain.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000]   I don't care how ferocious it looks.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]   There were times where I actually had,
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000]   in Uganda, where I had a, my hotel room was nice and clean
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000]   except I had to use a squatter.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]   Not pleasant, right?
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]   So, all of those places where I'm an alien and a stranger,
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000]   I'm not thinking to change the curtains up.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000]   I'm not thinking to make any radical moves.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]   I know that I'm supposed to be uncomfortable
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000]   because this is not my home.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]   But it's temporary.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000]   Like, I'm passing through. This will end. I'm gonna go.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]   But Compassion International, I'm wearing,
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]   well, this was not deliberate,
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000]   but Compassion International is a blatantly Christian organization.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000]   So, whenever I would take the 20, 30 people
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000]   into the countries and we would stay at the hotel,
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]   I would actually tell them, and sometimes it was true,
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]   sometimes it was not, I would say,
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000]   "Koreans are hated in this country."
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000]   Sometimes it was true, okay?
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000]   But I was like, "Koreans are hated in this country?
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000]   "So, let's do our best to represent not just Korea,
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]   "but Compassion International well.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000]   "I encourage you guys, leave generous tips."
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]   Because, first of all, the people who are working here
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]   are like the parents of the children
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]   that you're gonna meet in the slums.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]   So, this is extra income for them.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]   They're working for it.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]   If something gets misplaced or stolen,
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000]   just be okay with it.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000]   And just pray for their salvation, pray for their help,
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]   that maybe they need it more than you.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000]   And everywhere you go, complain to me.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000]   Don't complain to the employees in the hotel.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000]   So that we could leave a good experience of a Korean group,
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]   especially a Korean Christian group,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000]   in the sight of the hotel employees.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000]   And I would emphasize that everywhere.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.000]   I don't know what that did for, like, the image of the Korean.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000]   Because a lot of times, in the Philippines especially,
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]   the sex trafficking industry is pretty bad.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]   So a lot of times, middle-aged Korean men
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000]   would come on golf trips and sex tourism.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000]   And they would stay at these hotels.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   But we're there too.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000]   I was like, "Let us leave a good impression."
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.000]   Perhaps to change their mind of what Korean Christians are like.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.000]   Because the world sees Korea as a Christian nation.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000]   Which I don't think it is.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000]   So, when I think of this passage, that's what I think of.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]   I'm an alien and a stranger.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]   Suffering, given.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]   Uncomfortable, that's a given.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]   Just annoyance, it's a given.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]   Things that I don't like, it's a given.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000]   I'm not going to be in a rush to change the curtains in a hotel
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]   that I'm leaving tomorrow.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000]   My goal there is to represent compassion well.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   My goal there is to represent Koreans well.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000]   Do you guys follow?
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]   Do you guys understand this?
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.000]   All of the suffering that we go through is temporary.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]   But the world does not have an answer for joy in the midst of suffering.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000]   And so, we're going to be starting to move in that direction in this passage.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000]   All right?
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000]   So, next week, it's eight verses again.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]   I heard some groaning.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]   Uncomfortable.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000]   Hopefully, this is a very helpful exercise.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000]   Thirteen to 20, it's going to be talking about two groups.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000]   Okay?
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000]   So, go over that.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000]   Question five is what does it mean to be subject?
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]   Because that comes out a couple times.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000]   All right?
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]   What does it mean to be subject?
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000]   And I'm going to post this on Facebook, so you don't need to scramble to write.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:00.000]   For today's discussion, I actually would encourage you guys with this little exercise,
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:10.000]   what three words would the Gentiles nearest and dearest to you use in describing your life?
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000]   And would you say that these words are accurate or slanderous?
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000]   Peter's lazy.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:24.000]   If it's accurate, I need to change some stuff in the midst of my Gentiles.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:34.000]   Peter is self-righteous, Bible-thumping, like just hard, evangelical, conservative pastor.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000]   Okay, I just don't like those labels.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000]   Some of it is very derogatory and slanderous.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000]   I can't do anything about that.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]   If they call me fat and lazy, okay.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]   And if that's true, I got to change it.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:53.000]   So, the Gentiles in your life, what would they describe you as?
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000]   And then the second and third questions are similar.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:05.000]   How can your small group members pray for you as you, one, fight to abstain from fleshly lusts?
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000]   Some of it's like the desire to complain that the curtains are ugly.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]   Okay.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000]   Three, how can your small group members pray for you as you witness
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000]   and minister to specific Gentiles around you?
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000]   And you guys understand where I'm getting these questions from, right, from our passage.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000]   So, let me pray for us, and then we'll dismiss into our time of sharing.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000]   Lord, help us to be honest.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000]   Help us to be humble.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:37.000]   Help us not to be overly in despair.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:44.000]   Lord, but to remember, Lord, that you love us.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000]   And you did not come because we were lovable, but you came because we were helpless,
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000]   because that's the kind of God you are.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:57.000]   So, as we reflect on your goodness and as we reflect on our frailty,
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000]   I pray for your help to apply appropriately.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000]   And, Lord, I pray that you would help us to be vulnerable with each other
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000]   and ask for help so that we can grow.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   And as we grow, so that you will receive the glory that you do in our lives.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000]   We thank you and we love you, Lord.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000]   Amen.
