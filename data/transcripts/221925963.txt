[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to come and study your Word.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.000]   We pray that you will give us insight, that your Word would truly judge the thoughts and
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.520]   intentions of our heart.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.400]   Help us, Lord God, to seek you, to know you, and that we may profess our love to you with
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.280]   sincerity of heart.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.080]   We ask, Lord God, that you would give us soberness as we study your Word.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.000]   All right, so we're in Revelations chapter 6.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.600]   We're getting into the obscure part of Revelation.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   And I think I mentioned this before, but let me reiterate.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.160]   I didn't want to give you a box and say, "Hey, we're looking at a pre-tribulation, you know,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.480]   pre-millennial view, so every passage that we look at, and I'm going to tell you exactly
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440]   when this is going to happen and how this is going to happen."
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.760]   Because if I did that, you would end up coming out of the Bible with whatever view I give
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.080]   you.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.120]   And I don't want you to be studying the book of Revelation like that, so I want you to
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.360]   be questioning and asking yourself the same questions that I'm asking.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.680]   When is this going to take place?
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.660]   How is this going to take place?
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.520]   Has this already taken place?
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.600]   So I want you guys to be asking those critical questions as we're studying, instead of me
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960]   telling you, "Hey, this didn't take place," or, "This has already taken place."
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.760]   Obviously, I have my views.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760]   It doesn't mean that I'm not going to mention it at all.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.440]   I am going to mention it, but I'm not going to have every single passage that we're looking
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.120]   at and give you one particular view, okay?
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.640]   So I can't help but to influence you a certain way because I'm the one teaching, and I'm
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.440]   going to have certain views that I lean toward.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.360]   But again, as you're studying it, I want you guys to be asking the same question.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.520]   Has this taken place?
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.120]   Is this allegorical?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.600]   Was this meant to be taken literally?
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.280]   And to think critically, right?
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.800]   So that if some part of it doesn't make sense, that you don't just hear what I say and say,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   "Oh, okay, that's what he said, so that's what it must be."
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.360]   So I don't want you to be studying it that way.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.520]   For chapter six all the way to chapter 16, there's three different judgments, three sets
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760]   of seven judgments, okay?
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760]   Remember the three?
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.040]   Obviously, you know the first one.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   We studied.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.560]   We're just studying it.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.880]   You have the seal judgments.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.160]   And what's the next one?
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.240]   The trumpet judgments.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.520]   Then what's the last one?
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.960]   The bowl, right?
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   The bowl judgments, okay?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.160]   So we have 21 separate judgments that are...
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.520]   Every single one of them aren't judgments, but overall, the Archie theme is judgment,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.520]   right?
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.360]   Now, I'm going to throw this question out there, and we're going to probably deal with
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.100]   it more not next week, but the week after.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.240]   The question is, if you read from chapter six through 16, you'll see that by the time
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.580]   they get to the seventh seal, it kind of transitions into the first trumpet, right?
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.400]   And then there's kind of a chapter break between the sixth seal and the seventh seal.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   And then seventh seal is mentioned, and then the trumpets begin.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.640]   You'll notice the same thing.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.960]   At the end of the sixth seal, there is a break, right?
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.560]   It doesn't immediately go into the seventh trumpet, and there's all these things that
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   take place.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.120]   And then by the time it gets to the seventh trumpet, it opens up the bowl, okay?
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   So the question that I want you to be wrestling with and just have in your mind, that are
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.960]   these seven, seven, seven judgments, are they consecutively seven, seven, seven, meaning
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   total of 21, or are they seven judgments on the seventh one opens up the seven trumpets,
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.220]   and then on the seventh trumpet, it opens up the seventh bowl.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.840]   So collectively, it's only seven.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   You understand the question?
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.260]   It's just that the seventh one opens up the seventh trumpet, the seventh trumpet opens
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.640]   up the seventh bowl, meaning the last part of the seventh year is very, very intense.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.960]   Okay, I'm trying to see how many of you are engaging what I'm saying.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.040]   Do you understand my question?
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.240]   So I want you guys to ask that question or think through that as you're reading and
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.300]   studying through the next, what, 10 chapters, right?
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.560]   Are these seven, seven, seven, or are they meant to be seven?
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.540]   Seventh one opening up the seven, and then the seventh of that opening up the seven,
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.540]   the totality seven.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.800]   All right, I've said enough.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.040]   So just kind of mull over that as we're studying it.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.600]   I may mention it, you know, may not mention it, but again, that's one of the debates that
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.520]   they have of the interpretation of this, so just keep that in mind.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.440]   All right, some preliminary things.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.720]   What we see in chapter six is not the opening of the scroll, right?
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.920]   So they are not necessarily a scroll judgment, they're seventh seals.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.560]   So we're talking about each one of these seals, as it gets broken, it unleashes the four horsemen
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.520]   and then later on the other three, right?
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.000]   So what we're seeing is not the scroll itself, but the breaking of the seals that would eventually
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.400]   lead to the scroll.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.440]   Again, so that's our question, is that the seventh seal, when it gets broken, the scroll
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   opens up, it doesn't, and that leads into the trumpet.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.480]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.320]   And then the last trumpet opens up the bowl.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.340]   I'm not saying that that's what's taking place, I'm asking you, okay?
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.160]   So what we're looking at now is not the scroll, but the seals that are being broken.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.320]   As each seal is removed, it triggers preliminary judgment that will eventually lead to the
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.400]   opening of the scroll in chapter eight.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.080]   So at the beginning of chapter eight, we'll see that the scroll, the seventh seal is broken
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.560]   and the scroll gets opened, but prior to that, there's all these things that take place and
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.360]   all of God's judgment begins to take place one by one.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   And then again, ultimately that will lead to the opening of the scroll.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.360]   So the first four seals unleashed, it unleashed the first four horsemen and their judgment
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.480]   upon the earth.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.080]   You probably heard of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, right?
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.600]   I mean, they've, I think there was a movie.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   Do you guys remember the movie?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   Huh?
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.800]   No, no, no, it's older than that.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:49.000]   A Wild Wild West.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Nobody remembers.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Come on, Lee, help me out.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   Anyway, there was a movie and they use these four horsemen to describe the four men who
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.320]   come to fight these bad guys.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.720]   Oh man, it's right here.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.080]   It won't come out if I remember it.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.160]   If you remember, can you let me know?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.660]   All right.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.560]   So it unleashes the four horsemen and the judgments.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.240]   These four horsemen are mentioned in also in Zachariah, but there are slight bit of
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   differences.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.660]   So we're not going to jump back and forth because it's not, it's not an exact parallel,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.840]   but they are mentioned in other parts.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.580]   One of the things is the colors differ a little bit, right?
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.860]   They don't match exactly.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.360]   And then even the purpose of these horsemen, these horses were in Zachariah, they are sent
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   out to patrol the earth, but these horses are out and bringing devastation upon the
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   earth.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   Right?
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.680]   So not to say that they are not the same horse, they're not the same judgment, but again,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.320]   seems like the purpose of it is very different.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.400]   And then the actions of these four horsemen carry out the related to what Jesus says in
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.720]   the various passages, Luke, Mark, Matthew, but particularly Mark chapter 13, seven and
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.800]   eight, it says that these judgments will come, right?
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.040]   When you seize wars and rumors of wars, it says it is the beginning of birth pains, meaning
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.920]   that we're close to the end.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.520]   So one of the things that God warns us about, about the coming in times is that there's
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.200]   going to be increase in persecution, increase in hostility, increase in wars and rumors
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.560]   of war, famines.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   And so all the things that we're seeing, that this is not in and of itself is not the
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.000]   end, that those are only what's going to trigger the end.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Right?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.200]   Now, again, like I told you, I'm not going to give you like, oh, here's their view and
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:58.280]   here's the other people's view, but I do want to just broadly speaking, if you read some
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.960]   of your commentaries, they'll tell you that this all took place in the first century.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.840]   There's about three or four different approaches to interpretation of revelation.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.440]   And one of them, one of the broad ones are that it took place in the first century.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   So we're just looking at history and they'll say, you know, the white horseman is this
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.480]   person or the antichrist is Nero and the destruction is the destruction of the temple and that's
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.720]   how they apply it.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.080]   And so therefore the only thing for us to gain in revelation are principles.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.960]   I don't believe that that's the case.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.880]   And I think there's, again, in my opinion, there's enough that we'll see in revelation
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.360]   that it's pointing to a future reference, right?
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.600]   Now the idea of, is it going to be before tribulation, after tribulation, is it going
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.240]   to be literal seven years, literal thousand years?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.600]   You know, that's something that I'm going to ask you guys to wrestle with as we're studying,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.440]   but we're not studying as like this all happened.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.520]   Okay.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.040]   Just to kind of give you at least some direction.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.160]   I don't want to like say you need to believe in this, but to give you some direction.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   Okay.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.260]   So all of these things that are taking place are preliminaries.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.840]   These are events that are going to trigger.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.520]   So think about what you've already read in these four horsemen, that even if it was just
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.680]   those four things, right?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.160]   Obviously there's seven of them, even this, just four of these horsemen carried out exactly
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.620]   what he says.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.760]   Imagine how devastating the earth would be.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.320]   But the scripture says that's just the beginning of birth pains.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.760]   The actual tribulation is about to come when that happens.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.520]   In other words, it seems to be ready.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.040]   Each of these seals, with the exception of the fifth seal, seems to be escalating.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.640]   So it's not one or like each one is different.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.180]   So there are some differences, but if you've noticed that each one of these triggers the
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.540]   other one and then it escalates one above the other and it continues to get worse until
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.380]   the very end, right?
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.180]   So it's not a tribulation where it's kind of steady and then boom, all of a sudden something
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.180]   happened.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.600]   There's an increase in escalation, right?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.980]   So if we are to, whether we're in it or we're going to see the beginning of it and it'd
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.060]   be raptured, whatever view you may have, that we're supposed to watch for this, right?
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.940]   So when you see turmoil in the world and some of these things that are happening, that it
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.280]   could be birth pains, right?
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   That may trigger.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.540]   In fact, again, I'm sure everybody at some point taught teaching revelations may have
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.820]   looked at what's going on in the world and say, "Hey, this must be it."
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.660]   So I could imagine World War I, right?
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.940]   And people thought, "Well, the world, the whole world, it wasn't just one country or
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.940]   one group against another.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.720]   The whole world went into war."
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.980]   And then if that wasn't bad enough, it triggered the Second World War, you know?
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.740]   And then when that stopped and that was finished, it's like, "Man, how can it get any worse
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.900]   than that?"
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.560]   But then at the tail end of the Second World War, they developed a nuclear bomb.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.440]   So imagine, again, I'm not saying that that's the case, but imagine when the scripture says
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:06.600]   a fourth of the earth will be wiped out, you know, that's, that's would have been unimaginable.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.040]   Right now we can easily imagine that.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.560]   In fact, that's what we're afraid of, that something's going to trigger a nuclear war
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.360]   and easily a fourth, maybe even more than that could be wiped out in an instant, right?
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.760]   So a lot of these things that are mentioned here, I'm not saying that that is the case,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.160]   but the possibility of these things happening has become much more real today than it has
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.480]   ever been.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.840]   And so you see, every single one of these judgments is an escalation.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.960]   So before we get into this, now, I mean, there's obviously, there's a lot of it, but in particular
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.520]   in between chapter 6 and 16, right, where we're trying to figure out what is this trumpet,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.760]   what is this judgment, and what is the white horse, and what is the red horse, before we
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:56.720]   get into that, I don't think the first generation of Christians who received this letter had
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.560]   any more clarity, at least that we know of, that would have said, "Oh, okay, the red horse
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.080]   must be talking about this guy."
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   Right?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.320]   And I don't think the readers of the Revelation in the first century, you know, like immediately
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.580]   they read it and they knew exactly where this application was, right?
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.520]   So the question is, why did God give us something this important?
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.360]   And that's actually one of the discussion questions that I have for you at the end.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.440]   Why did God give us something this important when he told us to not to be like the Gentiles
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.520]   or the world, who's caught off guard in his second coming, is like, is not going to be
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   a thief, right?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.000]   Where you're going to be caught off guard, and it's going to be negative because you
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.120]   weren't prepared at all.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.960]   And so he told us to watch and be careful and be ready and recognize the sign of the
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   time.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.840]   So why did he give something so important, so ambiguous, right?
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.360]   So maybe, you know, maybe later on when we figure it out or when Christ comes, it's like,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.480]   "Oh, it wasn't ambiguous at all," you know?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.760]   But as of now, after 2,000 years, they're still debating, we're still trying to figure
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.300]   out what it means, you know, and everybody has different opinions.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.540]   But I think before we jump into all of this, because there's going to be a lot of discussion
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.500]   in the next 10 chapters about what does this mean, what does that mean?
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.840]   And the end conclusion is not going to be crystal clear, right?
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:26.860]   But I think we need to make sure that we receive it like the first generation people when they
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.620]   read this, what they would have heard, right?
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:38.500]   If you were the first recipients of this letter, what would have been your response?
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.660]   Because when we read it, we come out, "Huh?
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.660]   What is that?
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.940]   When is that going to happen?"
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:55.500]   If you were the first recipients of this letter, what would have been your response?
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.140]   Don't think theologically.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.660]   Huh?
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.540]   It's going to happen soon, right?
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.780]   It's going to happen soon.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.700]   So if you knew that that was going to happen soon or you thought it was going to happen
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.060]   soon, how would you have received this letter?
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.820]   Probably fear, terror.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.940]   Like, "When is this going to happen?
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.540]   Is this going to happen today, next week?"
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:25.420]   So if you thought that this was going to happen next week, I mean, forget going to work.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.820]   Forget YOLO, you know, because if he comes tomorrow, I mean, all this plan of traveling,
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.700]   all this stuff is going to be nonsense, right?
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.380]   So the initial recipients of this letter, whether that was going to happen during their
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.660]   lifetime or soon or whenever it was, whether you understood exactly what it was going to
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.220]   be, you heard a devastation and judgment.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.460]   So basically, God gave them a glimpse of his judgment, what it's going to look like.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.860]   And this judgment is going to be more devastating than anything they have probably ever imagined,
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.340]   right?
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.220]   Because if you look at it, like, we're in the beginning birth pains.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:08.180]   As we get closer, as we proceed, you'll see it's going to get much more intense than anything
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.920]   you've read this week, right?
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.340]   So I think it's important for us, as we are wrestling with the meaning and the application
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.820]   of all of this, the intent of this letter is to sober the church, right?
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.980]   The intent of this letter is so that we would not be caught off guard in making sure that
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.940]   this earth is passing away, that God's going to bring judgment upon this earth, and that
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.500]   whatever we invest here is going to be burned up because he's going to come and bring judgment.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.820]   So the intent of the letter is to, one, encourage the church.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:45.000]   Remember, John himself was probably in physical agony, and he says that judgment, retribution
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.240]   is coming toward the enemies, right?
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.560]   So in one sense, it's a comfort for Christians who are being beaten up and are being persecuted,
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.920]   but it's also a warning to the world, you know, to give a sense of soberness of the
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.800]   time that we have, that whether we live 70 years or 10 years or 20 years, that this is
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.480]   not our home, right?
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.800]   We're standing in a place where judgment's going to come and go, and there's going to
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   be devastation.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.140]   So that's the intent of this letter.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.000]   So as we're getting into and trying to wrestle with what the meaning is, let's not miss the
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.120]   larger point of this letter, which is to keep us sober and give us a paradigm and a view
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.400]   of our life in the world and end times through his perspective.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.140]   All right, so the first seal.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:40.560]   So the distinctness of the first seal, it obviously says it's the white horse, and what
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.240]   does the white horse carry?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.120]   It's not up there.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.680]   What does the white horse carry?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:18:01.520]   Come on, you read it.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   One like a voice of thunder.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.840]   Whoa.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.160]   Okay.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   All right.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.440]   I hope you guys read it.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.120]   All right, so it has a bow, right?
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:22.280]   It holds a bow symbolizing conflict and battle.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:28.640]   There are some discussion, some opinions as to who the identity of the white horse, the
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   horseman is.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:35.440]   Now again, this is not a for sure thing, but there is in Revelation chapter 1911, if you
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.120]   can turn your Bible to Revelation chapter 1911, the white horse is mentioned again,
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:48.400]   and we're not sure if it is the exact same horse or same person, but in Revelation 1911,
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.280]   "Then I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse, the one sitting on it called faithful
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.280]   and true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war."
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.440]   So kind of sounds like it because the first white horse has a bow.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   Yes?
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   Okay.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.880]   "His eyes are like flame of fire and on the head are many diadems and he has name written
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.000]   that no one knows but himself.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   He is clothed in robe, dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is the word
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   of God.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.040]   And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.480]   on white horses.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.120]   From his mouth comes a sharp sword."
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.520]   Again, all of this is a description that we've seen about Christ in chapter 1, verse 16,
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.360]   "On his robe and on his thigh he has the name written, 'King of kings and Lord of
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   lords.'"
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.880]   So clearly, the white horse, horseman, in Revelation chapter 9, that has to be Christ.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.600]   That's clearly identification of Jesus.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.540]   The only question is, is that white horse, horseman, the same white horseman of Revelation
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.080]   chapter 6?
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   Okay.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   Again, my guess is that it is.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   That's my guess.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.680]   Again, so as we continue to study, there are people who don't think it is, but it seems
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.640]   like, at least in the description, the fact that it is declaring war and that the white
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.280]   horse is shooting the bow, and that it is the first one, right?
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.220]   That him coming out triggers all the other things that take place.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.560]   So it seems like, again, it doesn't change theology one way or another, but just kind
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.040]   of something to think of, right?
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:35.640]   And as I mentioned, "On him has the phrase, 'King of kings and Lord of lords.'"
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.000]   White signifies righteousness, and the writer seems to have the task of conquering and to
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.080]   conquer, which is interesting because the phrase conquering and to conquer, right?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.520]   It seems like they're saying the same thing, but what is the purpose of saying conquering
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.640]   and conquer?
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.040]   That it's happening now, and it will keep happening.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.200]   Yes?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.300]   Right?
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.120]   So what the horse is doing, what the horseman is doing, declaring battle, there's some
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:09.040]   sort of conflict, and that he is conquering presently, that he didn't just come to conquer,
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.620]   but this act is taking place as of John writing this letter.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.440]   He is conquering, and he will continue to conquer, right?
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.680]   So it is an ongoing act.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.880]   And again, this is another reason why it seems like to me that it may be in reference to
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.800]   Christ himself, that he triggers all of this because maybe that the idea of conquering,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.940]   and you notice that the white horseman has a bow, but something's missing?
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.120]   There's no arrows mentioned.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.860]   Now, we could be reading into it, but the idea of conflict and yet without any kind
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.660]   of arrows, and yet he's out conquering.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:53.940]   So it may be an allusion to what Christ says in Matthew 24, right?
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.680]   When the gospel reaches the remotest part of the world, he said he will come, then the
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.020]   end will come.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:03.420]   So possibly if this is Christ, that his work is to conquer, is conquering, and will continue
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.540]   to conquer, meaning that the gospel will continue to be spread, right?
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.580]   Which is what's going on now.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.780]   So the spreading of the gospel is the very first thing that takes place, and eventually
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:19.420]   when the full number has come, he said that's going to trigger the second horse, right?
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:25.340]   So you and I, he is conquering and will continue to conquer.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:32.200]   We may be in that period as of now, okay?
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.660]   So the first horse triggers the second horse, which is the red horse, right?
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:44.660]   And the red horse, obviously the picture has a sword on him.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:51.040]   The red symbolizing slaughter and bloodshed, obviously it's the devastation, like the first
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.020]   one just says he's conquering and is continuing to conquer.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:59.620]   The second one says he's going to come and he's going to remove peace, which is an interesting
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.120]   way of saying that.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:07.260]   He doesn't come to bring the disaster itself, it's that which restrains war.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.180]   He said he's going to remove that.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:17.620]   And then as a result of that, he said they're going to be, what?
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:26.460]   As a result of that, "Behold a white horse," and "out came another horse, bright red, its
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.300]   rider was permitted to take peace from the earth."
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.500]   So his tack is to take peace, right?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:42.300]   He's not declaring war, he's taking peace so that the men should slay one another.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.260]   So in other words, the restraining power that's restraining the nations and individuals to
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:53.100]   go to battle and to bring peace, he said he's going to take away that presence, that peace.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.700]   And when that happens, he said basically men are free to do whatever they want, right?
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.460]   The restraining power is gone.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.780]   And that's how it's described, right?
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:09.220]   In 2 Thessalonians 2, 3 to 8, remember Paul says to this church, he said, "Don't be alarmed
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.260]   that the man of lawlessness has come, the end has come, the crisis has come, that has
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   not happened."
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.660]   He says, "Before the man of lawlessness has come, that which restrains him, right, will
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.780]   no longer restrain, and when he's not restrained, he will come.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.620]   And when he comes, he's going to do his job, right, to bring lawlessness."
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.340]   And so that's what it seems like it's describing.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:34.100]   The second seal is describing the restraining power that's keeping at least some level of
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.860]   peace, common grace, right, is going to be released.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:42.780]   And so man's sinfulness is going to be unleashed upon each other without restraint.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:48.820]   That's the second seal.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:55.060]   Third seal is the black horse.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.940]   And he's holding a, what is he holding in his hand?
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.620]   Okay, so pair of scales.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.500]   So when you think of scales, what do you think of?
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.500]   Not making money.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.980]   Judgment, right?
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.060]   Justice.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.980]   So that's what he brings, right?
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.900]   He's come to dispense justice, and the way that he's going to dispense justice, meaning
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.940]   God's judgment, is that there's going to be a famine, right?
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.620]   A quart of wheat for Daenerys and three quarts of barley for Daenerys and do not harm the
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.780]   oil and wine.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:44.340]   So basically this is a description of the judgment that's coming upon them.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:50.020]   And then the fourth seal is the pale horse.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:56.940]   And it says that his name is Death and Hades follows.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.900]   Somebody remembers this movie?
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.900]   Wyatt Earp?
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.900]   Huh?
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:11.180]   Yeah, I know, but that's not the name of the movie.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.420]   Huh?
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.420]   With Wyatt Earp?
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.980]   I don't think we're thinking about the same one.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.860]   Maybe there was another movie.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.140]   Wyatt Earp is the star of that movie?
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.140]   He is?
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.300]   Anyway, all right.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.140]   It's bugging me because I'm on the topic.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.620]   And this is the exact phrase that they use, that Wyatt Earp comes to basically get rid
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.860]   of the bad guys and he said, "Tell them I'm coming."
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.860]   Right?
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.860]   Huh?
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   Tombstone, tombstone.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.860]   There you go.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.860]   Tombstone.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.940]   Did you know it all this time and then not tell me?
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.940]   Yeah, okay.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.940]   So tombstone.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.940]   All right.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.500]   And remember the other guys that they described?
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.780]   Anyway, this is the four apocalypse.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.380]   Okay, now I can go to sleep tonight.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.380]   All right.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.140]   So he said, "His name is Death and Hades will follow him."
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.340]   In other words, the judgment that he's going to bring is going to devastate the earth.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.340]   Right?
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.420]   He said the fourth of the earth.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:13.140]   He was given authority to kill a fourth of the earth with a sword.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:21.380]   And then he said it's going to happen through sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beast.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:27.740]   So if you think about it like wild beast, you know, they got the sword, you got the
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:32.300]   famine, you got pestilence and wild beast kind of, if you think about it, it's like
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:39.460]   if devastation comes, you know, like where mankind doesn't have a border and we're basically
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.260]   living in the jungle, right?
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.660]   Then wild beast will have its way.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.460]   Again, you know, if you interpret it literally, but basically, you know, the meaning behind
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:53.940]   this obviously is that it's going to be devastating when that day comes.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.580]   So again, I want you to think about this.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.180]   You're first generation Christian listening to this, hearing this and thinking, "Wow,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.180]   this is going to happen."
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.180]   Right?
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.980]   Whether it happens during their lifetime or some other time, basically it's saying the
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.700]   earth is going to disappear.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.500]   So would you be that excited if you knew this was happening?
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.540]   Would you be that excited about, you know, building a big house or, you know, making
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.940]   plans for retirement?
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.300]   I think it would have an effect if you read this and you don't know exactly when it's
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.620]   going to happen, but it's going to happen.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.820]   It would definitely cause you to have a different paradigm of investment.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.260]   What are you going to invest in?
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.740]   So not only is Jesus saying invest in things that aren't going to, you know, rot and spoil,
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.460]   he said it's, you know, it's not even going to rot and spoil, it's going to be destroyed.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.020]   So why would you put your energy and money into that?
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.020]   Right?
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:55.380]   The fifth soil, the horsemen that are done are a description of the martyrs.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.860]   So when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:04.500]   So one of the things that I think I asked is why are they under the altar?
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.260]   The souls of those who had been slain by the word of God.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.620]   So who are these people?
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.240]   They're martyrs, right?
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.660]   These are missionaries or whoever they were.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.940]   They were, they weren't just martyred because they were Christian, they were martyred because
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.740]   they were spreading the word of God.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.020]   So people like Apostle Paul, all the apostles, right?
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.860]   And so these people were martyred for the purpose of the gospel.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.300]   And he says the fact that they were under the altar, the altar was a place where they
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:38.060]   came to worship and sacrifice, signifying that these, each one of these men and women
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:48.580]   who were martyred was serving a purpose of offering and worship to God.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.940]   Paul also, if you remember in Philippians and 2 Timothy, when he's sitting in prison
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.740]   and he's writing this letter, especially in 2 Timothy, where he says, "I am being poured
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.660]   out like a drink offering."
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:05.780]   He described his martyrdom, his execution as a drink offering.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.780]   And the reason why he describes it as a drink offering was in the Old Testament, drink offering
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.420]   was the last thing that you did before the end of the sacrifice.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.220]   So after you've given the sacrifice, you pour the drink out, meaning that that was
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.340]   kind of like the conclusion.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:25.220]   So Paul was saying that his life was a living sacrifice, but now his death is going to be
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.380]   another drink offering that is being poured out.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.740]   So Paul uses that imagery, and it seems like that's the imagery here to describe these
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.500]   men and women who were martyred for the sake of the gospel.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.900]   And they cry out, "How long before the judgment comes?
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.900]   When will they be vindicated for what has happened?"
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.020]   And what was the answer?
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:51.940]   He said, "Oh, sovereign Lord," verse 10, "holy and true, how long before you will
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.620]   judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:03.940]   Then they were each given a white robe, symbolizing righteousness, and told to rest.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:10.100]   Rest a little longer until the number of the fellow servants and their brothers should
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.100]   be complete.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.380]   So who are the number of their fellow servants and their brothers?
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.100]   There's others who are going to be martyred.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.460]   In other words, God is allowing it.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.820]   The set number of people who are going to be numbered, who are going to be martyred
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   for his name.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.740]   He says when that number is complete and your brothers and sisters join you, he says then
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:37.740]   those who will be killed, then he says the end will come.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:43.780]   So there's a set number of ordained people who will be martyred for his name.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.820]   So if you think about it, like all those people who are being martyred in the Middle East
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:55.940]   and North Korea and various parts, every single one of them, in a sense, is bringing out the
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.340]   closure of the end because they have all been ordained.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.140]   When that number gets full, he said this is all going to be triggered and Christ is going
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.140]   to come.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.660]   So it kind of gives us a different perspective of martyrs when you think of it that way,
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:18.020]   that God is absolutely sovereignly in control, even of all of this.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:28.060]   And then the sixth seal begins with a great earthquake.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:36.240]   So this great earthquake will be accompanied by the sun turning black like sackcloth made
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.300]   of goat hair and the whole moon turning blood to red and again it's a very devastating scene.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.640]   But again this is not new to Revelation.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.980]   It's mentioned in the book of Mark and in Matthew 24 where it talks about how the devastation
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:56.380]   is going to come and that is going to trigger the coming of Christ.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.500]   And what's interesting is when this judgment comes and the Lamb of God comes, we typically
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:07.260]   when we think of the Lamb of God, we think of it from our perspective that this poor
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.300]   lamb that's been slain is going to come and he's going to rescue us and we're going to
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.940]   have a wedding party.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:21.620]   But when the world sees the Lamb of God, what is their response?
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.520]   They run in terror.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.540]   They don't see a poor helpless lamb.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.900]   They say that they're going to see the wrath of the Lamb of God.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:36.980]   And when they see the wrath of the Lamb of God, it says, "Then the kings of the earth,"
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:42.060]   verse 15, "and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful and everyone
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:46.680]   slave and free hid themselves in the caves among the rocks among the mountains, calling
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.860]   to the mountains and rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.820]   on the throne and from the wrath of the coming Lamb.'"
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.900]   I think that part got cut off.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.620]   Wrath of the Lamb of God.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.660]   And we see that same scene in Malachi.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:15.500]   In Malachi 3, 2-3, "They call to the mountains and rock, 'Fall on us and hide us from the
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.280]   face of him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.060]   day of the wrath has come, and who can stand?'"
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.460]   And this shouldn't really surprise us because we see the same scene in, remember, the book
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.620]   of Genesis when Adam and Eve, what was their first thing that they do when they recognize
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.620]   their sin?
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.500]   Remember?
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.960]   They hide, right?
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.700]   When they heard his footsteps, this very God that they had fellowship, intimate fellowship
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:49.500]   with, all of a sudden when sin enters, they hear his footsteps and they hide in terror
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.260]   because of their sin.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.180]   So everyone whose sin has not been covered by the blood of Christ will see a wrathful
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.580]   God.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:03.140]   The Lamb of God is going to come and it's going to be a terrifying scene.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:09.460]   So again, when we think about the end times, and again, the question that we have to keep
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:21.940]   asking ourselves is, if this is true, and if I truly believe this, how would it affect
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.420]   you?
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.660]   How would it affect you to know that this is coming?
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.780]   And this is just the beginning of the birth pains.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:35.100]   I mean, you talk about devastation, you wait until we get into the trumpet and we get into
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.060]   the bowls, right?
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.060]   This is just the beginning.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.860]   This is what's going to spark and trigger all of that.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:48.420]   So as we have time to take some time to discuss some of these questions or some of the things
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.500]   that we have, and again, I'm going to finish a little bit early and give you time to take
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.180]   some time to discuss with your small group.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:01.740]   You know, we become so desensitized because you grow up in a church, you hear the gospel,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.220]   and then you kind of assume that because we're in the church and we're doing church things,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.260]   we're serving, we're giving.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:13.660]   But the most important question that we should be asking, as I mentioned on Sunday, is everything
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:19.060]   that I'm reading, is this true and do you believe it?
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.460]   That's one thing to say, I know Jesus loves me, that when I die I'm going to go to heaven.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:29.700]   It's one thing to say that and I believe that, but other than you receiving that, right?
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.740]   It doesn't really, other than like, I really want to worship him, which is great, that's
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.460]   what we should do.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:41.500]   But when we hear about the judgment coming upon mankind and it doesn't move us at all,
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.900]   it doesn't move us at all, that this devastation is going to come, you know, some of these
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.020]   people that we love and care about, when he comes, they're not going to have the same
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.500]   response that we're going to give, you know, yes, he's coming.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:57.300]   He said they're going to be so terrified by the wrath that's coming that they're going
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.300]   to be going up and trying to run from as far as they can and hoping that the rocks and
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.580]   the mountains would follow, just to hide them from his glory.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:13.060]   And again, to think about that and then to just say, yeah, I believe it, and then to
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:19.020]   have it not affect you, we have to ask ourselves, like, do you really believe that?
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.620]   So I think that's the most important question that we need to keep asking ourselves.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.860]   We read about these things, we're not just reading mythology.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.740]   If we believe this, what does that mean?
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:48.340]   So the discussion questions.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:54.220]   So the discussion question for you, do you think most people who claim to know the gospel
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.300]   know that the judgment is coming upon all men?
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.500]   How can you convey God's wrath just as clear as God's mercy when sharing the gospel?
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.560]   Because it is biblical, right?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:08.940]   If you share the gospel or explain about the love of God without explaining why it's the
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:14.500]   love of God to save us from his wrath, right, then we haven't given the clear or the whole
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.580]   presentation of the gospel, right?
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:24.220]   Because before the gospel gives us invitation of salvation, they have to understand why
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.820]   they need salvation, for what they need salvation.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.300]   And if they aren't saved, what is coming, right?
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.200]   So this is part of revelation.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   So how do we do that?
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.100]   How do we balance between sharing about the love of God and yet being clear about the
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.580]   wrath of God at the same time?
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.740]   Because I think we need to be motivated by both, right?
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.660]   We're not just motivated by love, we're also motivated by the coming judgment too.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:56.100]   Number two, if we won't fully know the meaning behind these vision, what is the point of
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.100]   studying them?
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.580]   Why do you think God gave us something so important in seemingly obscure vision?
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.860]   So I asked them in the very beginning, so if you guys can take some time, right, to
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.180]   discuss that.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:11.300]   So in God's wisdom, he gave us these visions in this manner for a reason.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.260]   So take some time to discuss that as well.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.660]   Number three, how does the study of the end times affect the way you walk with God?
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.940]   Do you think it is possible to genuinely believe that God's wrath is coming to mankind and
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.800]   not be compelled to warn others, right?
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:33.440]   Is it possible to say, "I have genuine faith," and yet be so complacent about the judgment
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.520]   of the non-Christian world?
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.560]   Can we say confidently that I have faith if that's the case?
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.640]   So again, take some time to discuss that in your group.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.880]   So let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys go.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.120]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:55.080]   Lord, there are so many things around us, Lord, that entangle us and cause us to constantly
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:03.360]   forget that this is not our home, that we are just sojourners, strangers passing through.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.840]   We pray, Father God, that your word would continue to sober us, that our reality, the
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:14.800]   things that we hope for, things that we invest in, would be directly affected, Father God,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.200]   by your word that we study, especially this book.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   I pray that it would have the effect on us that you've intended, that you would not just
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:30.040]   fulfill and satisfy our curiosity, but you would mold us, that you would shake us, challenge
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.800]   us, rebuke us, that we may live a life truly worthy of the gospel that you've given.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.880]   So we pray for your grace.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.500]   We pray, Lord God, that our discussion time would be fruitful, that we would be open and
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.440]   honest with each other, and that as iron sharpening iron, that we may be sharpened as a result.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.640]   We thank you, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
