[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.020]   - Getting into the church and seeing
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.500]   various habits of the flesh.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.160]   And I pray, Lord, that in seeing these things,
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.080]   we would not simply become dull or judgmental, even,
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.100]   but Father, with humility, realize that
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.020]   these are all things we need to be convicted of,
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260]   these are all things that we are susceptible to,
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.240]   and I pray, Lord, that from learning,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.040]   we would desire to be both protected
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.660]   and guard ourselves from it.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.740]   I pray, Lord, that in every time we read your word,
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.100]   we would have a heart of obedience,
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.940]   we would have a desire to apply into our lives.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.040]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340]   Okay.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.220]   All right, well, taking a look at our Bible passage
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.220]   for today, 1 Corinthians chapter six, verses one through 11.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.380]   And this is what it says.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.300]   Does anyone of you, when he has a case against his neighbor,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.460]   dare to go to law before the unrighteous
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.380]   and not before the saints?
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.300]   Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world?
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.860]   If the world is judged by you,
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.420]   are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts?
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.340]   Do you not know that we will judge angels?
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.960]   How much more matters of this life?
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.960]   So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.540]   do you appoint them as judges
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.140]   who are of no account in the church?
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.980]   I say this to your shame.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.500]   It is so that there is not,
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.780]   all right, is it so that there is not among you
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.340]   one wise man who will be able to decide
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980]   between his brethren?
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.820]   But brother goes to law with brother
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.740]   and that before unbelievers?
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100]   Actually then, it is already a defeat for you
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.480]   that you have lawsuits with one another.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.980]   Why not rather be wrong?
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.880]   Why not rather be defrauded?
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.060]   On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.980]   you do this even to your brethren.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.220]   Or do you not know that the unrighteous
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.780]   will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.340]   Do not be deceived.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.900]   Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.660]   nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves,
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.300]   nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.460]   nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.260]   Such were some of you, but you were washed,
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.940]   but you were sanctified, but you were justified
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.340]   in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.700]   and the spirit of our God.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.540]   Okay?
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.020]   So we're looking at this passage here
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.620]   and we're looking at the first segment.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.860]   Remember I said that when you look at your Bibles,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.580]   you can kinda see where the break-in thought
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.260]   of the writer was by looking at the verse numbers.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.540]   And if it's bold, you're seeing a kind of paragraph indent,
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.100]   so to speak.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.600]   And so let's tackle the first paragraph together.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.500]   And in the first six verses,
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   I asked you this question originally.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.140]   Identify what the Corinthians were doing wrong.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.120]   Well, it's really, really obvious,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.860]   but in this current context,
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.260]   the simple thing is the Christians
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.940]   in the Corinthians church, they were suing each other
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.700]   or taking each other to the court of law
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.580]   and having the court of law decide between them
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.860]   when there were disagreements, right?
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.600]   But I ask you this question.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.160]   When Apostle Paul sees this wrong behavior,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.340]   what is his tone?
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:33.680]   What observations do you make of how Apostle Paul feels
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.140]   and thinks about what they're doing?
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.520]   Anyone?
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.000]   Again, I know sometimes I ask obvious questions
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.540]   that are just right there in the text,
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.100]   but we wanna be good, I guess,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.140]   observance of what's going on.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.300]   What?
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.980]   It's shameful, okay?
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.660]   He's thinking it's shameful.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.580]   What else?
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.900]   Kind of foolish.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   How does he personally, do you think he feel about this?
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.420]   Angered and indignant, okay?
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.060]   This is kind of like funny because, you know,
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.940]   in more common like lingo lately,
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.380]   it's actually not something more recent,
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.100]   but from a while ago, you know,
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.660]   people would use this term like, how dare you?
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.420]   You know, they do something, you're like, how dare you?
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.260]   You know, and I find that to be something of an indicator
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.920]   of how he feels about it, right?
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.500]   If you think about this idea of how dare you
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.580]   and what kind of context you use that,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.780]   Apostle Paul doesn't see this as a small problem, does he?
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.780]   Rather, that kind of behavior is so far, far beyond
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.340]   what he thinks is acceptable.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.260]   He's like, how dare you?
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.040]   And I want you to just jot down
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.340]   something really interesting about that term.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.180]   It's because he asks in this way about, you know,
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.060]   dare, who basically dares to go to the law
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.940]   before the unrighteous and not before the saints.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.060]   But that term dares really interests,
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.180]   like almost hard to translate
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.260]   because it's used in many contexts as bold faced
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.000]   or in a good way, super courageous.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.820]   Really interesting, right?
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.980]   So the way he's talking about it is he's almost like,
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.220]   oh my goodness, you know, not only are you doing it,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.640]   but you're like brazen, you're bold,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.660]   you're like doing it with a sense of gusto.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.580]   How dare you, you know?
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.260]   Like that's the kind of tone I see with Apostle Paul.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.140]   What more, what's more when someone said,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.780]   yeah, is he getting indignant?
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.620]   I think he is.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.620]   Because you read the passage and the way he comes off
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.400]   is just like, well, don't you know
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.540]   that the saints will judge?
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.620]   And then he asks in verse three, don't you know?
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.380]   Right?
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.360]   When you hear his tone then, as we're reading it,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.740]   we're not listening to him audibly,
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.140]   but you can kind of guess how he feels
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.380]   about this particular sin and error in the church
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.460]   of Christians taking each other to the courts, right?
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.180]   I just wanna highlight the fact that there has been already
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.940]   multiple things happening in the church, right?
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.500]   Everything from pride, everything from selfishness
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.960]   to then immorality.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.260]   And there's a sense in which with each one,
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.860]   it's not a small deal, you know?
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.860]   So we see Apostle Paul trying to express to them
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.980]   this isn't something that you should be taking lightly.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.080]   This is something I need to address now.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.800]   But in so doing, my next question to you was,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.980]   in verses two through four,
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.020]   what is Paul trying to remind them of?
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.780]   How is he broadening their life perspective?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.540]   (mouse clicking)
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:18.300]   Okay, that they're going to be judges themselves, right?
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   So, jot that in there.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.180]   How is he broadening their perspective?
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.420]   He's reminding them this truth,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.740]   they are going to be judges.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.840]   That's really interesting.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.540]   We take a moment now to think about this a little bit.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.420]   And the scripture teaches us
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.940]   that for those who are in Christ, we are heirs with Christ.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   That is a repeated theme in the Bible, right?
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.580]   Now, to be heirs then with Christ,
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.760]   we are also going to reign with Christ.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.340]   To tell you honestly, I don't know the details
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.020]   of specifically what's that going to look like.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.660]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.140]   even in this passage, Apostle Paul says
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.420]   that we are going to reign.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.020]   Who are we going to reign over in this passage,
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.180]   just by way of simple observation?
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.740]   Who are we going to reign over?
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.840]   Just yell it out.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.980]   (laughs)
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.820]   What?
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.460]   (laughs)
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.300]   What?
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.980]   The world, what else?
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.420]   Angels too.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.660]   So combination of that, it's just kinda like,
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.840]   I don't know the details of what it's going to mean
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.860]   for us as individuals, as redeemed in Christ,
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.380]   to share in his authority and reign with Christ.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.460]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.220]   the dominion of which we are going to reign is expansive.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.820]   Not only is it going to be the world to come,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.640]   but it's going to be even divine creatures,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.500]   angels, who are sinless.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.860]   Whoa.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.460]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.100]   And I think that's something really interesting
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.620]   to think about, because there's a sense in which
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.480]   the scriptures expects us to live
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.740]   in that forward-thinking mentality.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.220]   This is who we are and going to be, right?
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.280]   Sometimes it is a humble thing for us
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.360]   to have a perspective like, we are lowly sinners.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.340]   Is that true?
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.700]   Yes.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.020]   We are marred, we're depraved, we're fallen,
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.660]   we're in the world, we're finite, all this kinda stuff.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.180]   Is that all true?
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.840]   Yes.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.100]   But I don't think it's a humble thing to remain there.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.220]   Scripture oftentimes expects us to live
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.820]   with a forward, like future reality perspective.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.820]   And that's what I mean by how is Apostle Paul
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.780]   enlightening their life perspective?
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.660]   Enlightening your life perspective is,
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.380]   from here, you move forward to royalty.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.720]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.940]   From here, you move forward to positions of authority.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.200]   From here, you move forward to God's servants
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.940]   in his kingdom, overseeing, exercising dominion
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.240]   like he expected Adam to do pre-fall.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.620]   Ever thought about that?
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.660]   That's really, really interesting.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.220]   Because of that, there's going to be a basis
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.820]   by which Apostle Paul now reasons with the church
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.820]   in saying, so what in the world are you doing
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.660]   going to human courts?
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.820]   And you kinda see the connection.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.660]   He's saying, you are people that God has now begun
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.380]   to sanctify to the point in which he's gonna glorify
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.780]   you to positions of authority.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   And here you are now, deferring judgment to pagans.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.860]   What is that all about?
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.780]   And so you almost now see his rationale
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.320]   as to why he's so appalled.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.700]   But I wanna ask you this question.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.180]   So in seeing his rationale, from verses two
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.640]   down to verse, let's say about six,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.040]   what are the negative results?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.840]   Wow, sorry for the, again, another grammatical
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.740]   awesomeness right there.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.660]   What negative, oh, actually, that makes sense.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.260]   What negative things result from Christians
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.660]   taking Christians to secular courts?
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.540]   Okay, all right.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.300]   So what negative things result from Christians
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.100]   taking other Christians to secular courts?
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.460]   From your observation of this passage,
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.700]   what things do you see?
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:42.420]   A bad witness.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.460]   I think you guys should write that in there.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.020]   Bad witness.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.620]   Can we take a look at verse five and six?
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.400]   He says, I say this to your shame.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:59.460]   Shame has the connotation of you looking
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.700]   idiotic before people.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.540]   Shame has with it idea of reputation.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.060]   Shame has the idea of evaluation from the community, okay?
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.680]   And what he goes on to say is, is it so
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.140]   that there is not among you one wise man
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.940]   who will be able to decide between his brethren?
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.020]   But brother goes to law with his brother,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.500]   and that before unbelievers?
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.260]   There's that other aspect, before unbelievers?
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.540]   Think about this for a moment.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.260]   So you have a bad witness.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.980]   Essentially, you disgrace the church, okay?
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.620]   You disgrace the believers.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.180]   If you think about what he's saying there,
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.040]   he is talking about when two people who are believers
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   take it to the world in this fashion,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.980]   what are they showing the unbelievers about them?
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.720]   That we're willing to see our own brother
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.520]   either go to jail in that day and age,
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.960]   be punished physically.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.880]   I'm willing to see my brethren have their lives ruined.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.480]   Financially, I'm willing to rip whatever is in their hand
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.440]   from them through legal process.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.380]   They're willing to air their arrogance and carnality
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.820]   and greed in front of people.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.460]   That's shameful, is it not?
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.820]   That's disgracing the community of God.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.220]   And Apostle Paul has this in there.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.900]   It's like what you show is that in your community,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.460]   guess what, there's not one single wise person.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.340]   I wanna share with you an interesting historical fact.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.980]   Is that historically, the Jews had
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.120]   their own governing system, right?
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.600]   Ever since the days of Moses,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.040]   there was a governing system amongst the Jews.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   And so if you recall the scenario with Jesus Christ,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.240]   where was Jesus Christ taken first?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.140]   The Roman courts or the Jewish courts?
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.440]   The Jewish courts.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.280]   Why?
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.720]   Because they had every legal right
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.120]   and it was their process to do that.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.940]   Not only that, but historically, the Jewish community,
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.000]   they found it to be something blasphemous
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.720]   to take their court issues to the secular courts.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.560]   Why?
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.560]   Because that would be giving authority to who?
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.320]   The God-forsaken Gentiles.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.160]   Okay?
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.480]   The Jewish community had that attitude.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.800]   Now the thing about it is, what's really interesting is,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.080]   the Roman government, the empire of the Roman nation,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.500]   obviously ruled over the Jews,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.420]   but they allowed the Jews to maintain that authority.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.760]   So the only thing the Jews could not do
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.640]   was execute somebody.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.000]   They could beat them.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.400]   They could consider them blasphemous.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.520]   They can consider them unworthy.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   They can consider them unclean.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.840]   They can consider them all these kind of stuff.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.440]   The only thing they couldn't do is execute,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.680]   and that is why with Christ, they judged him first
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.260]   on their hearing and then took him to Pilate to execute.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.160]   Okay.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.160]   Now, I bring that up because then in the eyes of the Romans,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:02.600]   for petty issues, money, for backbiting,
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.200]   for trying to sue each other,
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.360]   they bring it to the Roman courts.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.140]   How do you think the pagans would see that culture?
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.360]   They would look at them and scoff.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.420]   Bunch of idiots.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.240]   You know?
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.800]   You guys call yourself holy people.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.520]   Chosen, eh?
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.180]   I would imagine that's how the Romans
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.600]   would look at the people.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.320]   The Romans at the time looked at the Christians
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.900]   the same way they looked at the Jews.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.120]   They weren't like, oh, these are holy men.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.040]   They looked down upon them,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.800]   and they allowed them to operate in their own little circles
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.840]   and for them to come to the Roman courts
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.640]   in order to settle their business.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.160]   Like, what the heck is wrong with you guys?
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.240]   Apostle Paul's like, is not one wise person,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.640]   one godly individual who's sober-minded
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.300]   and can resolve this,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.860]   that you would take this to the courts?
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.080]   Duh!
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.000]   Right?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.480]   What else do you guys see?
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.420]   In the verses from verses two to six,
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.200]   what other negative results come
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.720]   when a Christian takes another Christian to court?
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   - They're not following Jesus' first instruction
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.960]   for the church, first of all.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.800]   - Okay.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.160]   - Matthew 18, verse 20.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.560]   Bringing your brother,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.680]   going to your brother and bringing him to the church.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.520]   - Okay.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.720]   - First instruction.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   - Good.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.040]   So, he says, basically,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.280]   you're not doing the process that Jesus Christ taught
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.160]   in giving authority to the church.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.560]   The whole process of church discipline,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.600]   like if there was an issue,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.560]   you guys should have brought the two brothers together,
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.720]   then brought another Christian individual.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.040]   If that didn't work, you should have brought the church.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   Okay?
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.320]   So, right as number two, you undermine the church.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.600]   You disrespect the church.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.440]   Okay?
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.740]   So, if you think about this,
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.840]   look at verse four and what it says in verse four.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.240]   In verse four, he says,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.280]   so if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.600]   and he says, do you appoint them as judges
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.800]   who are of no account in the church?
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.880]   Right?
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.880]   What does that mean?
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.240]   Basically, these secular judges, they have no account.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.920]   They don't have weight in the church.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.640]   How are you all of a sudden giving them the authority
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.480]   to judge issues within the church?
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.320]   Right?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   And so, what you do is you disrespect the church.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.160]   You undermine the authority of the church.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.480]   You didn't even try going to the church.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.600]   That means your perspective about the church
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.720]   is really, really small.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.040]   So, in that way, the negative result
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.320]   of going and taking your Christian brother
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.560]   to the secular courts, you actually, in so doing,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.120]   indirectly undermine the church already.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.720]   And you undermine, as Tito said,
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.920]   the process and authority by which God gave to the church.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.920]   Okay, what's another thing?
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.960]   Yes?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.160]   - You end up being judged by ungodly standards.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.560]   - Okay.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.000]   You end up being judged by ungodly standards, good.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.680]   I'm gonna have us think about that a little bit.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.160]   Because the whole idea is, the flip side is,
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.400]   you're supposed to be judged by godly standards,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.000]   Christ standards.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.680]   So, place that as number three or whatnot,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:35.120]   is you make God's standards incompetent.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:42.320]   I like that a lot, and what Mitchell said,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   is you, in so doing, you are putting on case,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.240]   like, if God has called us to love, to forgive,
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.360]   and then you completely bypass that
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.080]   to go here now to the secular courts,
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.840]   now you're functioning off of their standards,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.800]   and in so doing, is what we would typically,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.080]   in our Christian walk, now find
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.240]   as our everyday battle as a Christian.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.600]   Do we operate under God's standards or their standards?
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.080]   And that is actually just a battle
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.280]   of everyday Christian life.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.720]   And sometimes, when you decide,
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.040]   I'm gonna operate under the definitions of the world,
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.560]   there's when everything goes awry.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.280]   Everything else goes like haywire, right?
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.080]   And not only that, when you do that,
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.360]   you point to God's standards and say,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.120]   that was insufficient.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.440]   Either it was erroneous because it could never be met,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.280]   or it was insufficient to cause us to solve this problem.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.520]   You see what I'm saying with that, right?
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.720]   If you choose to function under worldly definitions,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.680]   there is something you indirectly say about God's standard.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.120]   For a people who claim to have the resources of God,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.000]   for people who claim to have the truth of God,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.280]   the wisdom of God, the spirit of God,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.120]   for us to not operate underneath that,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.520]   indirectly says those are insufficient.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.800]   Insufficient by they're either not worthy,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.320]   they were not reachable, they were not sufficient to help us.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.800]   And now I wanna put myself under pagan standards.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.120]   And the pagans are not going to say,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.820]   okay, I wanna judge between you guys, what did you do?
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.680]   Okay, then you did right, you did wrong,
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.960]   and then, you know what's really interesting is,
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.820]   back then, it wasn't so far different from today.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.400]   They actually had a ruling system
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.120]   where uninvolved third parties would come,
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.880]   kinda like jurors, you know?
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.080]   How many of you guys have been on jury duty?
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.480]   All you guys writing it off like, I'm, you know,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.320]   I'm just kidding.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.840]   You know, but you have these third party individuals
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.980]   come in, and in their almost, like, you know,
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.860]   in their way of thinking, they're gonna start deciding,
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.380]   okay, is this man right or is that man wrong?
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.540]   But what are the standards of God?
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.060]   That's the point.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.740]   So Apostle Paul, he's pointing this stuff out,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.360]   you know, when he starts saying like, let's see,
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.380]   you know, verse two and three,
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.580]   when he starts saying stuff like,
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.820]   or do you not know the saints will judge the world?
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.580]   If the world is judged by you, are you not, what,
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.200]   competent to constitute the smallest law courts?
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.040]   Do you not know you will judge angels?
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.760]   How much more matters of this life?
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.520]   What he's pointing to is, if you are going to have
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   the resources to judge that grand scale future kingdom,
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.140]   you have the means, the competency,
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.200]   to judge matters of this life.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.080]   It goes back to what?
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.000]   You have the standards, right?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.640]   You have the competency and the resource
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.560]   to judge matters of life here.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.660]   And to tell you truthfully, I think, you know,
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.940]   more Christians should have a level of confidence
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.300]   to determine right and wrong in this world.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.340]   It's not a humble thing for us to say,
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.700]   well, you know, I could be wrong, I don't know.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.500]   I actually think it's a more humble thing to say,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.740]   I've read the scriptures, and in as much as I have right
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.480]   what the scripture says, this is right, this is wrong.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.700]   It's more humble to do that.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.020]   Does that make sense?
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.080]   It's more humble under God.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.840]   It's more humble under his standards.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.100]   For Christians to be kind of like,
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.940]   eh, I know, yeah, well, this side has this side
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.780]   and that side has that side,
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.820]   they all have their good points, and who's to say?
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.180]   That's actually not humble.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.180]   We have the competency to rule and judge
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.140]   according to God's truth and through his spirit.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.040]   And I think more Christians need to have that strength
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.780]   and foundation from evaluating the scriptures, okay?
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.980]   So I wanna ask you guys,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.480]   by application of just these first six verses,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.500]   what can we draw out as applications for us?
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:04.520]   What can we draw out as applications for us?
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.280]   (pages rustling)
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:14.140]   - Just studying to show yourself approved
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.660]   and to be able to judge rightly.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.660]   - Okay, studying so that you can be approved,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.500]   so they can judge rightly, good.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.260]   That's almost like a pre-application.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.620]   To apply this verse, these verses, you need that.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.420]   We need to all study well and divide the word of God
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.220]   appropriately so that we can actually judge
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.760]   according to God's standards.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.440]   But what applications come out from us
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.840]   from these first six verses?
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:59.260]   Okay, well, think about it.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.140]   Keep thinking, okay, think about it.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.340]   I know that one application, obviously,
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.940]   like okay, so don't go to court.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.140]   But just think about it more than just that, okay?
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.160]   Let's continue and then, okay?
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.060]   Huh?
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.820]   - He mentions it's better for you to be wrong
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.280]   than to take a dispute.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.260]   But that's in the next part, but.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.360]   - Okay, right, right, right, good.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.740]   So he's talking, we're gonna start talking about
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.600]   the applications that he gives in the next verses.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.300]   And so let's take a look at the next verses here.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.380]   Verse seven through eight.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.840]   Actually then, it is already a defeat for you
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.360]   that you have lawsuits with one another.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.920]   Why not rather be wronged?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   Why not rather be defrauded?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.480]   On the contrary, you yourself wrong and defraud.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.920]   You do this even to your own brethren, okay?
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.080]   Let's begin with verse seven and take a look at it
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.420]   more closely.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.940]   He says, actually, okay?
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.360]   He's been kind of laying it on them thick,
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.760]   saying, you know, look what you're doing to the church,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.680]   look what you're doing to your reputation,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.560]   look what you're doing against the standards of God
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.440]   and the resources we have in the Lord.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   But he says, well, actually, you already lose, okay?
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.000]   When you got there, before your case was even decided,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.120]   before they gave a verdict about, okay,
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.320]   who wins and who gets the money
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.460]   or who gets the property, you lost.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.120]   I wanna ask you a question.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.360]   How is it that the Christian already loses
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.400]   when he takes another Christian to court?
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:49.060]   What does he mean by verse seven, part A?
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.980]   Okay, good, good.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.160]   That is exactly what they're doing
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.000]   and it contributes to just,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.800]   I'm gonna kind of, you know, push that.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.940]   So we're talking about winning and losing
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.560]   because we're talking about legal cases, right?
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.920]   And he uses this term like you're already defeated
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.020]   in the context of them taking each other to court
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.280]   and Grace, you're right.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.780]   They are, what do you say, defaming God, right?
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.720]   Is that what you said?
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.560]   Okay.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.720]   So you're defaming God and so forth.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.640]   So in what way are they already losing, right?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.480]   Yes?
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:54.600]   Right.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.360]   And so I think what I'm,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.600]   these are all contributing to the broader scope
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.100]   of what I wanna like really talk about today
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.480]   is because in answering the question
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.760]   of what's wrong with this church,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.920]   it's not just obviously that they're taking people to court.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.540]   There is a failure of how they're perceiving their lives,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.800]   right, and Apostle Paul is defining for them
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.440]   this is how you lose.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   Now, in this specific passage,
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.600]   he starts talking more specifically and says,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.680]   actually then it is already a defeat to you
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.260]   that you take these people to lawsuits.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.080]   Why not rather be wronged?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   Why not rather be defrauded, right?
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.560]   So there is a sense in which two part.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.120]   You guys are talking about they lose in the sight of God.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.720]   Okay, so you can jot that down.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.540]   They lose in terms of succeeding to which God has purposed.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.900]   Okay, they fail, right?
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:10.480]   But what I find really interesting is he says,
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.820]   it is already a defeat for you,
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.240]   as in you lose because why?
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.360]   When you do this, you lose your character.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.760]   So there's two parts to that.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.840]   There's a sense in which you lose because
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.200]   in terms of really succeeding,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.280]   what have you actually succeeded,
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.720]   but on the opposite end of that,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   you lose because you are losing your character.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.780]   And I want you to notice that starting from verse seven
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.120]   all the way down to verse 11,
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.300]   he starts talking about personal character quite a bit.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.000]   What defines you, what identifies you,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   what traits you have, what habits you have and whatnot.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.480]   And he's talking about that a lot.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.120]   'Cause if I think about the scenario,
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.920]   I think about these lawsuits again.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.640]   And in these lawsuits, this is what you have, okay?
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.520]   First and foremost, I mentioned to you this idea
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.120]   that in the culture,
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.960]   the Christians had a right to judge for themselves,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.400]   just like the Jews did, okay?
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   So was it necessary to go to the court?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.120]   No.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.920]   If, let's say for example, Chris and I had
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.800]   a bet on who won a game,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.760]   and I promised him a thousand bucks,
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.820]   and after promising him a thousand bucks,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.960]   I failed to pay up.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.040]   Seems like a pretty slam-dunk case, right?
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.440]   We made a bet, I didn't pay, I need to pay.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.920]   Now, here's the interesting thing though, okay?
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.920]   How come we couldn't just resolve that
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.160]   in the capacity that already existed
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.440]   in their immediate community, their church?
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.720]   (audience member coughs)
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.040]   It leads me to believe that they're doing more
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.960]   than just trying to set things straight.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.920]   Notice how he starts talking about defrauding a brother.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.680]   Notice how it talks about, you know,
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.420]   going above and beyond simple retribution,
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.400]   but wronging each other, okay?
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.800]   Wronging each other.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.880]   So I bet you, part of the reason why an individual
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.120]   couldn't just take this to a Christian court,
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.680]   a Jewish court, a religious court,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.120]   is because whatever they're doing was probably unethical.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.220]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:28.520]   For example, for example, if in the US right now,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.740]   you were wronged or you experienced some kind of injustice,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.080]   you could sue, and typically you sue for a lot more
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.680]   than perhaps what the infraction was, right?
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.760]   Now, if you were to, in clear conscience,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.680]   like, "No, I just wanna get what's due to me,"
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.980]   then you could just go to the court
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.280]   that's already established, but if you want more,
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.320]   I can't go there, can I?
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.960]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.640]   So there's a sense in which I think
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.760]   they were probably trying to take
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.400]   financial advantage of each other.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.200]   I think in their public litigation,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.720]   it evidenced probably a deep-seated desire,
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.040]   a fleshly desire, to win more than what was due, okay?
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.560]   They were trying to take advantage of each other.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.760]   Take advantage of the situation.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.300]   If I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win big,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.520]   and I will never lose to you.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.200]   Perhaps that was the mentality.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.440]   And so in Apostle Paul's mind,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.180]   just the fact that you are here in the pagan court,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:26.180]   you already lose, not because you lose the court case,
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:31.600]   but because you lose your dignity, you lose your character.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.720]   It's just like, I think I used this analogy before,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.920]   but I actually wrestled in high school in my ninth grade,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.880]   and when I wrestled in high school,
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.280]   there weren't enough girls to actually have
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.120]   tournaments with just girls.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.960]   So if there was a girl who played,
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.280]   she was typically the only one.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   And there was this moment when our B team
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.760]   was wrestling another school's B team,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.280]   and there was a girl on that team.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.920]   I wrestled at 115, which is really light.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.960]   So thankfully, I didn't have to wrestle a girl,
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.920]   'cause typically girls are at 105, okay?
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.600]   Well, one of our buddies, he had to wrestle a girl.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.720]   And obviously, he knew automatically,
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   like, I'm gonna win, you know?
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.440]   But he just so decided, there's this move,
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.000]   you just shoot for both legs.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.880]   Shooting is you just go for the heels of both legs,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.040]   and you put your noggin right in the person's stomach,
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.480]   or your shoulder in the person's stomach.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.680]   And that's what he did.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.200]   And when you do that, you just lift up,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.520]   her body just goes up in the air,
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.840]   and then he slammed her with his head.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.560]   And he got up and went, "Oh!" like that,
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.720]   and all of us were like.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.560]   He didn't win that day, okay?
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.160]   Because by doing that, by arrogantly going,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.100]   "Er," like he won, nobody was gonna be like, "Good job."
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.400]   Why, because he completely lost the respect of all the guys,
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.240]   and he lost the respect of the girl, too.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.400]   You just don't do that, right?
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.080]   You don't do that.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.720]   In the same way, there are things you can win,
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.280]   but you're not gonna win,
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.200]   because you're gonna lose spiritually,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.880]   integrity, morally, ethically, right?
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.920]   You just don't do it because you win the match,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.760]   but so what?
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.380]   You just didn't win at all,
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.880]   not on the side of the entire team,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.620]   not on the side of the other team, like nobody, okay?
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.240]   That's like here, Apostle Paul is saying,
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.560]   "I think you guys have the absolute wrong definition
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.600]   "of success here.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.200]   "Your definition of success is,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.020]   "I'm never gonna be taken advantage of.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.680]   "No one's gonna get the best of me.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.060]   "I'm gonna take this guy to the house,
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.660]   "and I'm gonna wipe him clean."
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.180]   That's the worldly definition of success.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.860]   You didn't win nothing.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   As a matter of fact, actually, you lost, okay?
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.640]   That's the point that Apostle Paul is making.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.880]   And for us, there's a point of conviction there,
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.480]   because to tell you honestly,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.480]   sometimes I have that kind of heart sometimes.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.600]   I don't know if you guys have ever experienced
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.640]   that come out of you.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.200]   Sometimes people do stuff, and you're like,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.640]   "That's okay, I didn't even care.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.720]   "Just actually here and take some more," or whatever.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.600]   And then for some odd reason, somebody does something,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.440]   you're like, "No."
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.480]   You're gonna know you did wrong,
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.520]   and you're gonna pay, you know?
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.120]   And it comes out of you, and you just realize,
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.600]   like, wow, that's kind of scary.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.280]   And on our off days when we're not sober,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.480]   doesn't it come out like that sometimes?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.800]   No, you're just not gonna get the best of me.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.400]   And sometimes we buy into it.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.440]   Sometimes we just, maybe it's because we're competitive,
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.920]   and we don't want people to get away with wrong.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.400]   Sometimes we're prideful, and we're like,
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.520]   "I ain't no pushover.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.000]   "I'm not a pushover, and you can't do this to me."
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.160]   And so you retaliate, or you just kind of avenge yourself.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.440]   You know?
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.120]   And that is actually the heart
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.240]   of which Apostle Paul is getting at, isn't it?
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.040]   As to why these problems exist.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.760]   So, Apostle Paul asks this question,
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.160]   why not rather be wronged?
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.620]   Why not be defrauded?
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.120]   And I ask this question, what is the principle
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.160]   that Apostle Paul is advocating here?
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.920]   Okay, what is the principle
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.000]   that Apostle Paul is advocating?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.340]   Well, I think, you know,
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.300]   I'm gonna ask you guys for the principle
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.740]   after we look at some of these cross-references,
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.560]   but you guys know the principles
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.120]   that are taught in scripture.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.640]   I just thought it would be spiritually really good for us
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.040]   to remind ourselves of some of these principles.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.800]   Turn your Bibles to Matthew.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.520]   Matthew chapter five, verse 38 through 48.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.280]   (pages rustling)
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:40.200]   So Matthew five.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:54.780]   Okay, and this is what Jesus says.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.360]   He says, "You have heard that it was said,
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.880]   "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.760]   This is known as a lex talionis.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.680]   This is, you know, this principle.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.800]   You lose a goat, you're gonna have to give a goat,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.880]   or you deserve a goat.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.800]   It's eye for an eye, tooth for tooth.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.580]   In verse 39, he says, "But I say to you,
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.180]   "do not resist an evil person,
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.240]   "but whoever slaps you on your right cheek,
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.180]   "turn the other to him also.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.300]   "If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.180]   "let him have your coat also.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.020]   "Whoever forces you to go one mile,
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.160]   "go with him too.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.080]   "Give to him who asks of you,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.620]   "and do not turn away from him
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.660]   "who wants to borrow from you.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.140]   "You have heard that it was said,
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.880]   "you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy,
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.320]   "but I say to you, love your enemies
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.220]   "and pray for those who persecute you,
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.260]   "so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.000]   "For he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.700]   "and sends his reign on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.440]   "For if you love those who love you,
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.300]   "what reward do you have?
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.940]   "Do not even the tax collectors do the same.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.240]   "If you greet only your brothers,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.700]   "what more are you doing than others?
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.060]   "Do not even the Gentiles do the same.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.140]   "Therefore, you are to be perfect
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.320]   "as your heavenly Father is perfect."
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.160]   There's so much to be said just from that short excerpt
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.960]   from our Lord Jesus, right?
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.560]   I don't believe this idea of if someone slaps you,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.400]   turn to the other one applies in every single circumstance.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.400]   If you're a governor, if you're a ruler,
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.600]   if you're responsible for our family,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.800]   you don't, that guy took one child,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.640]   I'll give him my other child.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.400]   Like, that doesn't work that way.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.420]   But if you're a Christian,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.000]   proclaiming to be a son of God,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.600]   this is supposed to be something unique about you
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.160]   that makes you primarily a son of God.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.940]   To be able to love beyond measure,
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.360]   to be able to love beyond what's expected, right?
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.020]   To be able to absorb that slap in the face
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.000]   and not retaliate, that's something unique
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.840]   to what God has done.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.560]   He says, "To emulate your Father in heaven,
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.940]   "that's why you do this."
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.440]   Okay?
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.160]   Another passage, 1 Peter 3, verse eight through nine.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.160]   He says, "To sum up, all of you be harmonious,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.800]   "sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit,
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.740]   "not returning evil for evil or insult for insult,
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.020]   "but giving a blessing instead.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.600]   "For you were called for the very purpose
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.340]   "that you might inherit a blessing."
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.180]   Okay?
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.880]   Another passage I want us to turn to,
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.320]   Romans 12, 17 through 21.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.120]   Romans 12, 17 through 21.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:39.720]   Okay?
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.460]   And this is what, again, the word of God says.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:48.020]   He says, "Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.900]   "Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.120]   "If possible, so far as it depends on you,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.920]   "be at peace with all men.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.800]   "Never take your own revenge, beloved,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.740]   "but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.020]   "'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,' says the Lord.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.440]   "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.440]   "But if he is thirsty, give him a drink,
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.480]   "for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.100]   "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.260]   I think there was a sense in which a lot of this
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.520]   was going on in the Corinthians church.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.440]   Some guy, yeah, it could easily happen.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.500]   It's like, "Dude, let me borrow this, you know?
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.160]   "Please, please, please, I'll pay you back."
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.720]   Two months later, "Sorry, I can't pay you back.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.280]   "But you're a Christian, so let it go, right?"
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.300]   And the guy's like, "What?
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.240]   "You promised!"
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.380]   And then they go back and forth,
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.840]   and you can imagine those finances getting
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.920]   in the midst of brothers and whatnot.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.360]   And you can imagine, in a church, we can have fights,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.460]   we can have conflict, right?
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.660]   Well, one of the questions I wanna ask you first
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.920]   before going to application is,
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.340]   how would you summarize this principle,
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.040]   put it in a way you can remember and has
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   as a life principle for yourself?
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.320]   When Apostle Paul says, "Why not rather be wrong?
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.700]   "Why not rather be defrauded?"
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.200]   When you hear the words of Jesus,
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.220]   what's a good way to summarize this principle
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.500]   we're supposed to live by?
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.660]   (silence)
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:23.200]   How would you put it, you know,
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.700]   in a brief, concise, your own words kind of way?
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:31.900]   Jonas? (laughs)
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.940]   What do you think, man?
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.180]   (silence)
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.340]   (silence)
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:50.420]   How would you summarize the principle
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:55.020]   that Apostle Paul is wanting the church to live by
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.680]   when he asks the question, "Why not rather be wrong?
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.340]   "Why not rather be defrauded?"
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:06.060]   Be peacemakers, okay?
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.900]   Good, be peacemakers.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.460]   How else would you guys say it?
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:18.140]   Yes?
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.540]   - Showing grace as you've been showing grace yourself.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.500]   - Okay, good, showing grace
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.400]   as you've been showing grace yourself.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.140]   What else?
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:37.760]   Leave judgment to God, good.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.960]   Okay, good.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   So now, let's talk about practically applying this, okay?
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.840]   How would you make some practical applications
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.680]   from what we've been learning so far?
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.840]   How would we apply this to ourselves?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.360]   I know I have like first half sentences
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.720]   underneath that stuff, but we don't have to go
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.960]   just according to what I wrote as applications I drew.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.640]   I want you guys to think about how do we apply this?
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.800]   Aside from just like, okay, again,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.280]   the simple way to do Bible study is like,
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.040]   okay, he says, you guys are idiots
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.880]   for going to court with each other.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.000]   I'll never do that.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.280]   Even if I'm mad, I'll never take someone to court.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.160]   Good, I'm done.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.640]   But we just realize he's digging deeper than just that.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.480]   You know, he's talking about certain attitudes.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.720]   How do we apply some of these things?
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:50.760]   Yes.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.520]   - Think highly of the church and seek out wisdom.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.840]   - Yeah, that's really good.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.180]   Think highly of the church and seek out wisdom, you know?
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.160]   There's been a lot of times for me personally
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.460]   when someone has come to me for counsel,
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.440]   but it was so late in the game.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.520]   They've already tried to reconcile their own way.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.680]   They've already had negative responses.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.280]   They've built, built, built, built, built,
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.160]   and now they're like, they haven't talked
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.000]   to each other for months,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.120]   and then they're like, can you help me?
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.280]   I'm like, oh, I wish you would've talked to me
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.800]   like six months ago, you know?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.520]   Or even, this doesn't have to be pastor,
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.880]   but there are many people in the church
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.520]   that have been Christians walking faithfully
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.600]   for many, many years, and they have wisdom to share.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.660]   And we as members of the church need to seek counsel
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.100]   from each other and be open to abide
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.780]   by the counsel we receive, okay?
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.620]   What else?
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:50.440]   Any others?
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:58.420]   Yes.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.500]   - It's better to be faithfully than selfishly.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.360]   - That's really good.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.000]   It's better to lose gracefully than win selfishly, okay?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.720]   It's better to lose gracefully than win selfishly.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.080]   I think that's something that you can apply.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.540]   Sometimes, as a man, I make my decisions on like,
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.580]   stuff like risk analysis, cost benefit,
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.680]   or just getting the thing done, you know?
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.840]   But sometimes, you have to consider this fact,
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.760]   like, you know, in this decision that I'm making,
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.500]   my goal is not just to win, or my goal just isn't
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.060]   to get the result that I was wanting.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.400]   I'd rather be more gracious
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.200]   and have Christian character in this.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.660]   So if it's gonna look like I'm just being selfish,
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.300]   then even though it makes sense financially,
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.700]   practically, risk, and all that stuff,
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.460]   I'll rather lose gracefully.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.560]   That's really good.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.180]   Any others?
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.000]   Yes.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.660]   - I think that there's this balance between
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.720]   judging the Christ's benefits,
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.760]   but like, how to know Jesus for your sake,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.560]   because like, you know, there's a great Christ,
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.640]   and yet, you're supposed to hold your life accountable
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.560]   and like, have--
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.520]   - Yes, right.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.360]   Okay, so you're right.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   There is a balance of holding each other accountable
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.120]   where if someone brought an issue to the church,
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.000]   then they're going to exercise wisdom and justice
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.080]   in order to set things right.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.240]   But between the two parties, there's always room
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.760]   and actually need for grace and mercy, right?
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.720]   And I think that's something that, for me,
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.100]   I was super challenged by.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.060]   Because in order to practice what he's saying,
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.640]   you do have to be able to, and so point two for me,
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.880]   you know how it says, as a Christian, we can,
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.340]   and I left it blank?
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.760]   For me, as a practical application, for me, I wrote,
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.560]   I can absorb cost, right?
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.320]   For Jesus Christ, our Savior, he was able to absorb what?
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.120]   Pain, suffering, penalty, that's cost.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.600]   Cost of sin.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.560]   And one of the things that we do then, uniquely as Christians
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.440]   that perhaps the world is not willing to do
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.520]   is absorb the cost, okay?
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.760]   I want you to go in your Bibles to Matthew 18
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.160]   about that story of forgiveness,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.720]   and I want you to realize that there is an element of cost
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.320]   in the idea of forgiveness.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.260]   So go to Matthew 18, okay?
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:39.160]   Matthew 18, verse 21 and on.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:45.240]   And this is what Jesus says as he's teaching Peter.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.920]   Then Peter came and said to him,
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.720]   "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.760]   "and I forgive him?
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.600]   "Up to seven times?"
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.280]   And Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.560]   "up to seven times, but up to 70 times seven."
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.800]   And as you guys have probably heard in many sermons
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.860]   and in your own Bible studies,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:08.440]   70 times seven is not just a number,
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.520]   but it's an idiomatic phrase saying completely.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.400]   There's no end, just keep forgiving him.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   As long as he is repenting and coming to you,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.840]   keep forgiving him.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.160]   But look at the story he gives.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.240]   He says, "For this reason the kingdom of heaven
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.500]   "may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.520]   "with the slaves.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.680]   "When he began to settle them,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.360]   "one who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.080]   "But since he did not have the means to repay,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.060]   "his lord commanded him to be sold
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.820]   "along with his wife and children and all that he had
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.420]   "so that repayment may be made.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.060]   "So the slave fell to the ground
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.300]   "and prostrated himself before him saying,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.860]   "Have patience with me, I will repay you everything.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.600]   "And the lord of that slave felt compassion
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.580]   "and released him and forgave him the debt.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:53.880]   "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.440]   "who owed him 100 denarii and he seized him
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.180]   "and began to choke him saying,
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.180]   "Pay back what you owe.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.800]   "So his fellow slave fell to the ground
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.700]   "and began to plead with him saying,
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.220]   "Have patience with me that I will repay you.
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.760]   "But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.740]   "until he should pay back what was owed.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.880]   "So when his fellow slave saw what had happened,
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.900]   "they were deeply grieved and came to report to the lord
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.160]   "all that had happened.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.800]   "Then summoning him, his lord said to him,
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.320]   "You wicked slave, I forgave you all the debt
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.840]   "because you pleaded with me.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.320]   "Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.840]   "in the same way that I had mercy on you?
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.080]   "And his lord removed with anger,
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.680]   "removed his, say, and his lord removed with anger,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.060]   "sorry, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.520]   "until he should repay all that was owed.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.760]   "My heavenly father will also do the same to you.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.080]   "If each of you does not forgive his brother
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.680]   "from your heart."
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.520]   Okay.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.840]   In that story, something that I kinda,
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.600]   not kinda, but really caught my attention
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.580]   and I kept focusing on was this,
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.220]   is the idea of absorbing cost.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:08.940]   I feel like perhaps sometimes
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.840]   when we wanna forgive somebody,
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.280]   there is a sense in which I wanna be able
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.000]   to forgive somebody still without bearing cost.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.680]   I might forgive you because I might have felt offended
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.400]   and I'm not gonna be offended at you anymore.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.880]   I might not be angry at you anymore.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.040]   But there's a sense in which we kinda lose this idea
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.880]   of the cost.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.720]   Because in order for the king,
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.400]   in order for the ruler to forgive his slave,
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.880]   and in order for the slave to forgive his friend,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.200]   what do they have to do?
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.440]   They have to absorb great cost.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.280]   Right?
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.160]   Well, in order for there to be a kind of,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.120]   I am willing to be wronged,
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.020]   I am willing to bear the injustice of my brother,
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.840]   what do you have to do?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.300]   You have to be willing to absorb that cost.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.920]   If you're still sitting there demanding,
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.160]   I'm gonna forgive you but you're gonna have
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.400]   to repay everything.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.240]   I'm gonna have to forgive you
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.640]   but I want you to make it up.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.320]   I wanna forgive you but you're gonna have
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.960]   to do me a favor because I'm doing you a favor.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.640]   Is that the kind of biblical forgiveness,
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.300]   mercy, and willingness God is expecting of us?
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.600]   I don't think so.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.640]   Yes.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.360]   - So,
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.440]   (mumbles)
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.640]   Does that include,
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.800]   (mumbles)
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:36.200]   Does like,
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.160]   precautions to kind of protect yourself,
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.080]   you know that it's gonna happen again?
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.740]   - Does that go against his idea?
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.840]   - Let me see if I understand your question correctly.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.680]   He said,
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.400]   in the giving of forgiveness,
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.760]   there's somebody who repeats their sin.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.680]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.640]   Somebody who repeats their sin
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.320]   and then you take precautions to protect yourself
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.520]   against that individual.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.840]   Does that now negate my forgiveness of him?
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.520]   (mumbles)
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.360]   No, I don't think so.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:13.960]   'Cause I can think of many situations where,
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.320]   let's say, yeah, let's say, you know,
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.000]   I ask somebody to watch my child
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.440]   and that person flipped the lid
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.660]   and somehow abused my kid.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.320]   But that guy came to me and said,
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.800]   I am, will you please forgive me?
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.680]   I lost my temper.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.440]   I did something so wrong.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.440]   Will you forgive me?
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.040]   Right?
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   What I'm saying is, if I said, sure, I forgive you,
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.320]   and then I turn around, I'm like,
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.880]   I'm gonna report this guy to police.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.480]   And like, you know,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.800]   I think there is a disconnect between my forgiveness of him
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.340]   and what I'm telling him,
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.120]   because I'm holding it against him
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.160]   and expecting him to pay.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.720]   But if I tell him the next time,
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.120]   I'm like, hey guys, I need somebody to watch my kid,
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.900]   and he's like, oh, I'll watch your kid.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.960]   And I tell him, you know what?
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.040]   This might sound a little offensive,
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.280]   but I'm gonna find somebody else.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.000]   Is that not forgiving?
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.800]   Not necessarily.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.600]   Do you see the difference?
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.920]   Now, the thing about it is, for example,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.360]   if I lend somebody money and they say,
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.480]   please forgive me, I can't repay you.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.500]   I'm sorry that I asked you to lend me money,
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.900]   but to tell you truthfully, I knew I couldn't pay you back.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.080]   I just needed the money in the moment,
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.320]   but there was no way I was gonna pay you back.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.960]   Like, I don't have the money for that.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.200]   Will you forgive me?
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.280]   I can tell him, yeah, I forgive you.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.440]   The next time he asks me money,
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.880]   and he says, ooh, can I borrow a thousand bucks?
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.000]   I'm gonna look at him and say,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.520]   show me what you got to pay me back.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.400]   And he says, oh, you know, you just gotta trust me.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.240]   Didn't you forgive me?
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.000]   And I'm like, I forgave you.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.520]   That's why we're still friends.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.320]   Show me how you're gonna pay me back.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.820]   That's not going against my forgiveness of the individual.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:45.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.360]   What's really interesting is,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.200]   the Book of Proverbs actually has a lot to say about that.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.560]   Both on the level of, when you're lending to people
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.600]   or when you're entrusting to people, guard yourself.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.640]   So, the Book of Proverbs will actually say,
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.760]   if you're gonna lend somebody money,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.680]   don't expect it back.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.600]   Lend with an idea of, I'm gonna give this to this person.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.420]   Right?
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.080]   And in that way, you're guarding your own heart,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.440]   and you're guarding yourself.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.800]   And the Book of Proverbs actually teaches you a lot about,
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.380]   don't shake hands, as in, permissory notes.
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.840]   I'm gonna promise you,
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.680]   I'm gonna go into this loan with you
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.160]   as a guarantor of your loan, all that kind of stuff.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.000]   Why?
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.420]   Because it's protecting yourself.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:29.340]   But, nonetheless, that protection of yourself
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.720]   has nothing to do with, in my relationship with you,
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.000]   we have no animosity.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.680]   I hold this not against you.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.000]   I'm not gonna hold it against you in the future.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:38.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.280]   I'm not gonna expect you to pay this back.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.580]   I've incurred the cost and forgave you.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.240]   I think that's very different from saying,
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.600]   in wisdom, I'm just guarding
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.000]   so that none of this kind of stuff happens again.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.160]   I'm not sure if, am I answering your question?
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.800]   I'm not sure if, I'm getting, okay.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.680]   'Cause your facial expression kinda looks like,
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.320]   like, mm, I don't know.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.160]   What do you think?
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.760]   We can talk about it more after.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:05.040]   But hopefully that kinda addresses, yeah.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.480]   - It's just what it normally looks like.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.040]   (laughing)
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.480]   - Okay.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.880]   I'm not gonna repeat what you said.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.920]   All right, any other applications,
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.360]   any other applications that you see from this thing?
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   I mean, let me just give out some more, I mean, like,
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.560]   someone mentioned repaying evil,
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.200]   not being overcome with evil.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.680]   I also think that there's this temptation,
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   there is this temptation to escalate, okay?
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.280]   I think about the litigation and you realize, like,
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.920]   there's a buildup, right?
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.280]   How many guys have ever gone into a fight
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.120]   and it escalated from, like, you know, I don't know,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.520]   some guy did something and he turned into, oh my gosh,
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.600]   like, he's, like, you know, like,
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.000]   I'm thinking in Korean right now, but.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.240]   (laughing)
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.680]   What is nunchi eopseo in, like,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.320]   well, anyway, you start judging the guy's character,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.640]   you know, the guy does something, like,
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.360]   he forgets the birthday or he gets something
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.800]   and the next thing you know, you start judging his character,
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.480]   he doesn't care, like, he's so slob, he's lazy,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.440]   he's irresponsible, it's like, he just forgot, you know,
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.240]   like, you just start escalating things
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.080]   and especially if you're fighting, man,
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.600]   like, I've had occasions when you're just fighting
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.920]   or you're just disagreeing and all of a sudden
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.160]   you're disagreeing and it escalates to the next thing
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.920]   and it's like, oh my goodness, you do this
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.400]   and then you say something, it's like, oh my gosh,
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.000]   you can't say this and the next thing you know,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.960]   it's like, oh, you're having an all-out war.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:32.800]   Doesn't it escalate?
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.920]   And I think about getting to the point of lawsuit,
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   I'm pretty sure it started from something
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.240]   and it just kept on escalating, you know?
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.640]   So, if you,
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:51.240]   oh yeah, so like, as an example,
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.640]   from our own passage in verse eight,
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.920]   he, I think there's an escalation that you can see
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.560]   just from the nature of looking at verse eight
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.800]   and seeing, okay, there's this disagreement,
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.380]   there's, you know, all this kind of stuff,
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:04.200]   but then it gets to a point where it says,
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.760]   on the contrary, you yourself is wrong in the fraud,
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.800]   so now you've escalated to the point
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.080]   where you yourself, all of a sudden, are doing the wrong.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.320]   And I find that happening sometimes, okay?
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.600]   I'm not gonna belabor the point,
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.160]   but for us, more typically, it's verbally, okay?
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:26.000]   Someone hurts you, and what sometimes we're tempted to do
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.200]   is escalate it by hitting them back, whoa,
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.280]   hitting them back verbally, okay?
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.040]   There's been times when, you know, I get into an argument,
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.440]   and, you know, in the beginning, everyone's cordial,
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.520]   and you wanna try to, like, figure it out,
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.680]   and you're talking and stuff like that,
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.880]   and after a while, all of a sudden,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.840]   you start saying mean things to each other,
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.980]   and it has no other purpose than,
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.980]   you know what, you did something silly,
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.520]   you did something to hurt me, here it is,
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.680]   you slap me, I slap you back,
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.520]   and then, with words, you end up fighting, okay?
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.600]   So my point is, we have to resist the temptation
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.120]   to escalate the matter, okay?
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.000]   There are a lot of other things
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.360]   that perhaps we can take a look at,
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.280]   I just wanna wrap up with the next section.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.980]   Let's go to verse nine through 11.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.240]   He says, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.560]   "will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.640]   "Do not be deceived, neither fornicators,"
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.920]   fornicators are those who are single.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.120]   Was it this Bible study?
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.880]   Oh, sorry, it was the other one.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:29.780]   "For fornification in this day and age is so rampant,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.220]   "we even call it now people being just romantic,
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.000]   "single individuals who are not married,
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.500]   "coming together, and breaking all kinds
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.920]   "of physical boundaries.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.220]   "It happens a lot, I know that it's difficult
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.940]   "to fight against, but in the end,
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.860]   "what is that but fornification?
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.500]   "Idolaters, people who idolize various things
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.940]   "in their lives, whether it's man-made,
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.420]   "whether it's cultic, they idolize.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.100]   "Drunkards, revilers," oh, shoot, sorry,
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.560]   I totally missed the line.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.160]   "Adulterers, effeminate, homosexuals, thieves,
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.440]   "covetous, drunkards, revilers, swindlers
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.400]   "will inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.820]   Okay, my question to you guys is,
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.480]   what is Paul's purpose in listing these categories
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   of people who will not go to heaven?
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.500]   What do you think is his purpose in his reasoning
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.940]   and arguing with the church?
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.940]   Why he would sit and list this list of categories
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.300]   of people who are sinful?
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:35.300]   So that they won't what?
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.900]   Okay.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.160]   Excellent, yeah.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.460]   I think there's a reason why he's sitting there
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.620]   and then all of a sudden he just paints this big brush
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:55.420]   and says, "This is like the types of sin that exists."
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.060]   (imitates explosion)
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.540]   And we know these are the pagans
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.140]   who won't enter the kingdom of God, you know this.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:04.420]   And then he goes in verse 11,
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.540]   "And these were pretty much you guys."
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.920]   So think about that.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:16.140]   The emphasis of this whole segment comes in verse 11
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:21.220]   because there exists a profound and emphatic contrast.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.860]   Notice how verse 11 reads, "But you were washed,
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.300]   "but you were sanctified, but you were justified."
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.900]   Those little contrasting words, connecting words, but.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.040]   In the Greek, there's actually multiple ways of saying that.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.080]   There's actually about six different ways to contrast.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.120]   This word happens to be the strongest contrasting word.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.540]   Okay?
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.660]   You guys know, you guys have probably heard in the Greek,
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.660]   there's multiple ways of saying no.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.500]   There's like just no.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.220]   On the contrary, but it's like no, indeed no.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:56.060]   It's like no, not ever.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:59.460]   There's degrees of these contrasting words.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.340]   Likewise, in this place,
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:06.100]   this contrasting word is the most emphatic.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.300]   But instead, you know.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.600]   And he says, "These were what you were,
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.020]   "but instead, this is what God did.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.500]   "He washed you, he sanctified you, he justified you."
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.060]   Right?
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.380]   I think this is a great way to encourage the church
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.540]   that's practicing this kind of,
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.280]   "I'm not gonna lose, I'm gonna fight,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.380]   "I'm gonna have my revenge, and I'm gonna set it right."
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.480]   The challenge is to practice godly character.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.220]   You need to forgive.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.700]   You need to reconcile.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.860]   You need to be willing to absorb cost.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.140]   You need to be willing to keep the peace in the church.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.340]   Right?
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.700]   And in many ways throughout scripture,
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.620]   Apostle Paul has used the basic foundation of the gospel
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.200]   to tell them, "This is who you need to be."
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.500]   All right?
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.540]   Okay.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.160]   Any questions about this passage?
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.000]   Yes.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.260]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:03.600]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:10.820]   You know what, I didn't even look into that
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.380]   in terms of comparing that verse,
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.460]   but you're saying the NIV does not have the word effeminate,
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.760]   whereas the NASB does?
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:26.580]   Huh, that's interesting.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.540]   I'll give that to you as homework, okay?
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.620]   (laughs)
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.340]   You're gonna look that up for us,
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.380]   and then you're gonna give us your finding after.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.660]   (laughs)
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.060]   All right, we'll talk later.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.420]   Any other questions?
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:43.020]   Yes.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.180]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:58.340]   Yeah, oh, that's a good question.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.800]   So he was talking about,
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.740]   does this apply to Christian to Christian only,
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.660]   or does it also apply broadly to Christian to non-Christian?
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.700]   Right?
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.900]   I'm gonna tell you truthfully that
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.540]   the boundary is not clear-cut,
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.220]   but there exists a boundary.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.460]   Because, for example,
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:22.500]   when you have two Christian individuals,
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.060]   they're all submitted under,
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.900]   or theoretically, they're all submitted
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.260]   under the Spirit of God and the Word of God.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.340]   And so the church can come in and reason with both,
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.420]   through the Spirit and through the Word, right?
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.620]   But you have a party that's non-Christian,
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.060]   that doesn't have the Spirit.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.100]   How can the church come in and do that?
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.980]   So actually, now it behooves the Christian individual
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.000]   to exercise a great amount of wisdom.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.580]   There's a sense in which,
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.300]   there's two philosophies about that, too.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.180]   So I actually just read an article where,
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:54.540]   in one philosophical thought,
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.820]   they want to push the agenda of justice
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.700]   in order to share the gospel.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:02.620]   Meaning, if a non-Christian does injustice to you,
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.740]   they think you should actually cause that individual
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.620]   to see in you a commitment to justice, to righteousness,
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.420]   so that you can share the gospel.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.380]   To say, you know what?
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.300]   You're not upholding even what we believe in our,
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.660]   like, you know, community and culture, to be righteous,
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.340]   and that's because you're a sinner.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.220]   And so they can have a platform for the gospel.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.460]   Obviously, there's another group of people
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.940]   that says, no, you exercise Christian love
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.220]   to even the non-Christians,
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.900]   so that the kindness of God
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.340]   will convict them to the gospel.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.740]   And I kinda read this article and thought,
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.100]   that's really interesting.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:37.940]   To tell you honestly,
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.540]   I think it behooves the Christian individual to decide,
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.500]   what do I do here to glorify the name of the Lord?
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.540]   Right?
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.020]   And that's gonna be really dependent upon,
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:52.100]   like, the context, how the other individual is responding,
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.140]   and what is gonna be the best platform to share the gospel.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:58.780]   But, to repeat,
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.220]   there is a difference between how Christian Christian
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.540]   should relate to each other,
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.580]   as opposed to a Christian non-Christian.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.220]   Yes.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.260]   - So, effeminate is there in the Greek.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:14.260]   It depicts somebody that's,
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:18.020]   the Greek word is defined,
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.220]   soft,
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.900]   uncertain affinity.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.100]   And even, male prostitute.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.620]   The Greek word is,
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:35.700]   it even defines soft linen, soft clothing.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.580]   - Right.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.140]   - It's a girly, effeminate.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:38.980]   - Yeah.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.340]   Yeah, to say effeminate, like, basically,
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:49.820]   anything where, you know how there's a lot of,
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.940]   so, transgender, transvestite,
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.060]   anybody who's cross-dressed,
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.980]   or you can call them drag queens, or whatever you may be,
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.500]   you know, dressing and behaving like another gender
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   than God has created you,
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.620]   that would be under the category of effeminate.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.340]   So, thanks.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.300]   Any other questions?
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.140]   Then let's wrap up.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.460]   I hope you guys have a good time of discussion.
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:17.860]   Part of it, I wanted you guys to have an opportunity
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.540]   to just share personal stories, moments in which,
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.700]   when you had to absorb wrong done to you,
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.740]   how did you deal with it?
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.940]   I think that's an important question.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.740]   But also, any applications that you can draw
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.380]   from the study today would be good, okay?
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.660]   Let's pray.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.220]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.700]   God, as we think about this topic of Christians,
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.940]   taking their brother to the courts,
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.580]   and just wringing them dry,
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.620]   and I pray, Lord, that we will be convicted, Lord.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.540]   You know, truly, how dare we,
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.380]   if we claim the name of Lord Jesus,
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.860]   who emptied himself for us,
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.780]   who sacrificed, who absorbed such great pain,
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.220]   suffering, and the penalty we deserve,
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.460]   how can we who call upon the name of the Lord
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.460]   do that to those who also call upon the name of the Lord?
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.620]   I pray, Father God, that if there is any hint
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:13.620]   of this, I guess, angry sin, this bitter sin in us,
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.380]   I pray, Lord, that you would do the work
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.020]   of thorough sanctification, that we would confess it,
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:21.820]   we would repent of it, and desire to truly adopt
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.300]   into our own hearts a heart of mercy,
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:28.420]   a heart of desire to do that which is best in your eyes.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.620]   God, we might lose in the eyes of the world,
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.860]   we might lose in the definition
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.620]   of what the world esteems as success,
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.660]   but I pray, Father God, that we would always seek
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.060]   to please you, and God, that we would always function
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.460]   underneath what is deemed right and holy
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.860]   underneath our Lord.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.620]   Father, I wanna thank you for our study.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.660]   I do pray that each one of us would continue
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.420]   diving deep into your word.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.100]   God, that our lives would be truly in line with your will,
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.820]   that every decision we make would be made
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.300]   and surrender to your holy purposes.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.860]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
