[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.760]   and that we have absolutely no part in what you've done for us.

[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.520]   even though it's short, that it would just be sincere, Lord,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.200]   that these songs that we sing will be a joyful noise.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.520]   It would be a sweet sound to you, God, and above all,

[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:18.920]   He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures.

[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:49.880]   as shiny as the sun, we've no less days
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:59.360]   to sing God's praise than when we first began.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.840]   Amazing grace.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:16.320]   that saved a wretch like me.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:23.800]   I once was lost, but now am found.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:29.280]   Was blind, but now I see.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:36.960]   All right.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.360]   Well, good evening, everybody.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.600]   I just wanted to start with just a reading of the passage.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.760]   And then I'm going to post up some of the questions
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.440]   that I'm hoping that you guys will discuss amongst yourselves.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:59.920]   All right.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   If you guys can see this, just follow along.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   If not, you can just follow along with your ear.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   For I would have you know, brethren,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.720]   that the gospel which was preached by me
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.520]   is not according to man.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.120]   For I neither received it from man nor was I taught it,
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.800]   but I received it through revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.080]   For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.560]   how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   and try to destroy it.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.520]   And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.640]   of my contemporaries among my countrymen,
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.280]   But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.920]   womb and called me through his grace,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.800]   was pleased to reveal his son in me,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.520]   so that I might preach him among the Gentiles,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.920]   I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.800]   nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.480]   who were apostles before me.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.160]   But I went away to Arabia and returned once more
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.320]   to Damascus.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.000]   Amen.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.320]   So these are the three questions that I
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.240]   would like you guys to discuss amongst yourself
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.200]   for the next hour.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.280]   First, you're going to be sharing your questions
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.480]   and observations from this inductive process.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.160]   Hopefully you prepared something.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.880]   If you haven't prepared, I encourage
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.080]   you to listen more than you do speak.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.280]   The second question in the process of this
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.200]   I would like you guys to discuss is,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.320]   what was Paul's life like before he met Christ?
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.840]   What was a driving force behind his hatred and persecution
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.200]   of the church?
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.520]   That's an important thing to think about.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.160]   And third, what was Paul's calling?
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.600]   And is Paul's being set apart and his being called
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.320]   the same thing or not?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.040]   So you're going to take about 55 minutes,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.560]   but let me pray for us.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.480]   And then we'll reconvene at 8 to 10 on the dot.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.040]   OK?
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.280]   Let me pray.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.600]   Father, we're so thankful that you've
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.280]   given us an opportunity to gather together as your family,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.600]   to study your word, to feed off of it.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.760]   And Lord, we're coming to the table with varying needs.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.760]   We're coming with varying appetites.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.440]   And I pray, Lord, for the hungry that you would feed us
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.000]   and that you would help us to leave here
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.440]   rejuvenated and recharged.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.720]   And I pray, Father God, for just the lost and the hurting.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.000]   Lord, you would minister to your hurting people
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.800]   so that they would know, Lord, that no one is
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.480]   beyond the saving reaches of the gospel of Christ.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.480]   And I pray, Lord God, for the complacent,
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.840]   that the truths of your gospel really
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.080]   would hit the core of our hearts so
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   that every single person that's in here
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:53.120]   would leave here today longing to know more of you.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.600]   And Lord, to apply your truth appropriately in our lives.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.200]   So would you protect this time, and would you guard our hearts,
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.400]   and would you feed us?
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.640]   And we lift this time into your hands,
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.000]   and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.440]   I will see you guys at 810 on the dot.

[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.400]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:00.400]   All right, if I can ask you guys to join me in a quick word of prayer.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.400]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.400]   Let me pray for us.
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.400]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Father, thank you for just allowing us to share in a time of discussion
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.400]   and observation.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:25.400]   And with a meaty passage like this, it's difficult to know exactly what to target,
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.400]   what to hit, what to go over.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:32.400]   So I pray, Father, for every single one of us,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   that you would cause us to leave here just wanting to study your word more.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.400]   And I pray simply that whatever we talk about in the next several moments,
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.400]   it would just whet our appetites.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   And I pray, Father, that you would help me just communicate and articulate clearly.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   And so we pray for your help just to be eager learners and eager students of the word.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   And pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:12.400]   Just by way of review, this is what we've covered so far.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.400]   Okay.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.400]   Why are we saved?
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:28.400]   Faith, works, beliefs, my family, my religion, my tradition, my outward obedience.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   That's not what saves us.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.400]   It's 100% by the grace of God.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.400]   And that's what we looked at over the last two weeks, right?
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, he writes, "I am a Christian solely and entirely because of the grace of God,
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.400]   and not because of anything that I have thought or said or done."
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:00.400]   So his quote is pretty much the graphs here, just in a verbal form.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.400]   Okay.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.400]   In the next five sessions, in the next, almost to November 1st,
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.400]   we're looking at just these two chapters.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   Okay.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   The meaty theology is going to be, you're going to see it in chapter 3 and 4,
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.400]   but this is all setting up for it.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.400]   And there's going to be a lot of questions that are in your minds.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   So here's the thesis in verse 11 to 12.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.400]   Paul's main point in all of this is,
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.400]   "The gospel is not of man, it is completely of God."
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.400]   And that's something just to kind of regularly remember
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.400]   as we're getting into the thick of all of the details.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   The main thrust of this is going to be,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.400]   "The gospel is not of man, it is completely of God."
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   And today we're looking at just God converting Paul
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   from persecutor of the church to the preacher of the gospel.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   So he gives that account.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.400]   In two weeks, we're going to be looking at Paul's first encounters
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   with the apostles of Christ's church.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.400]   And then we're going to spend two weeks in verses 1 through 10,
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.400]   where he actually meets with the apostles,
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   and has a summit.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.400]   And then 11 to 21, it can be pretty confusing.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400]   You're like, "What is going on here?"
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400]   Right?
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.400]   Paul confronts Cephas to his face,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.400]   and actually uses the word, "He stood condemned."
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.400]   That's pretty strong words to the apostle upon whom
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   the church has been built.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.400]   Right?
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.400]   So this is what we're going to be looking through
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   over the next five sessions up until November 1st.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   And I want to take a look at the thesis first.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.400]   Galatians 1, 11 to 12,
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.400]   "For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.400]   is not according to man, for I neither received it from man
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.400]   nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.400]   And here are going to be some overarching, uncomfortable questions
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.400]   that we're going to have a hard time answering,
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.400]   that we're going to be wrestling with over the next two chapters.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.400]   Okay? The first one is,
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.400]   "What makes Paul's direct revelations credible?"
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.400]   Why isn't like a Joseph Smith's revelation
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400]   that he got directly from God,
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.400]   why is that not credible?
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   Like, is Paul going rogue here?
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   Is he Lone Ranger? Is that okay?
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400]   Okay?
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   And is he acting alone?
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.400]   Or is he actually going to Jerusalem to confer?
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   But then what's going on?
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.400]   So that's a weird, uncomfortable question
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.400]   that's going to be a little bit challenging to articulate an answer for.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.400]   Secondly, "Did Paul really need no confirmation or affirmation
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.400]   from the other apostles?"
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.400]   Paul uses some strong language.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400]   "Those men added nothing."
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.400]   Jeez.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]   So he's pretty like brazen.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   Okay?
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.400]   And then in verse 11, he starts out by saying,
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   "I opposed Cephas to his face.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   He stood condemned."
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.400]   What is that?
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   So these are going to be uncomfortable questions
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   that I probably will not satisfactorily be able to answer for you,
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   but that's going to be kind of percolating and just bothering you.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400]   So it's okay.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.400]   So when I get to this chapter, or this passage,
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.400]   the first thing I try to do with this is just memorize it
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.400]   and just let it go through my head.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400]   Okay?
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.400]   And then after I memorize it, I actually will map it out.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.400]   Okay?
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   So this is how I mapped out this section.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.400]   So anything that was related to the gospel,
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400]   I had a lot more in the previous Bible studies,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400]   I would do it in blue.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.400]   And there's this duality of the agency of man,
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.400]   the agency of God, and whatever is touched upon
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400]   whenever Paul touches upon one of those two things,
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400]   I just highlighted it in the green.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   Okay?
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400]   Hopefully you guys can kind of see that.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.400]   And then anything related to Judaism, circumcision, Israel,
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.400]   I did this, I tried to do this for the whole,
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.400]   all six chapters.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   Okay?
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   I would just highlight it in yellow.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   Things related to election, salvation, or calling in the gray.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.400]   And then important grammatical words or like trigger words,
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]   I highlighted that in the red.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.400]   So the first part, the "for I would have you know,"
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.400]   that's almost like Paul saying,
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.400]   "Let me make something very, very clear to you."
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400]   That's kind of a figure of speech.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.400]   So I highlighted that in the red.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.400]   And then after this entire like testimony of who Paul was,
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   he says, "But when God."
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   So that's actually pretty important.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.400]   Because you're seeing a changed man.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.400]   Okay?
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:57.400]   And then Jesus reveals, or God reveals his son to Paul,
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   "So that."
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.400]   The word "so that" in the Bible is very important.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.400]   Because that always gives you a reason why something was done.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.400]   Would you guys, do you guys understand that?
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.400]   So "so that" is super important.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.400]   He didn't just save Paul.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.400]   He didn't just reveal Jesus and Paul.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.400]   He did it for a specific purpose.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400]   And then the significant places,
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   I just underlined it,
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.400]   Jerusalem, Arabia, and Damascus.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.400]   And that's how I map it out.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   And I brought out to the very front,
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:35.400]   I received it, I did not consult.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.400]   Okay?
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400]   Because that's going to be kind of an important overarching theme.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   So that's how I map it out.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.400]   This is not like an exact science.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   Whatever helps you just figure out
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.400]   just flow, follow through the flow of thought.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.400]   This is an exercise that I would encourage you to do.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.400]   So the first thing I want to talk about today
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   is going to be the former manner of life in Judaism.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.400]   And then I'm going to be looking at the "but when God."
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.400]   Okay?
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.400]   And so this might be the only time I actually go into Paul's
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.400]   former way of life
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   with you guys, since this is the first of this section.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.400]   So the first thing I actually did was,
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400]   I copied and pasted
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:27.400]   Paul's autobiographical little accounts of himself.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400]   Okay?
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.400]   I mean, you don't need to be able to read it.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400]   I'm just showing it to you.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.400]   So Philippians 3, 1 Corinthians 15, 1 Timothy 1,
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.400]   these are the things that Paul said about his former way of life.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.400]   And then I highlighted things that were not in Galatians.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   Okay?
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.400]   And then I went through all of the Acts accounts
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.400]   that talked about Paul.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.400]   So he talks about himself when it comes to,
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.400]   he's talking to King Arigarpa,
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.400]   he's giving little accounts of himself.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.400]   So I copied and pasted those,
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.400]   and I just highlighted as much as I could.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.400]   Okay?
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.400]   And what I discovered is,
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.400]   some of the stuff don't line up.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.400]   The timing of certain things don't line up.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.400]   It doesn't mean that's not true.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400]   It doesn't mean it's a contradiction.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.400]   It's just hard to synchronize it.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   And that's okay.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   Okay?
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.400]   And so our temptation is to try to piece everything
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   into these little sections,
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   but you don't need to do that.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   There's a lot of questions that cannot be answered.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.400]   All right?
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   So I do this on my notes,
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.400]   and then I'll highlight for you
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.400]   certain things that Paul talks about
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.400]   in his former way of life
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   that were not written in Galatians.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.400]   He's circumcised on the eighth day.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   He goes by the book.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400]   He's a man of the Gentiles.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.400]   Right?
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.400]   He thought he was in the right.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   He called himself
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.400]   acting in ignorance,
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.400]   acting in unbelief.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.400]   But when he was actually ravaging the church,
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.400]   he would not have said that he was acting in unbelief.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.400]   He would not have said he was acting in ignorance.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   Right?
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400]   So I just kind of highlighted that and read for you.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   And then if I look through the book of Acts,
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.400]   there were certain things that I discovered about Paul
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.400]   that is helpful for me.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.400]   One, he had authority to imprison
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.400]   and sometimes even oversee execution.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.400]   Okay, whatever that means.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   Okay?
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400]   And that happened a lot.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.400]   He ravaged the church.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   That's a very strong word,
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.400]   to ravage a church.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.400]   But that's what he did.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.400]   He spoke and he understood Hebrew.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.400]   Okay?
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.400]   That's significant because it actually gets brought up.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.400]   And then he heard a voice in Hebrew.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   And then Paul spoke to the people in the Hebrew dialect.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.400]   And they're like, "Oh!" Right?
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400]   So he speaks and understands Hebrew.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.400]   He is born and raised in Cilicia.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.400]   If you look at Galatians next week's passage,
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.400]   later,
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   "Then I returned to the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.400]   He goes home
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.400]   where he celebrated.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   So I go, "Huh, that might be of interest."
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.400]   He's educated under Gamaliel from the youth up.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.400]   He has a zeal for God.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.400]   And he's an outstanding Pharisee.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   So these are things that you guys have already probably
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.400]   intuitively gathered in terms of info.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.400]   But it helps to just put it all out on a piece of paper.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.400]   Right?
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.400]   "For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism,
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   "how I used to persecute the church of God
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.400]   "beyond measure and try to destroy it."
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.400]   The first thought I had is,
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.400]   would he have called it the church of God
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.400]   when he was persecuting them?
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.400]   Probably not.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   Paul was acting in zeal,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.400]   in passion,
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.400]   to destroy the church.
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.400]   He was self-righteous.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.400]   And he was trying to just obliterate and wipe out
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.400]   this church
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.400]   for what he thought were noble purposes.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   Okay?
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.400]   And so it makes me just kind of think of a tangential application question.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.400]   How many times do people who say,
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.400]   "I love God, I love Jesus,"
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   but they're like attacking the church nonstop today?
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   One way or the other.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:44.400]   They're acting in,
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.400]   like they believe themselves to be in the right,
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   but they're persecuting the church of God perhaps from within.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.400]   Is that something that some of us in this room are doing?
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400]   So those are thoughts that I have.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   Okay?
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.400]   So in Paul,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   in persecuting the church of God,
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.400]   I just copied and pasted some of the verses
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.400]   that describe it.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400]   Saul was in hearty agreement
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.400]   putting Stephen to death.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.400]   Saul began ravaging the church.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:17.400]   Now Saul's still breathing threats and murder.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.400]   And then Paul talks about himself,
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.400]   "I persecuted this way to the death,
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.400]   binding and putting both men and women into prisons.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.400]   I punished them often in all the synagogues.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.400]   I tried to force them to blaspheme
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.400]   and being furiously enraged at them."
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   That's interesting.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.400]   If I were just to say, "I'm enraged at Daniel,"
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.400]   that's a pretty strong word in and of itself.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.400]   But if I'm like furiously enraged,
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.400]   that's like I'm almost insane.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.400]   Right?
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   So Paul uses very strong words.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.400]   He hated the church.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.400]   And later it says,
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   "Being more extremely zealous."
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   So this guy was a fanatic.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.400]   He was a nut.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   He was passionate.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   Okay?
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   And he was doing it all wrong.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.400]   "But when God..."
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.400]   So that's a very important "but" in the scriptures.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.400]   That's a very important time marker.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.400]   Okay?
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.400]   Paul was running 100 miles an hour this way,
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.400]   and then God redirected him.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.400]   Now he's going the other way.
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.400]   "Who had set me apart even from my mother's womb."
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.400]   That kind of is reminiscent of like how Isaiah,
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.400]   how Jeremiah were like set apart for a specific purpose,
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.400]   right, to preach.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.400]   But set apart just means to fix as a boundary,
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   to determine beforehand.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.400]   Are we set apart?
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.400]   Hopefully you say yes.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.400]   Okay?
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.400]   And then here's a word, "calling."
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.400]   And what is a calling?
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.400]   It refers to the whole complex of events,
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.400]   including repentance and faith,
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.400]   by which a lost sinner is converted to Christ.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.400]   So he is set apart from the womb,
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.400]   and then he is called for the purpose of preaching.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.400]   Okay?
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.400]   So I have a couple verses here that my mind went to,
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.400]   Ephesians 1, 4 through 5.
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.400]   "Just as he chose us in him
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.400]   "before the foundation of the world,"
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.400]   not from even before my mother existed.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.400]   Okay?
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.400]   "From before the foundation of the world
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   "that we would be holy and blameless before him,
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   "in love he predestined us to adoption as sons
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:42.400]   "through Jesus Christ to himself
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.400]   "according to the kind intention of his will."
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.400]   God's election and predestination
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.400]   are hard to argue against in Scripture.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:54.400]   Okay, Revelation 13, 8.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.400]   "All who dwell on the earth will worship him
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.400]   "and everyone whose name has not been written
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.400]   "from the foundation of the world
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.400]   "in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain."
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.400]   So the book of the life of the Lamb who has been slain
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   was written from when?
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.400]   Before the foundation of the world.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.400]   Okay, so God ordained this.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.400]   Okay?
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.400]   So if you've been set apart,
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.400]   you've been set apart from before time began.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.400]   This is what the Scriptures teach us.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.400]   Amen?
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   Hallelujah.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.400]   God, there's nothing that's out of his control.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.400]   And what are we set apart for?
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   Okay, Ephesians 2, 10.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.400]   "For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.400]   "for good works which God prepared beforehand
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.400]   "so that we would walk in them."
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.400]   And so here's the application.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.400]   Be diligent to make your calling and your election sure.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.400]   Right?
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.400]   A lot of the times people get kind of,
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.400]   "Well, if God predestined, what if I'm not predestined?"
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:02.400]   Like, that's a very arrogant statement.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.400]   Okay?
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.400]   While it is still called today
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.400]   and you have an opportunity to repent today,
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.400]   if you hear your voice, do not harden your hearts
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.400]   as your forefathers did in the wilderness.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   So our application really is to make
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.400]   our calling and election sure.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   So I'm going back to Paul.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:29.400]   So I look through just all the Acts accounts
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.400]   and I see that he's converted.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400]   And how is he converted?
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.400]   Saul sees a light from heaven,
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.400]   brighter than the sun it says in some of the accounts.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.400]   He hears a voice.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.400]   Is Paul the only one who sees the light?
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.400]   No, there's people with him.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.400]   Okay?
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.400]   But they don't quite discern the voice.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:56.400]   He hears get up and go on into Damascus.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.400]   Ananias, who's terrified of Paul,
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.400]   God sends him to minister to Saul.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.400]   And then Paul returns to Jerusalem temple,
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.400]   falls into a trance,
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:12.400]   and he immediately gets up after he's baptized,
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.400]   he preaches, and then day one,
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.400]   people are out to get him, to kill him.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.400]   Two plots against his life happen right then in Jerusalem.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.400]   So when Paul says in Galatians,
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   I did not go to Jerusalem,
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   the question I have is like, but he's in Jerusalem.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.400]   Right?
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.400]   Is that a contradiction
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.400]   or is that just a different time marker?
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.400]   So that's a question that I'm going to have in my head
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.400]   over the next several sessions.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.400]   And then do you know who helps Saul get away
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   from the murderer plots?
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.400]   His former disciples.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.400]   And it makes me wonder,
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.400]   I wonder what that conversation would have been like.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.400]   Saul's like, I believe in Jesus.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.400]   And all of his former disciples,
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.400]   there was probably a lot of confusion.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.400]   But they let him down the basket,
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.400]   and then he goes away.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.400]   So there's a lot of stuff,
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.400]   if you actually look through the Acts accounts,
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400]   that give you additional detail
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400]   that will help you when you're reading Galatians.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:14.400]   So Acts chapter 26, verse 16 to 18,
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.400]   "But get up and stand on your feet,
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.400]   "for this purpose I have appeared to you,
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.400]   "to appoint you a minister and a witness,
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.400]   "not only to the things which you have seen,
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.400]   "but also to the things in which I will appear to you."
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   These are the words of Jesus.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400]   "Rescuing you from the Jewish people
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400]   "and from the Gentiles,
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.400]   "to whom I am sending you,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400]   "for what purpose?
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400]   "To open their eyes so that they may see,
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:44.400]   "to open their eyes so that they may turn
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.400]   "from darkness to light,
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.400]   "from the dominion of Satan to God,
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.400]   "that they may receive forgiveness of sins
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.400]   "and an inheritance among those
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.400]   "who have been sanctified by faith in me."
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.400]   So this is Paul's so that.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.400]   Okay?
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.400]   "But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   "and called me through his grace,
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.400]   "was pleased to reveal his Son in me."
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.400]   Like that so that is very important.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.400]   So then I would ask you,
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:17.400]   are you saved?
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.400]   If you are saved,
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.400]   what are you saved for?
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.400]   What is your so that?
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:30.400]   Biblical illiteracy will produce
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.400]   very weak answers to this so that.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:36.400]   I am saved so that I can be in heaven.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.400]   I am saved so that I can avoid hell.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.400]   I have been saved so that I can have a baby.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.400]   I have been saved so that I can have
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.400]   a better life here on earth.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   I have been saved so that my life
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   can have purpose and meaning.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   Is that a biblical so that?
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.400]   What have you been set apart and called for?
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.400]   Is an application question
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:00.400]   that's important for us to think about.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.400]   Okay?
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:05.400]   And one thing that's really cool about Paul,
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.400]   and this is kind of something to keep
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.400]   on the back burner when we were looking at Galatians,
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:13.400]   but by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.400]   And his grace toward me did not prove vain,
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.400]   but I labored even more
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.400]   than all of the other apostles,
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:26.400]   yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.400]   Did Paul work hard?
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.400]   Absolutely.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.400]   Did he work hard to earn righteousness or salvation?
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.400]   No, but the grace of God,
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.400]   which set him apart, called him, saved him,
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.400]   ignited his righteous life.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.400]   And that's an important thought to keep in mind
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.400]   when we're going over Galatians.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   Okay?
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   And then in that like zeal that Paul now has
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.400]   for Jesus and for the church,
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:04.400]   you also see him actually growing in humility.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.400]   So something that's really cool,
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.400]   if you look through Paul's descriptions of himself,
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.400]   1 Corinthians is a little bit earlier
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.400]   when he writes in verse eight,
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400]   he says, "I am the least of all the apostles."
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.400]   In Ephesians 3, eight,
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.400]   which is one of his prison epistles,
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.400]   he actually calls himself,
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.400]   "I am like the least of all the Christians.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.400]   "I am the least of all the saints."
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.400]   And toward the end of his life,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.400]   when he's writing to Timothy,
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.400]   he actually says, "I am the chief of sinners."
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:35.400]   So I think as Paul grows in his faith,
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.400]   he's seeing more and more and more
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.400]   of the depravity that God saved him out of.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.400]   And I find that very, very cool.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:49.400]   I'm gonna just do one little last exercise
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.400]   just for your benefit.
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:54.400]   I like maps.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400]   It helps me kind of mentally
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.400]   to track what's going on where.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.400]   Verse 15 to 17 is just one long verse.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.400]   Okay?
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.400]   But there's some geography that's mentioned here.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.400]   So Paul says, after he got saved,
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:17.400]   he says, so he was in Damascus.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.400]   So I didn't go up to Jerusalem,
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.400]   to those who were apostles before me,
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.400]   but I went away to Arabia,
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.400]   which is a little bit south.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.400]   And then returned once more to Damascus.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.400]   Then three years later,
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.400]   I went down, technically, to Jerusalem.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.400]   So one thing that I observed is,
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.400]   there is no, I ever go down to Jerusalem.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.400]   And I wonder if that's the figure of speech.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.400]   Is it always up?
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.400]   But anyway, he goes to Jerusalem
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.400]   to get acquainted with Peter, Cephas.
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:53.400]   And then later, he goes to Syria, up north,
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:00.400]   and Cilicia, his area of origin and birth and his youth.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.400]   Okay?
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.400]   So that's the wrap up for today.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.400]   It's pretty meaty, it's pretty heavy.
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:11.400]   And my knees are knocking as I'm always trying to prepare
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.400]   the wrap up, I'm like, what do I talk,
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.400]   how do I address this?
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.400]   But hopefully you can make sense of
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.400]   a lot of the things that we talk about in the wrap up
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.400]   as you're plowing through the text yourselves.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.400]   All right?
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.400]   I'm gonna just do a couple of announcements,
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.400]   upcoming events, and then I'm gonna talk about
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.400]   the discussion questions.
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:34.400]   Next week, we don't have Bible study.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.400]   Hopefully you guys knew that.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.400]   Next Wednesday, we don't have any Bible study.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.400]   On Friday at 7.30, we're gonna have
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.400]   our all church praise and prayer.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.400]   This isn't something where like,
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.400]   hey, no Bible study, I get a week off.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.400]   No, this is actually when we wanna make
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.400]   a concentrated effort to gather together
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.400]   to really pray for the needs of the church,
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.400]   for the needs of our members.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.400]   So please do make it a priority to come at 7.30.
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.400]   For you guys who are interested in being members
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.400]   of the church and are not yet,
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.400]   our next membership class will start in a couple weeks.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.400]   And so if you can, do sign up for that through this link.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.400]   For you guys who are aware that
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:19.400]   the Reformation Night is coming up,
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.400]   it's on Tuesday night, October 31st,
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.400]   and we actually do need a lot of volunteers
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.400]   to host trunks, to donate candy,
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.400]   to donate goods and things like that.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.400]   You do have to be a member, okay?
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:36.400]   So please do volunteer if you are able.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.400]   And Sunday, November 19th,
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:41.400]   we are having our regional Thanksgiving dinner.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.400]   But we are right now, we only have enough homes
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.400]   for like just maybe a quarter of our church, okay?
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.400]   So in the event you are willing to,
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   give you a reason to clean your house and stuff,
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.400]   but if you're willing to host a Thanksgiving dinner,
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.400]   we do need more host homes, okay?
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.400]   One last very important announcement.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.400]   Our church, we're having a cleaning and maintenance day
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.400]   on Saturday, October 7th at 9 a.m.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   Refreshments and coffee is gonna be provided.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.400]   If you guys can, right now, check your calendars.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:23.400]   And if you are able to help beautify
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.400]   the facilities of our church campus,
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:31.400]   please go on this right now and sign up for that.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.400]   And I'll give you like seven seconds.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:50.400]   Okay, and then here are the prep questions for September 27th.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:54.400]   It's to read, excuse me.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.400]   Read and inductively prepare.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:06.400]   The last six verse, seven, hairball.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.400]   Galatians 1, 18 to 24.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.400]   And then question number two,
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.400]   what's the significance of Paul's visit with Cephas
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.400]   and the apostle James?
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.400]   One thing you'll discover is that
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.400]   James, the brother of John, was killed in Acts chapter 12.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.400]   This is James, the brother of Jesus.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.400]   He's an apostle?
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.400]   So I'm gonna think through, okay?
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.400]   And then what exactly were the churches of Judea
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.400]   glorifying God in?
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.400]   Don't just write down the verse, here, verse 24,
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:47.400]   and they were glorifying God because of me.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.400]   Like, but what?
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.400]   What was it that they were glorifying God in?
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:52.400]   Okay?
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:56.400]   So for tonight, with the remainder of your time,
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.400]   these are, so usually before we do the Bible study,
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:04.400]   the lesson, a lot of it's giving you an opportunity
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400]   to share the things that you've wrestled with,
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.400]   that you've dug into, that you've examined
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   and explored at home,
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.400]   and now you're sharing with the group.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.400]   And then the wrap up isn't supposed to be like,
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:17.400]   I'm gonna answer every question.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.400]   A lot of it is to tie in, to lead into application.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.400]   And then the follow up discussion is actually
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.400]   supposed to be for a time where you're actually
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   not just studying the text as an academic exercise,
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.400]   but you're trying to figure out,
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.400]   what does this mean for me as a child of God
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:35.400]   to feed off of his word and to submit to his truth?
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:37.400]   What does that mean?
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   And so these application questions
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.400]   are not here to probe into your life,
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:46.400]   it's trying to push you to submit yourselves
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.400]   to the word of God, okay?
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:50.400]   So the first question that I have here
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.400]   is to share briefly about your former manner of life
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.400]   outside of Christ, if you are a believer.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:59.400]   If you're not sure whether you're a believer or not,
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:02.400]   that's fine to share, okay?
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.400]   But if you are a believer,
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:08.400]   explain what your life was like before Jesus.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.400]   How did God call you?
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:14.400]   And then to what did God call you?
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:17.400]   Some of us may have never thought about this question,
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.400]   but what did God call me?
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.400]   Well, duh, the church.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.400]   What is your role?
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.400]   Okay?
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:27.400]   Number two, in what ways are you obedient
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.400]   to the call of God in your life?
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:32.400]   In what ways are you falling short?
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:38.400]   Third, do you have zeal for the church of God?
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.400]   And how do you objectively discern
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.400]   whether you are building up or hurting the church?
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.400]   And what are ways that your group members
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.400]   can stimulate you towards love and good deeds?
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.400]   Okay?
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.400]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll dismiss.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:57.400]   Father, thank you for the joy
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.400]   of just diving into hard texts
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.400]   like we see here in Galatians 1.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:06.400]   I pray that you would give us just insight,
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:12.400]   give us just a heart that just really desires
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.400]   to submit ourselves to all of your truth.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400]   So we pray that as we fellowship,
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.400]   that it will be centered on Christ,
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.400]   that we will be really hedged in by your word and your truth,
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:29.400]   and cause us, Lord God, just to be humble before one another,
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.400]   to be vulnerable before one another,
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.400]   to really love each other,
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:35.400]   and to lift one another up,
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.400]   Lord, for your glory and for our joy.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.400]   So we thank you, Lord, for our time,
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.400]   and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.400]   Amen.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.400]   Amen.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:46.400]   Amen.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.400]   [Silence]
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.400]   [Silence]
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.400]   [Silence]
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:04.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
