[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   >> Good morning, church family.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   We will begin our service by singing "As a Deer."
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And the title of the song borrows from the first verse of
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Psalm 42, which reads, "As a deer pants for the water brooks,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   so my soul pants for you, O God."
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So as we sing this song, let this be our cry and our prayer
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   that we would thirst for the Lord in this way,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and that our God would be our source of life, hope, and strength.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   >> As a deer.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   >> As a deer pants for the water, so my soul longeth after thee.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You're my friend.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You're my friend, and you are my brother, even though you are a
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   king.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I love you more than any other, so much more than anything.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I want you.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I want you more than gold or silver.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Only you can satisfy.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of my eye.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   You alone.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship thee.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   >> All right, welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Our college department is up at the retreat right now, and
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   they're having their service up there, and they'll be down this
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   afternoon, so please continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   First of all, Breen membership class is starting on April 3rd,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   so we are a church that practices membership at the
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   church, and so if you're not a member and you're coming to the
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   church, and we encourage you to participate in that, and again,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Pastor Nate is the one who oversees that, so if you haven't
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   signed up and you're planning to, please sign up for that, and
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that's April 3rd.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   It's an eight-week course from 9 a.m. to 1020 a.m.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   in the Sprouts Room upstairs, so if you haven't signed up for
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   that, please sign up for that.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   The evangelism outings that are happening, if you haven't signed
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   up for that and you want to come and participate, there's three
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   areas where they're going to be going.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   One is the Spectrum, one is at UCI, and the other one is in
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Buena Park, so if you're anywhere in that area, you can
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   sign up and they'll kind of assign you, and then they'll give
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   you some directions on what to do.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   The other thing is, obviously, the Passion Week is coming up,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and so each year when we have Easter coming, we spend that
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   whole week preparing for the Good Friday, where we celebrate
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and remember Jesus' death, and then we have early rise service,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   and then we have the resurrection service on Sunday.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Every year, obviously, it's important, and we want to make
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   sure that we're being very deliberate about the way that
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   we're celebrating so that it would cause us to think deeply
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   about the meaning of it and that we would be affected by it,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   but in particular this year, and I've mentioned this several
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   times before, but we've seen a stirring up of people where
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   people are looking for answers, right?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   What if the nuclear bomb actually does go off?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   What if a third world war does happen?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   What does that mean, right?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's more real to us than it's ever been, at least in our
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   lifetime, for the most part, and so God has created this
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   environment where I've seen more people interested, seeking.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   People who've been going out in the streets have noticed that
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   it's easier to have conversations with people for
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   that reason.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Some of you guys may be aware of it, may not be aware of it,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and so that's something that I believe that God has created,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   you know, something that you and I could have never done
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   through the pandemic and through all the turmoil that we're
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   experiencing, and we want to make the most of that to make
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   sure not only for our own hearts, but that you have family
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   friends around you who may not be Christian, that you've been
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   waiting for the right time to invite them, so as you're
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   coming in, you probably got that card, invitation card for
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   our Easter week and then Sunday to, one, to remind yourself
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   so that you can pray and participate, but also to use
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   that to invite other people to come to service, and so that
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   this Easter in particular, that many people will come, not only
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   to our church, but all around the world, that we would see a
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   revival that correlates with the stirring of people's heart this
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   coming year, and so for that reason, you know, when Passion
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Week happens, every week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   have devotions that take place, you know, tracing the life of
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Christ that week, like Monday, he goes into the temple and he
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   cleanses the temple, Tuesday, he goes in and he does his last
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   public teaching, and then Wednesday, we call Silent
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Wednesday, but that's the time when there's plans being made to
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   turn Jesus over to the authorities and they're going to
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   plan to crucify him, and then Thursday, we have the Passover
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   meal, and so we haven't been able to do that last couple
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   years because of the pandemic, but we're picking it back up,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   so if you, every year, we have a Passover meal that happens on
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Thursday night, and so if you come, especially if you have
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   young children, it's not limited to people who have young
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   children, but we go over the steps and what the meal
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   represents, so when Jesus, before he went to the cross, he
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   participated in the Passover meal, and he says, "Do this in
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   remembrance of me," so what is the "this" that Jesus is
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   referring to? So we go through each of the meal, each of the
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   elements that they participated in, and so it actually reveals
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   quite a bit of what was embedded into the Jewish culture, and
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   so if you haven't participated in it before, I highly
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   encourage you to sign up for that. It is going to be limited
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   in number, and so it's going to be first come, first serve,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   so try to sign up as soon as you can, and once we reach that
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   number, it is going to be capped because we don't want to
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   have more than we can fit into this room, so please sign up
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   for that as soon as you can, and then obviously we have that
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Good Friday service, and we're going to remind you as time
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   goes on, but to really do your best to be sober, and so not
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   just that week of, but that's part of the reason why I'm going
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   through this series and preparing us for Easter, okay?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   All right, so let me pray for us for our offering, and right
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   after the offering, our sister Jessie Kim is going to come
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   give her testimony and be baptized, all right? Let's pray.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance. We pray for the power
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   of the Holy Spirit to wake us up from our slumber, help us to
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   know the spiritual battle that we are in, that we do not just
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   come and go and worship Lord God to check off our religious
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   duty, but teach us, remind us, guide us, sanctify us, Lord
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   God, that we would be people who worship you in spirit and
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   in truth. Help us to love you, honor you, that even in this
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   giving, Lord God, may it be an act of worship to you, multiply
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   30, 60, 100 fold for the sake of your name and your kingdom.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   >> Who breaks the power of sin and darkness, whose love is
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   so much stronger, the King of glory, the King above all kings.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder, who leaves us
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   breathless in all our wonder, the King of glory, the King
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   above all kings. This is amazing grace.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   This is unfailing love.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   That you would take my place.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   That you would bear my cross.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You would lay down your life.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   That I would be set free.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Who brings our chaos?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Who brings our chaos back into order?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Who rules the nations with truth and justice, shines like the
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   sun in all of its brilliance, the King of glory, the King above
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   all kings.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   This is amazing.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   This is amazing grace.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   This is unfailing love.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   That you would take my place.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   That you would bear my cross.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   You would lay down your life.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   That I would be set free.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Worthy is the Lamb.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Worthy, worthy, worthy.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Oh, this is amazing grace.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   This is unfailing love.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   This is unfailing love.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   That you would take my place.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   That you would bear my cross.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   You would lay down your life.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   That I would be set free.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   All that you've done for me.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   When the enemy surrounds and my heart grows faint within.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   When the darkness overwhelms and my fears are pressing in.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I will trust in you, oh Lord.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   In the silence, I will wait.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I will stand upon your word.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   You're my solid rock and my salvation.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   My steadfast hope that won't be shaken.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   My soul will wait.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   My soul will wait for you.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   You're my stronghold and my shield.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   In the midst of every threat, though the wicked never yield,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   they will vanish like a breath.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Yes, I know the outcome's sure.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Satan's evil plans will fail.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   In your power, I'm secure.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   You're my solid rock and my salvation.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   My steadfast hope that won't be shaken.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   My soul will wait.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   My soul will wait for you.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You're my comfort when I feel forsaken.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   My refuge and my sure foundation.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   My soul will wait.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   My soul will wait for you.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   This is love I can't explain.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   This is mercy unreserved.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Through your sacrifice so great, I have peace that's undeserved.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   For the battle has been won, and I fear no shame or loss.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Now the sting of death is gone.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You're my solid rock and my salvation.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   My steadfast hope that won't be shaken.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   My soul will wait.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   My soul will wait for you.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   You're my comfort when I feel forsaken.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   My refuge and my sure foundation.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   My soul will wait.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   My soul will wait for you.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   [MUSIC - "I WILL WAIT FOR YOU"]
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Carrying out our hearts before you, we will trust in you.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Perfect Savior, strong defender, we will trust in you.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Pouring out our hearts before you, we will trust in you.

[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Amen.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   You may be seated.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Hello.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Good morning.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   My name is Jessie Kim, and I'm currently in BAM ministry.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I graduated cosmetology school last year,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   and I recently started working full time.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   So my testimony isn't a big one-time event,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   but there have been multiple milestones in my faith
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   that have led me to where I am today.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   I was born in Korea and moved to Toronto, Canada
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   when I was very young.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I was raised in Toronto for a lot of my younger years,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   but I never really grew up going to church.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I would go once every few months.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   I was always that awkward new girl.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I also grew up moving around a lot.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So every couple years, I'd be in a new house or a new city.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   But the biggest move growing up was to Vermont in grade six.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   It took me some time to adjust, but when I did,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I really loved it there.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And then at the three-year mark, my mom
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   said that we'd be moving back to Toronto.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   This was really hard for me to hear, but on top of all this,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   that year my mom was diagnosed with cancer,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   and we were also living with my grandmother,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   who was suffering with dementia.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   This was a super emotional and dark year for me,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and eventually led to self-harm and some negative thoughts.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And after struggling with these thoughts for a year,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   I was so tired that it led me to pray.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I said, "God, I don't care if you change
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   what happens in my life.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   I just want the will to live."
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And that's all I said.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Gradually, after that night, the self-harming stopped,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   and I prepared for the move.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   So in grade 10, I moved back to this old but new city,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   and that's when God started softening my heart
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and gave me the desire to go to church.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   So I asked my mom to see if there was a church near our house,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and I started attending.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   My parents still weren't going to church at this time,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   so I'd walk to and from church every Sunday and Fridays
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   for youth group.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And at this point, I thought I was able to overcome
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   my struggles because I had a good personality
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   and I was good at adapting to new situations.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   After attending this church for a year,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I went to one of the youth retreats,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   and this is when God revealed to me that it was all Him.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Until this retreat, I totally forgot about the prayer
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   that I said that one night, and I was reminded of that prayer
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and realized my hopefulness, my desire to go to church,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   it was all God working in my life.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   That night is when I learned that God is so real,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   and I repented for even thinking that the past years
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I was able to get through on my own,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   and that He was with me all of those dark nights.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   So the next few years, I started serving
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   and getting really involved at church.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I begged my parents to go on mission trips,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   but they always said no.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   They were okay with me going on Sundays,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   but not spending too much time at church.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Eventually, I graduated high school,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   and they let me go that summer.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   We went to a small Native reserve island
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and spent our time there supporting the missionaries
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   and local leaders.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   This trip is where God taught me how perfectly sovereign He is
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   because everything we planned for that trip
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   completely went out the window,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and our days unfolded as they went.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   During this trip, I learned how I needed the gospel
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   just as much as anyone on that reserve,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and because I was going to church
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   didn't mean that I was saved.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   After I came back home,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   the details of my life started to change.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I grew a desire for the Word,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and I got involved with the campus ministry
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   that following fall.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Since then, I've had to take a few more stops
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   before landing in SoCal,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   but I learned through it all
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   that I don't have a home on this earth.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   When people would ask me, "Where's back home for you?"
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I would always have trouble answering,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and that fact used to make me feel very lonely.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   But now I have comfort that this earth is not my home,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   but I have eternal home with my Father.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Thank you.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   [applause]
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   [indistinct]
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   [applause]
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   - All right, thank you, Jesse, for that testimony,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   especially that last part when she was sharing,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   but she doesn't know how to answer
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   where your hometown is,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   'cause that's exactly how I felt,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   'cause we moved around so much.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   When people say, like, "Where's your hometown?"
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   I don't have one,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   'cause we were in so many different cities
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   during our lifetime.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   But again, thank you, Jesse, for your testimony.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Isaiah 61,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and I'm gonna be reading the first three verses.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Again, starting last week,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   we want to help prepare us for Easter that's coming
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and for receiving the Messiah,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   and we want to look at the hope of the Messiah
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   that was embedded into the Jewish culture,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   and hopefully that as we go through that,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   it would help us to prepare for Christ
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   and what He came to do, okay?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So I'm looking at Isaiah 61.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   I'll be reading the first three verses.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   "because the Lord has anointed me
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   "to bring good news to the afflicted.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   "He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   "to proclaim liberty to the captives
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   "and freedom to prisoners,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   "and the day of vengeance of our God,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   "to comfort all who mourn,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   "to grant those who mourn in Zion,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   "giving them a garland instead of ashes,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   "the mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   "so they will be called oaks of righteousness,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   "the planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified."
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Let's pray.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that Your Word would speak to us.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Sanctify us, rebuke us,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   encourage us, and build us up.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   As You are the potter and we are the clay,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   make us, Lord God, into the image of Christ.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   That these words, Lord, would open our eyes
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   to better prepare our hearts, Lord,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   for the work that You are doing.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   You know, a few years back,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   you know, I started to search the internet
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   to find out, like, when is middle age?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   You know, I, 'cause some,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   it ranges all the way from 40 to mid-50s.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And so I was like, "Mid-50?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   "Like, who lives up to 110?"
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   You know, but, you know, like, whenever that is,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   I was looking it up because I could see,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   you know, people around me,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   some people in their mid-40s,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   some people in their, you know, early 50s
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   kind of wrestling with, you know,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   what is the purpose of life?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And I understand, going through that stage myself,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   I can understand why, especially men,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I don't know, you know,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I don't have personal experience for females,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   but for men, why they go through midlife crisis.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And it's kind of like you're,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   you kind of hit a point in your life
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   where you start to think that the end
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   is much more real than it was ever before, right?
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Not that it's not real in your 30s and 40s,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   but it's much more real, okay?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   So is it going to be another 20 years?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Is it going to be another 30 years?
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   However it may be, it's much sooner.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   We've lived more than we're going to live going forward.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And so when that thought breaks in,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   the natural thought is,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   "What did I do with my life?"
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Right?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Are the things that I've done,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   is this enough?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And so a lot of kind of like soul-searching
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   and maybe even discouragement and disappointment,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   so people do strange things during that period
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   to make them feel like the makeup or whatever it is,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   "I'm just going to do it."
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   I think depending on how much time and effort
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   and energy and money that you spent to build that up,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and when you get disappointed,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   the degree of disappointment is greater.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   So whether that may be,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   maybe some people who came from a difficult family
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   thinking like, "Once I get married,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   "we're going to have a new life,"
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   and then you get married and you realize
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   the same difficulty that you saw when you were young,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   you start to see it in your marriage.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Or whatever that may be,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   maybe in your kids.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   It's like, "Oh, I'm going to make sure
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   "that my kids are going to have this,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   "and they're going to do their best."
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And then time passes by,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   you realize the struggle of just even raising kids.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And so whatever it is that you put time and effort
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and money to invest in,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   and if it doesn't turn out the way that you want it,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   the disappointment that comes in as a result of that.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Now, all the disappointments that I could possibly think of,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   the national disappointment of the Messiah.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I mean, you can't be exaggerated
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   how disappointed the Jews must have been
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   when they thought to themselves
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   that this is not the Messiah that they wanted.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   That the same group that was so excited
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   about Jesus being the Messiah
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   ended up rejecting him at the end of his life
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   when he was headed toward the cross.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   The text that we looked at right now in Isaiah 61 verses 1-3
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   is probably one of the most clearest presentation
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   of what the Messiah was going to do.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   In fact, this is the text that Jesus opens up
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   at the beginning of his ministry.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   He goes into the synagogue in Nazareth
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   right after he comes back down being tested
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   after 40 days of fasting.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   This is the very first thing that he does
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   when he starts his ministry.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   He opens up the text of Isaiah chapter 61
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   and then he reads this text
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and after he reads this messianic promise,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   he said, "Today this is fulfilled in me."
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   He said, "I am that Messiah."
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   So can you imagine the excitement?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   So when he said that,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   some people looked at him and said,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   "Isn't this Joseph's son?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   How could he be the Messiah?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   We remember playing with him."
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Maybe some of the adults said,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   "We remember that kid.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   How can he be the Messiah?"
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And then some of them responded by saying,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   "Man, could he possibly be?"
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   So for the next three years of his ministry,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   they watched him carefully.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Could he possibly be the Messiah?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And everything that he did proved over and over again.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   So you remember when Jesus feeds the 5,000,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   that this stirring of the crowd
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   got to the point where after he fed the 5,000,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   they were going to forcibly make him king.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   And that's why Jesus was trying to escape the crowd
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   because it wasn't time for him.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   But this is exactly the kind of king that you would want.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   If you were to imagine that the king was going to come
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and deliver you from the nation,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I mean, he's humble, he's powerful,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   he's compassionate, he's caring.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   People who had no hope,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   he started giving them hope by the thousands.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   So of course they would want him to be king.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   But that same crowd, one by one,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   begins to turn against him
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   when Jesus began to tell them why he really came.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   "I'm giving you bread,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   but it's not the bread that I came to give.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I'm performing miracles,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   but this is not the reason so that--
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   it's not simply so that the lame could walk."
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   He said, "He performed all these miracles
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   so that I can forgive you of your sins."
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   And once they began to realize
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   that maybe Jesus wasn't going to fulfill their dreams,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   one by one they began to lose them,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and then when he actually went to the cross,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   they said, "Oh, he really is giving his life up.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   He really isn't going to fulfill these dreams."
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   And so that same crowd that followed him for three years
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   rejected him when he went to the cross.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   See, this hope of the Messiah for the king,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   it didn't start just with the nation of Israel.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   In fact, it starts all the way in Genesis.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   In Genesis 3:15, right after the fall,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   God makes this promise,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   "I will put my enmity between you and the woman
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   and between your seed and her seed.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   He shall bruise you on the head,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   and you shall bruise him on the heel."
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And so they called it--the theologians called this
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   proto-evangelium, basically means pre-gospel,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   that God said from the very beginning
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   that he was going to send the seed of the woman,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   and he's going to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   You ever wonder why the Bible is filled with genealogies?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Right? I don't know if you've ever really, like,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   given yourself to study these genealogies,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   but these genealogies are there for a reason.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   They're there because every genealogy
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   is the record of God's fulfillment of this promise.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   So they're connecting that whoever is going to
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   come down this line, that they have a clear record.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   So they teach you, even though we may not fully understand,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   that when the Messiah shows up,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   they can have this record of who he is.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   That's why if you open up the book of Matthew, right,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   the first thing that you see in the book of Matthew
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   is the genealogy, because this genealogy
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   connects Jesus with the promise of the Davidic kingdom,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   with the promise that he made to Abraham,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   the promise that goes all the way back to the creation
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   after the fall.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   But you can understand the disappointment
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   that after waiting for this Messiah to come,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   after not only just hundreds, but thousands of years of waiting,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   that he didn't turn out to be what they thought he would be.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   You see, when Isaiah writes this, the book of Isaiah,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   he wrote it around 722 BC.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   The northern kingdom has already fallen to the Assyrians.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And so he writes this saying that now,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   because of your sin, the southern kingdom,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   is also going to fall.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And so he's predicting that the Babylonians
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   that they were relying on to come and help them,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   they're the ones who are going to take you into captivity.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   And so all the prophecies that are said
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   about the judgment that's coming
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   happens about 140 years after this book is written.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   So everything that he says actually gets fulfilled.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   That all their children get carried on to Babylon,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   and eventually they adjust and they start to live,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and again, you remember reading the book of Daniel,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   and it tells us what their life was like in captivity.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   But it wasn't short-lived.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   After them, the Persians came in,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   and then the Persians, during the Persian reign,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   because of God's work, and as Isaiah predicted,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   King Cyrus comes in and has compassion,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and says he allows them to go.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   But by that time, the Israelites have been so accustomed
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   to staying where they are, only a very small percentage
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   of them come back to build the second temple.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   When they built the second temple,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   the people who remember the first temple were weeping,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   because this could not be the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   How can this be?
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Because the glory of the second temple
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   was nothing like what it was in the beginning.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   But the Bible says that the glory is going to far outweigh
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   anything that they've seen up to that point.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   So the older people realized that this could not be
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   the fulfillment, and it was not.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Their momentary excitement goes right back into despair.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   A couple hundred years later, Alexander the Great comes in,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   and he comes and takes over, and they're under their oppression
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   for a couple hundred years.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   And then after that, the Romans come in.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   And so for over 700 years, they've been waiting,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   specifically for this prophecy to be fulfilled.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   You have to understand what their life was like,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   specifically under the Romans.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   The Romans did their best to kind of keep the foreign nations
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   that they conquered under submission.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And so they gave them enough freedom,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   allowed them to rule their little areas,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   but they also wanted to make sure that everyday life
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   was a reminder to them who the boss was.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   So remember when Jesus tells in his parables
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   and in his teaching, he says,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   "If they ask you to go a mile, go the second mile."
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   The reason why he says that was because there was a Roman law
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   that said if a Roman soldier, as he's walking down,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   and he just gets tired, and he could just ask any Jew,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   he could just ask anybody, even if you're a young mother
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   with small children, if he just got tired, by law,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   they had to drop what they were doing and carry at least a mile, by law.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   And that's why he was saying he's talking specifically
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   to people in that culture that instead of rebelling,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   go the second mile.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   And in fact, if you happen to be very religious
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   and you're going to the temple,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   they set up a statue of Caesar outside.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   So even as you go to worship your God,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   the Romans made sure that every time you went to the temple,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   there was a reminder that our God is much more superior than yours.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And made them bow down to that in order to get to the temple.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   That's the oppression that they were living under.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   And I'm just scratching the surface.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   We could spend the whole Sunday just talking about the oppression
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   that they were under.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   And for 700 years, every time they felt some sort of injustice,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   every time they went to the temple,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   every time a young mother or young man who had to carry
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   all the equipment of the soldiers for a mile,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   they probably reminded each other, Messiah is coming.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   One day Messiah is going to come.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   One day he's going to come, and he's going to do everything
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   that he had promised.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   And so it was that that Jesus came and he read this.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   This is talking about me.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   I'm finally here.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   So you could understand the excitement that they were in.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   And for three years, everything he did was to prove
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   that that's who he was.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   See, there was this longing in the Israelites
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   that I cannot exaggerate.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   The amount of time, energy, tears that went into waiting
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   for the Messiah.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   You know, if you read the Psalms,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   you probably remember at some point in the Psalms,
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   you'll see the term "selah," right?
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   You guys remember there's "selah"?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   If you don't, if you go back and read the Psalms,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   you'll see "selah" just scattered all throughout the Psalms.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   The theologians don't know exactly what that term means.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   There's no exact Hebrew interpretation of that.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   And so some have said that maybe it's a musical thing,
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   like the intermission or maybe a crescendo, right?
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Maybe when you get there, you're supposed to read it louder.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Right?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   Some people believe that.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   I think the common interpretation of "selah"
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   is to kind of take a breather, take a break, right?
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   To read that and kind of pause a second and then to read it.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   I think that what makes most sense is that it's kind of
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   like a sighing.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   It is a break, but it's not simply a break because
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   it's a long psalm and you need to breathe
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   before you keep reading.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   But I believe "selah" basically is a deep sighing.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Like when you're thinking something deeply or emotionally,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   you're affected, you would...
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   (sigh)
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   So the promises of Messiah.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   You know, if you ever studied through the book of Psalms,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   two-thirds of it is a groanings of Israel.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   "Where are you? Why do you let the wicked prosper?"
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Two-thirds of the psalm is in some way
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   is an expression of their pain.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   And so all throughout the book of Psalms
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   is a "selah," a groaning.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   And I believe that's exactly what it is,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   the equivalent in the New Testament is this groaning
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   that the Bible says that the Holy Spirit
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   that's been deposited in us groans on our behalf
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   with words that you and I cannot recognize.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Groaning, sighing.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   The Holy Spirit in us is sighing.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Before we became Christian, the Holy Spirit
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   is groaning to bring us to Christ.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   So in His groaning, justification is the deliverance
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   of the penalty of sin.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Sanctification is the deliverance from the power of sin.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And glorification is the deliverance
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   from the presence of sin.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   And so this groaning inside of us, the Holy Spirit,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   is sighing on our behalf in prayer
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   that we would be justified.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   And in our sanctification, in our wrestling with our flesh,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   in our constant desire to be right,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   and then wrestling with our flesh,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   taking us other places, sighing.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Oh, I've got to struggle with this again.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Again.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Struggling with it again.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Which creates in us the ultimate groaning.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   When will this end?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   When is He going to come?
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   When will we be delivered from the presence of this sin?
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   So I believe that Selah all throughout the book of Psalms
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   is a deep sighing.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Lord, when are You coming?
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   When will You come and answer this prayer?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   When will You wipe away our tears?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   When will You deliver us from our enemies?
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   So this groaning God has placed in their heart
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   so that when the Messiah comes,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   that the celebration would match their groaning.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   See this text that we're looking at in Psalm chapter 61 to 3
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   gives us five things that He promises that I want to review.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   First thing He says,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me."
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   And the point of this is to separate Him from any other king, any other prophet.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Because typically when anointing happens,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   it would be the previous king or the prophet
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   or one of the priests would come and lay hands and anoint Him.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   But He says when the Messiah comes,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   He will be directly anointed by God Himself.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   That God's Spirit is going to be upon Him.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   So if you remember,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   before Jesus reads this text in the synagogue in Luke chapter 4,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   remember what happens to Jesus?
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   He gets baptized.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   Remember at baptism, heaven opens up and Jesus gets anointed
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   and God the Father says, "This is my Son in whom I am in love."
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   And so He was anointed and separated and then He goes up and gets tested.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   And then right after that beginning of the ceremony,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   beginning of the text here,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   He reads it and says, "This is who I am."
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   To be anointed by God means that He was unlike any other king, any other priest.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   That He was going to represent all the authority.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   Not somebody who was going to come and disappear.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Not like Moses, though he was a great leader,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   came and he had his own faults.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Where he was disqualified to even enter into the Promised Land.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Not like David who was a man after God's own heart,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   who did great in the beginning,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   but at the tail end of it he commits adultery and then he even becomes a murderer.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And as a result of that he's not allowed to build a temple and his kingdom gets split.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Solomon comes in, wisest man,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   builds a temple but he chases after the world with all the knowledge that he has.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   And every king that came after them,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   majority of them,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   led the nation astray.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   And the very few kings who were right with God started off well
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   and then they kind of tapered off at the end.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Hezekiah was one of those kings.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   If you were to name one of maybe like four kings that was good in Israel's history,
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Hezekiah would be one of them.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   But remember Hezekiah in chapter 39,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   that at the end of his life,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   he started to align himself with the Babylonians because he forgot who God is.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   See, when he says, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me,"
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   he's saying he's going to be different than any other king.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   God himself is going to be working through this man, this Messiah.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Number two, he said he's going to bring good news to the afflicted.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Some of your translations, they say poor,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   but that is a poor translation of that word.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Because when you say poor, you automatically think financially poor.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   That's not what that word means.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   The word poor basically means those who have been afflicted and hurt and damaged.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   So you could be financially poor, yes,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   but this word carries a much more significant...
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   I can't send that.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   He's talking about people who have been afflicted,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   living under oppression,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   but more specifically, more broadly,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   people who have been affected by sin.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   And that word, euangelion, that the good news, right?
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   And you already know in the New Testament,
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   the word gospel is euangelion, which literally means good news.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   That this one who has been anointed by God is going to come,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   and he's going to be spreading the good news to those who are afflicted.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Every single one of us has been afflicted
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   by your own sins and the sins of others.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   There's not a single person here.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   Some of us may be more aware of it than other people
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   because we live in a fallen world.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   And because we live in a fallen world,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   your parents were fallen, your grandparents were fallen,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   your school teachers were fallen, and you were fallen.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   And as a result of that, there are things that we have said and done
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   that hurt other people.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   And as a result of that, there are things that people have said and done
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   that hurt us.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   So every human being that has been born in this life
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   has been afflicted in one way or another.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   He said he came to bring good news.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   And then he goes on in number three, he says, "He sent me to bind up,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   to literally wrap up those who are brokenhearted."
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   Psalm 34, 18, "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   It's much easier to build community with young people.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   You don't have as much baggage.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   You have this idealism, "We're going to build a community.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   We're going to love each other.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   We're going to raise our children together.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   We're going to take vacations together.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   We're going to open up Sunday schools and build schools."
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   By the time you get to a certain age, it's like, "Yeah, right.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   With who? How do I trust them?"
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Are you sure you want our kids to be friends with those people?
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   It's much harder to build community with older people
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   because we've experienced more of this world,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   of being disappointed, relationships not working out,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   leaders disappointing us.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   And so there's years and years of this kind of got piled up,
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   and so it's naturally easier to be cynical.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   We don't have the same kind of idealism when we're younger.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   That's what happens when you live in a fallen world.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   When I was a young youth pastor, I heard a statistic
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   that one in four girls experience
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   some sort of molestation when they're young, one in four.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   When I first heard that, I couldn't believe it.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   It's like, "Oh, maybe in some other communities,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   maybe in other parts of the world."
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   But through the years, not only has that been confirmed,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   I think it's much larger than that
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   because majority of the abuse that takes place
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   happens within the home because you feel safe.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   And so the things that are reported is one in four.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   So there are many of those instances that are never reported
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   because it's sticky within the family.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   So can you imagine one in four child--
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   and now it's male or female--
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   has experienced some sort of sexual trauma
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   when they were young?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   And I remember trying to counsel through that.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   What can I possibly say to make this better?
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Just praying, like, "Lord, Holy Spirit,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   just bring transformation."
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Reading books, asking for help.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   What can I possibly do?
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   What can I possibly say to counsel them,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   to give them hope?
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   And after years of frustration, I came to the conclusion
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   that the only one that could deliver them from this pain
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   is Christ.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   So the best that I can do is not to have the right words
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   or the system or the accountability or the community,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   is to bring them to Christ.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Every single one of us has experienced
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   some sort of brokenness,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   either directly or indirectly through family.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Christ says he will come.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   Our Messiah is going to come,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   and he's going to bind up the brokenhearted.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   Every single one of these Jews, one way or another,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   have been oppressed for 700-plus years.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Can you imagine the excitement when Jesus says,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   "I am the Messiah"?
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Finally.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Then he says he's going to proclaim liberty to the captives
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   and freedom to the prisoners.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   You know, today, when the president leaves office,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   one of the final things that he does
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   is he uses his authority and power to pardon people
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   who may be in jail and uses his authority to do that.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   Sometimes there's a few.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   Sometimes it can be many dozens of people.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   But in the ancient Near East, the practice was
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   when the king would be anointed,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   and the very first thing that he does,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   he would release the prisoners
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   because he may not be in agreement
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   with the previous king.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Maybe the ones who were supporting him,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   they were the one in prison.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   So it was custom that the people who were desperate to come out
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   would be waiting for the next king to be anointed
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   because that would be the first thing that he does.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   So it is in that spirit, he says,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   "When your king comes, he will deliver
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   all those prisoners who have been bound."
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   That the only hope that they had for the next king,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   the righteous king, to come and deliver them.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   And then he finally says to proclaim
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   the favorable year of the Lord.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   It's clearly, this is in reference to the year of Jubilee
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   that's mentioned in Leviticus chapter 25.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   The year of Jubilee, like in Jewish law,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   every seven years they were supposed to give the land rest
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   in order to recuperate.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   And then the seventh year they would do this again.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   But every seven times seven, after 49 years,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   the 50th year it was declared to be the year of Jubilee.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   Now, I don't have time to go through all of the things
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   that are taught about the year of Jubilee,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   but let me just give you a quick summary
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   of what they were to do at the year of Jubilee.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   He says, "All debts were canceled."
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   Now, if you're in finance, or if you just, you know,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   pay attention to finance, how can this be?
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   All debts canceled?
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   Can you imagine the bankers being stingy?
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   He's like, "Next year's year of Jubilee,
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   I can't lend you that."
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   How can this possibly work?
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   "All land," he says, "number two, was returned
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   to the original owners."
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   So if you leased land, in the 50th year,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   you have to give it back.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   "All the slaves were free, without exception."
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   All slaves were free.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   "Everybody was given a fresh new beginning."
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Now, this sounds good on paper, but how can this possibly work?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Can you imagine what the economy would have looked like
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   on their 49th year?
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Who would lend any money?
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Who would do any business?
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   I mean, but if you were a poor person, it's like,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   "Yeah, I'll take that."
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   Take all the debt.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   See, the whole point of the year of Jubilee
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   was to point to what was coming in Christ.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Just like the cities of refuge,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   like all the amount of money and time and effort
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   that went to build these streets.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   And who used these streets?
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   The people who killed accidentally.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   How many people used these roads?
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   But so much money, time, and effort went into
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   building these cities.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   For what purpose?
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   So that every Jew, when they looked on the cities of refuge,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   they realized when the Messiah comes,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   He's going to build these cities for us.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   So the whole point of the year of Jubilee
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   is to remind us when the Messiah comes,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   this is what He's going to do.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   And so He said, "When the Messiah comes,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   all debt will be canceled.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   All slavery will be set free.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   All the lands, and there's going to be a fresh start
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   in His kingdom."
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Why did they miss this?
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   I mean, they were waiting for this for so long.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   And for three years, they followed Him.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   Who else can walk on water?
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Who else can feed 5,000?
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Who else can tell the storm to stop, and it stops?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Who else can raise the dead?
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   So can you imagine the excitement when Jesus went in
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   to Jerusalem, riding on a donkey,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   because there's a specific prophecy that says
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   that your Messiah, the King, is going to ride on a donkey
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   when He comes in.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   And so Jesus chooses to ride on a donkey
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   to fulfill that prophecy, to make a public declaration,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   "I am He."
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   If any of you had any doubt who I was,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   let this confirm.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   But that rejoicing turned into weeping
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   when they realized that Jesus was actually
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   going to the cross.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   If you read the text that Jesus read in Luke 4, 17-21,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Jesus reads only a portion of this prophecy.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   He doesn't read verse 1, 2, 3.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   He only reads up to the middle of the second verse.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   And He says, He reads, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   because He anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   He has sent me to proclaim the release of the captives
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   and recovery of the sight to the blind,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   to set free those who are oppressed,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord."
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   So if you read 61, that stops in the first line.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   The second part where it says,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   "And the day of vengeance of our God,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   to comfort all who mourn."
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   And then at the end of it, He says,
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   "So that they will," at the end of verse 3,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   "So they will be called oaks of righteousness,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   the planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified."
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   He doesn't read that part.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   And there's a reason He doesn't read that part.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   Because He doesn't fulfill that then.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   There's a second part of that fulfillment
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   that's going to come at the end.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   But His first coming was to fulfill what He says in Isaiah 42.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   In verse 1 through 4, it says,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   "Behold, My servant whom I uphold, My chosen one,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   in whom My soul delights, I have put My Spirit upon him.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   He will bring forth justice to the nations."
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   How many of us think of Jesus' ministry
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   as a ministry of justice?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   We don't.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   We think of it as a ministry of grace,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   compassion, love, gentleness, perseverance.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   And yet, He says He came to bring justice.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   Did He change His mind?
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Did He think that maybe justice isn't what He wants anymore?
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   Well, He describes this justice in verse 2 and 3.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   "He will not cry out or raise His voice,
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   nor make His voice heard in the street.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   A bruised reed He will not break,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   and a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   He will faithfully bring forth justice.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   He will not be disheartened or crushed
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   until He has established justice in this earth,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   and the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law."
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   What justice is He referring to?
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   What is He referring to?
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   The justice that He is referring to,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   the justice that He carried out at the cross.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   He absorbed the greatest injustice.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   The only person who can cry out to His Father,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   "Why have you done this to me?"
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   There's not a single human being
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   that could be in that position
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   and dare to lift his eyes and say,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   "Why have you done this to me?"
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   Because we know why He's doing that to us.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   Because we deserve it.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   We rebelled against Him.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   We've sinned against Him.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   We've sinned against one another.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   So when He does that, when He brings punishment,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   we can't open our mouth.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Only the pure, perfect Jesus
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   can cry out to His Father.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   Because the only person that was deserving
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   of God's love was Jesus Himself.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   So the greatest injustice was absorbed by Christ
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   in order that those with sin
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   will be justified before God.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   That the unjust will become just.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   This is what they did not understand.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   Because they portrayed upon Christ their dreams,
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   every suffering, that when Messiah's come,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   He's going to deliver us from this.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   If you had no legs, He's going to come bring us legs.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   If I'm blind, He's going to open up my eyes.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   If I'm in prison, He's going to release me.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   If I'm poor, He's going to feed me.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   But Jesus said He did all of that
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   to show us that He had authority to forgive us of our sins.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   Because it wasn't because of our lameness.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   It wasn't because of our blindness.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   It wasn't because of our empty stomachs.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   It was because of our sins.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   But they did not understand.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   And as a result, they rejected Him.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   The very person, and the only person,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   that could truly give them life.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   You know, among the Jews, there are four different groups.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   The essence you don't see in the Bible.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   Because they just dropped out.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   We don't want to deal with this.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   We've been waiting for Him, and dealing with the Romans,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   and the Pharisees, and so they just packed up their bags,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   and they went out to the desert and lived in a cave.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   So they don't even know the Messiah came.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   They don't know, because they're out there.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   There's people like that in our generation.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   They've neither rejected Christ,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   nor are they passionately following Christ.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   They're just like, "I don't want to deal with it."
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   And they're just going to live their life.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   That was the essence.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   We don't know much about them, because they're not in the Bible.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Because they're out in the desert.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   And then we have the Sadducees.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   Sadducees were the people who basically had given up.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   It's been 700 years since the promise.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   Maybe this is all just wishful thinking.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   So they were the liberals who had given up.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   There's no angels.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   There's no resurrection.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   There's no miracles.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   The sad thing about the Sadducees
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   were they're the ones who were the leading Israel at the time.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   They were the high priests.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   They were the members in the Sanhedrin.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   So when Jesus goes to the temple,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   it was the Sadducees who were running the temple.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   And that's why the outside, they were selling stuff.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   And people couldn't even worship.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   Because to them, worship was just something that you did.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   It just wasn't important.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   It's not real.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Because they didn't believe that anymore.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   So they were salvaging whatever they had on their face.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   So they were by name a Jew,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   but they didn't believe in any of that stuff.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   If you go to Europe today,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   where Christianity has been for over a thousand plus years,
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   that's exactly what it looks like.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   The leaders of the churches in Europe
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   are people who've given up hope in Christ.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   They don't believe in the resurrection.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   They don't believe that Bible is God's word.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   But yet they still have the signs upon the churches.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   But if you go in, they don't believe in any of that.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   So they're trying to salvage.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   You know what?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   Maybe we can be a good witness.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Maybe we're good citizens and do good stuff
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   and feed the poor and make this place a better life.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   That's exactly what the Sadducees were doing.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   Because they no longer believed in the miracle of God.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   These were the Sadducees.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   And then you had the Zealots.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Zealots were, you know what?
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   He's not coming.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   And I don't know when he's going to come,
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   but we can't wait.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   So we're going to get ready.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   And so they were carrying around knives.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   And these are the guys.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   Remember when Pontius Pilate presented to the Jews,
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   do you want Jesus, possibly the king of the Jews,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   or do you want Barabbas, the Zealot,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   who was caught in the middle of his insurrection
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   to try to challenge us militarily?
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   Remember what they all cried out?
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   I prefer to have Zealot.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   I prefer to have him militarily striking
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   than this man who fooled us for three years,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   pretending to be our Messiah,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   and then he can't even get out of your hand.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   He's actually going to just give in like that?
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   We don't want that.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   Give us Barabbas.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   These were the guys who organized the army,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   and they went to battle with the Romans,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   and they come in, they crush them.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   So AD 70, Israel disappears because of these Zealots.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   The saddest of these groups are the Pharisees
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   because the Pharisees somehow convinced themselves
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   that if they kept the law perfectly,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   that maybe then the Messiah would come.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   So on top of all the laws that they had,
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   they added more laws.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   We're going to do this, and we're going to do that,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   and they practiced it,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   probably better than most Christians today.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   They proselytized.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   They made disciples.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   They gave every little thing that they had,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   they gave to the temple.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   They memorized scripture.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   They prayed and fasted, some of them three times a week,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   because they believed that if they were righteous enough,
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   that somehow God would show favor.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   The whole book of Romans was written
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   to address these people.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   See, the whole purpose of the law
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   was so that you would know why you need the Messiah.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   The whole book of the law was to make sin utterly sinful.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   So at the end of that, you would be surrendered
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   and beating your chest,
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   like the tax collectors and like the prostitutes,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   that whether you are a religious leader
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   or whether you are a prostitute,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   when God is revealed,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   that they will be beating their chest.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   How can I get into heaven?
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   But they fooled themselves to think
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   that if they kept the law
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   and the extra laws that they had,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   that they had a better standing before God.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   And when Jesus came,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   he rebuked them more than anybody else.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Instead of humbling them,
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   the law made them proud.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   And every single one of them rejected Christ
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   because they projected on him
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   what they wanted the king to be.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   See, as we prepare for the resurrection,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   there's a glimpse of this in every single one of us.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   We want him to fulfill certain things.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   Whatever frustration, whatever pain,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   whatever situation that we are in,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   why isn't God answering this prayer?
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   If you would just fix my marriage,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   if you would just fix my kids,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   if you would just fix my relationship,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   if you would just fix my circumstance,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   if you would just fix my business.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   And yet Jesus says,
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   he who finds his life,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   he who lives hard,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   thinking that somehow if you do this,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   that you're going to have a better life,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   he said, we'll lose it.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   He who loses his life for my sake,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   he will find it.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   You see, our inclination to live
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   is what's killing us.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   Our inclination to be successful
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   is what kills us.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   Our inclination to be better than our neighbors
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   is what kills us, is what divides us.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   It's what causes war.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   It's what causes divorce.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   It is until we die.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   And we recognize that life is found in him and him alone.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   We could be blind, just like the Jews.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   And thinking that we're following Christ
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   when we're really following the image
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   that we've created of him
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   instead of the Christ of the Bible.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   So my prayer is that as we prepare ourselves
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   for the Palm Sunday,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   and for Good Friday and Resurrection,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   that it would be an opportunity for us to look deeply,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   not only the Word of God, but our own passions.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   Even as a pastor, even as I preach the Gospel,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   my desire to be somebody can easily creep in,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   and it will ruin me.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   So let's take some time to step back.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   Take the next three weeks to four weeks.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   Before we examine the world,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   before we examine the Church,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   examine our own hearts.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Where are we?
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   Are we truly following Christ?
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   Is there any blindness in me?
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   And then hopefully that will bring revival
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   and refreshment in our hearts as we meet the Lord.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   Father, we come before you needing your grace again and again.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Lord, I know we have brothers and sisters in this room,
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   even now, are wrestling in prayer,
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   dealing with hurt and pain,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   disappointment of living in this world.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   Open our eyes, Lord God,
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   that we may see the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   that our hope will be placed in Christ, in Christ alone.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   Lord, help us, Lord God, to see who Christ is,
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   that the groaning in our hearts, Lord God,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   would cause us to be justified, sanctified,
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   ultimately glorified.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   [MUSIC - "THE GRACE OF GOD HAS REACHED FOR ME"]
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   The grace of God has reached for me
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   and pulled me from the raging sea.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   And I am safe on the solid ground.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   The Lord is my salvation.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   I will not fear when darkness falls.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   His strength will help me scale these walls.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   I'll see the dawn of the rising sun.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   The Lord is my salvation.

[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   My hope is hidden in the Lord.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:13.500]   He flares each promise of His word.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:20.500]   When winter fades, I know spring will come.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   The Lord is my salvation.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:34.500]   In times of waiting, times of need,

[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   will renew these things.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.000]   The Lord is my salvation.

[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:28.500]   And when I reach-- and when I reach the final day,
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.000]   He will not leave me in the grave.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.500]   But I will rise.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.000]   He will call me home.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   The Lord is my salvation.

[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:32.500]   Pray that the grace of--
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:39.000]   grace of God, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:47.500]   the continued perseverance, and the mediator that
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.000]   continues to guide us and lead us,

[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:07.000]   adopted us, promised us eternal inheritance with Christ.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:15.500]   Guide us, lead us, rebuke us, challenge us, encourage us,

[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   cause us to be the light wherever it is that you send us.
