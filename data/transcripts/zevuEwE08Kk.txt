[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.940]   - Good morning, Church family.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.940]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.440]   Scripture says in 1 John 3, 1,
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   that we would be called children of God, and such we are."
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.940]   As we begin our service with the song,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.440]   "You Made Us Your Own,"
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.940]   let us reflect and rejoice in this great love
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.940]   the Father has shown to us through His Son, Jesus.

[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:28.940]   - Well, good morning, church family.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.940]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.940]   If this is your first Sunday with us and you're visiting
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.940]   and you wanna get to know more about our church,
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.940]   we have a table and a booth outside
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.940]   that you can get information on how to plug in,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.940]   get involved, and even just find people
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.940]   who can sit and ask you or answer questions for you.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   So we do have that in the back.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.940]   I have a couple of announcements for us.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.940]   If you have taken the shuttle over here,
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.940]   we may have had a couple hiccups today
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.940]   'cause the golf carts weren't charged.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   So we're still working, we're working out the kinks, okay?
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.940]   But we do have a shuttle system.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.940]   So if you are a healthy-legged
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.940]   and you want to save the closer seat spots
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.940]   for people who are visiting and for young families,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.940]   please do park at the far lots.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.940]   The shuttle system, which launched today,
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.940]   it'll be available for you guys, okay?
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   If you guys are wanting to become members of the church,
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.940]   we are a church that practices membership,
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.940]   and it's an eight-week course,
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.940]   and the next round of the classes starts
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.940]   in two weeks on Sunday, July 9th.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.940]   And so that's a prerequisite for membership into the class.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.940]   If you have any questions, you can email Pastor Nate,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.940]   who's currently in Korea,
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.940]   but you can email him for more information,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.940]   or you could just pull me aside
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.940]   and ask me after the service as well.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.940]   Speaking of the Korea team, they arrived there
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.940]   probably about, like, 25, 30 hours ago,
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.940]   and they had their first full day Sunday.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.940]   It was a worship service.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.940]   Pastor Nate preached.
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.940]   And then starting tomorrow--
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.940]   they're probably sleeping right now--
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.940]   but starting tomorrow, they have a very packed,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.940]   full, busy three weeks,
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.940]   so please do keep them in your prayers
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.940]   and that God would be magnified
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940]   in the country of South Korea
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.940]   as the Christian population is rapidly declining.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.940]   Okay, so please pray for them.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.940]   They'll be back July 15th.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.940]   Okay, so until then, please be fervent in your inner session.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.940]   We have our monthly praise and prayer
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   this coming Friday at 7:30.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.940]   We are going to remove the front chair,
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.940]   so if you guys want to come and just kneel and pray,
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   it's a BYO, like, pad, right,
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.940]   so you can come and--or mat,
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.940]   so you can pray with us today--
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.940]   or on Friday at 7:30.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.940]   And today is the last call
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.940]   to sign up for the All Church Retreat,
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.940]   where we take care of your lodging for you.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.940]   Okay, if you want to sign up afterward, you can,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.940]   but we are running--we're running out of space and time,
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.940]   so please do register for that by today
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.940]   if you're planning to join us
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.940]   and you want to be at the hotel that we're all at, okay?
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.940]   After our time of offering,
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.940]   our brother Brian Lee is going to come and share his testimony,
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.940]   and then he's going to be baptized.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.940]   And if you have your offering--it's a physical one.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.940]   We do have a box in the back.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.940]   You can put that there as you walk out
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.940]   or--and even during the time of offering now,
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.940]   or you can give your tithes and offerings
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.940]   electronically via Zelle, all right?
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.940]   So let me pray for us,
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.940]   and then we'll continue with our worship service.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.940]   Father, we're very thankful
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.940]   that you've just called us your own,
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.940]   and what a privilege it is for us to gather
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.940]   to celebrate our new life in Christ.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.940]   And we acknowledge this morning
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.940]   that this worship service primarily is for you.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   You are the audience.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.940]   You are the center.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.940]   And we pray, Father, that you would help us
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.940]   to engage appropriately
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.940]   to give you the honor that you do.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.940]   And we pray that from the beginning of the service
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.940]   to the very end, Lord,
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.940]   that you would lead it, that you would guide it,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.940]   and would your truth be proclaimed,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.940]   and would we respond accordingly and appropriately.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.940]   Lord, we bring our gifts.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.940]   We bring our tithes and offerings,
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.940]   but most importantly, we desire to offer you our hearts.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.940]   So would you bless our time,
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.940]   and would you receive the glory that you are due this morning?
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.940]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.940]   [music]
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.940]   [music]
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.940]   [music]
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.940]   [music]
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.940]   [music]
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.940]   [music]
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:10.940]   [music]
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.940]   Let us rise as we sing these praises.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.940]   And this next song is called "There is a Fountain,"
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.940]   and the opening line goes,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.940]   "There is a fountain filled with blood."
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.940]   And without context, this can feel like
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.940]   the opening lyric to some death metal band.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.940]   But to the Christian, this is a precious truth
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.940]   to know that the costly and pure sacrifice
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.940]   of our Savior's blood signifies the full pardon of our sin
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.940]   and a restored relationship to our Heavenly Father.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.940]   Church, let us sing this next song together.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:00.940]   [music]
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:11.940]   There is a fountain.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   There is a fountain
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.940]   filled with blood
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:25.940]   drawn from Emmanuel's veins.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:32.940]   And sinners plunged beneath that flood
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:39.940]   lose all their guilty stains,
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:46.940]   lose all their guilty stains,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:53.940]   lose all their guilty stains.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:20:00.940]   And sinners plunged beneath that flood
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:07.940]   lose all their guilty stains.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.940]   [music]
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   Dear dying Lamb, dear dying Lamb,
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:31.940]   Thy precious blood shall never lose its power.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:38.940]   Till all the ransomed Church of God
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:45.940]   be saved to sin no more,
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:52.940]   be saved to sin no more,
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:59.940]   be saved to sin no more.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:06.940]   Till all the ransomed Church of God
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:13.940]   be saved to sin no more.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.940]   [music]
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.940]   Irsitz by faith.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.940]   Irsitz by faith I saw the stream
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   of flowing wounds supply.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   Redeeming love has been my theme
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:52.940]   and shall be till I die,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:59.940]   and shall be till I die,
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:06.940]   and shall be till I die.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:13.940]   Redeeming love has been my theme
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:20.940]   and shall be till I die.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.940]   [music]
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:45.940]   When this poor lisping,
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:52.940]   When this poor lisping, staring tongue
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   lies silent in the grave,
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:06.940]   and in another sweeter song
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:13.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save,
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:20.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save,
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:27.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:34.940]   And in another sweeter song
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save,
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:48.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:55.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:02.940]   And in another sweeter song
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:10.940]   I'll sing Thy power to save.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.940]   [music]
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.940]   [music]
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.940]   [music]
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.940]   [music]
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.940]   [music]
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.940]   [music]
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.940]   [music]
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.940]   When the darkness awakes
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.940]   and my heart is faint within,
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.940]   when the darkness overwhelm
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.940]   and my ears are dancing in,
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.940]   I will trust in You alone.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.940]   In the silence of the night
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.940]   I will stand upon Your throne.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.940]   My solid rock, my salvation,
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   my steadfast hope,
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.940]   my salvation, my soul,
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   my soul, my salvation.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.940]   My soul, my salvation,
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   the best of every breath,
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.940]   no broken heart will win,
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.940]   in the lavish life of breath.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.940]   Yes, I'm not out of control,
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.940]   Satan's evil plans will fail,
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.940]   Your power I'm secure.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.940]   You're my solid rock and my salvation,
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.940]   my steadfast hope that won't be shaken,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.940]   my soul will wait,
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:22.940]   my soul will wait for You.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.940]   You're my comfort when I feel forsaken,
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.940]   my refuge and my sure foundation,
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.940]   my soul will wait,
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:40.940]   my soul will wait for You.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.940]   This is not a fantasy,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.940]   this is mercy on reserve,
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.940]   Your sacrifice so dear,
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.940]   I have peace and love deserve.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.940]   For the battle has been won
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.940]   and I fear no shame or loss,
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.940]   now the sting of death is gone.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.940]   You're my solid rock and my salvation,
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.940]   my steadfast hope that won't be shaken,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.940]   my soul will wait,
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:29.940]   my soul will wait for You.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.940]   You're my comfort when I feel forsaken,
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.940]   my refuge and my sure foundation,
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.940]   my soul will wait,
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.940]   my soul will wait for You.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:10.940]   Going out on arms before You,
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.940]   we will trust in You.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:23.940]   Perfect Savior,
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.940]   strong defender,
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.940]   we will trust in You.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:46.940]   Going out on arms before You,
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:53.940]   we will trust in You.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.940]   Perfect Savior,
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.940]   strong defender,
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:11.940]   we will trust in You.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.940]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.940]   [silence]
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.940]   [silence]
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:53.940]   I would like to first and foremost thank everyone who has helped and taught me to get me to where I am today.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   And above all else, it was all thanks to God.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.940]   As I was growing up, I had a pretty privileged life.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.940]   I had two loving parents, amazing Korean food, and a roof over my head.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   My struggle started when I first came to America at the age of nine.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.940]   I was often the target of bullying, so routinely I ate alone or hid in the bathroom.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:21.940]   I despised how pathetic I was and blamed it on my thick eyebrows or my shallow eczema.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:30.940]   Although I had my parents to turn to, my problems felt insignificant amongst their sea of difficulty and constant hard work.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.940]   I simply repressed it, and the longer I did, the more I truly felt alone.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.940]   I would spend countless nights contemplating whether dying would be less of a suffering.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:47.940]   In the midst of it all, something told me to hold on and place my faith in humanity.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.940]   All I wanted was to fit in, so I decided to pluck my eyebrows, sag my pants, sleep in class,
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.940]   I stole, fought, and left my family as an afterthought.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   With a reputation and friends came a gaping pit of insecurity, a need to please others,
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.940]   and a belief that my value hinged on how others perceived me.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   I kept cultivating a picture of myself on what I believed others would find appealing.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.940]   In retrospect, I realized that life without God is in vain,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:22.940]   and my self-righteousness kept me from seeing the sacrifices given to me.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.940]   Eventually, I landed on a group of friends who I would have taken a bullet for.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.940]   Ride or die, they were the only things that mattered to me, and of course, my new girlfriend.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   However, our friendship of eight years fell apart.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:42.940]   It wasn't the first time I lost my friends, but it still hit me hard because they meant the world to me.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:51.940]   I felt betrayed and stopped seeing the point of trusting people or investing in the empty jar of people.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:32:03.940]   I started to push people away, and inevitably, my pride, anxiety, and gaping insecurities also resurfaced.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:10.940]   In my interaction with people, I frequently let my rage and feeling of disrespect get the better of me.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:19.940]   Drinking before bed was my muse to shut off my intrusive thoughts, and worst one yet, I struck my middle sister.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:30.940]   Not once, but multiple times.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:45.940]   I called her a monster, made excuses for why she deserved it,
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:01.940]   but no amount of good could clean my ass. I was a monster.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:10.940]   To fill the void in my heart, I tried to work on self-improvement in my career, money, and brokenness within my family.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   However, no matter what I tried, I was never able to make up for my emptiness.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:22.940]   When I first came to Berrien, my goal at the time was to make connections and learn about good morals.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   As I continued to attend the sermons and talk to individuals, my curiosity grew about what the truth had deepened.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:45.940]   I knew firsthand, truth is not of this world. There was endless greed in each individual and priority of self-preservation.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   We trust ourselves to make the right decisions in this world. If humans were perfect, as society claims, then no problem.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   I should be able to trust any decision I make, as the results should be perfect.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   But I am an imperfect being who yearns for perfect outcomes, and that is why I ended up empty.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:08.940]   That our soul is not of this world, and I had desires for justice, equality, peace, and love in a barren place.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.940]   I was sick of waiting for my next fix of dopamine, and I yearned for the real truth.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:24.940]   Pascal's wager was enough for me to believe in God that religion was relatively easy to pick.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:30.940]   The one religion that stood above the rest, and that we were saved, Christianity.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:36.940]   That we are not saved through works, but through Jesus Christ. It says so in Ephesians 2, verse 8.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:44.940]   There's no one way, there's no way one can put enough good works in this world to counteract evil.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.940]   I knew that in my head, but my soul did not believe.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:55.940]   Through my hypocrisy, I tried to put in the work to be a Christian, to have equalities and love without Jesus Christ.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:02.940]   No matter what I did, it wasn't enough. I only realized I was at the edge of a cliff when I spoke with Pastor Mark.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:08.940]   Although God was urging me to jump and put my trust in Him, I felt undeserving and was doubting His authority.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:15.940]   I told God, "My sins are too heavy, and let me do some work until I'm qualified enough."
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:22.940]   I was then told by Pastor Mark that our sins are too heavy to be worked off, and I have to ask to be saved.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:29.940]   So we began praying. God unveiled to me that pride was a source of my independence and my reluctance to ask for help.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.940]   He revealed to me how much He loved me, and He would truth me over and over,
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.940]   that He is God, and that I did not become something I'm not just to be loved.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:46.940]   To bring my broken pieces as they are, that night as I broke down and felt the warmth of God,
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.940]   God's love and forgiveness wash over me, I realized that it really was that easy.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:59.940]   Romans 8, chapter 8, verse 31 to 32, helped me understand the extent of His love.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.940]   "What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.940]   He who did not spare His own love, but delivered Him over for us all,
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:14.940]   how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:20.940]   Although sanctification is a process, I was set free of my shackles of anxiety,
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.940]   sorrow, and the fear of death. I have now joy I cannot contain,
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.940]   but I had to question whether I was really believing this,
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.940]   because I found a place where I felt like I belonged, and had volleyball.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:41.940]   I can confidently say that I would still believe, even if I didn't have all those things."
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.940]   Thank you.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:52.940]   [applause]
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:37:10.940]   Brian, do you understand that when you go into the water,
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.940]   you're uniting with Christ in His death, and as you come out, you're uniting with Him in His resurrection?
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.940]   I do.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   As you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   [applause]
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.940]   Thank you, Brian. Just what a joy it is.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.940]   I actually was probably one of the first people to meet Brian at the church,
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.940]   and just to see God's work in his life.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.940]   It really is an encouragement just to see the many people that have prayed for him,
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.940]   that have loved on him, and it is a joy just to be able to baptize him this morning.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:05.940]   If you guys have your Bibles with you, please turn to 1 Peter chapter 2,
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.940]   and I'm going to be reading for you verses 1 through 3.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.940]   1 Peter chapter 2, verses 1 through 3.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:25.940]   It reads, "Therefore, putting aside all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisy, and envy, and all slander,
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:30.940]   like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word,
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.940]   so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.940]   If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.940]   Let us pray together.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:46.940]   Father, we are gathered here to hear your truth,
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.940]   and I pray, Father, that you would feed your sheep,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:58.940]   and may your Word spur us on to worship,
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:06.940]   and cause us to leave here as people who respond appropriately to the proclamation of your truth,
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   and help us, Lord God, really to respond with much affection toward the cross of Christ,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.940]   and that in turn, it would lead us to just love our people.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.940]   And so we thank you for just your provision of this time,
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.940]   and we pray for your protection over the pulpit,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:34.940]   help our minds and our hearts to be both awake and alert and so soft.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.940]   We thank you, God, for giving us this morning,
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.940]   and we pray for just your help to listen well.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.940]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   So as most of you know, I have a twin son and daughter,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.940]   and shortly after we found out that we were having a boy and a girl,
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.940]   and from the moment we had given them names,
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:58.940]   I started praying very specifically for each of the two of them.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.940]   And we named our daughter Keres, which in Greek means gift.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.940]   And from before the time she was born,
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:12.940]   I prayed daily that my daughter would grow up to become a woman with both great zeal for the Lord,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:18.940]   and specifically a heart of compassion for the poor and for the lost.
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.940]   And I prayed that she would become a champion for the orphans and the widows,
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.940]   and that was my prayer for her.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.940]   I mean, I was working for Compassion International.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   I didn't think I would be coming back, but that was my longings for my unborn daughter.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:37.940]   And we named our son Matthias, and in Acts 1:26,
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:42.940]   it's written that Matthias was the one who replaced Judas Iscariot
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   and took his place as an apostle.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:51.940]   And we don't know much else about Matthias outside of that fact that he was an apostle.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.940]   And for some reason, that obscurity really appealed to me greatly.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.940]   And no doubt, Apostle Matthias did his part in the building up of the kingdom of God.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.940]   No doubt, Apostle Matthias bore great spiritual fruit.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.940]   And like Matthias of the Scriptures, I prayed from before our Matty was born
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.940]   that he would become a faithful man of God who loves the Lord, who loves the Word,
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   and who faithfully helps to build the church of Jesus Christ, even if no one knows about it,
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.940]   even if he does so in obscurity.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.940]   And this is how I prayed for them from the time they were in the womb.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:33.940]   And the twins were born just slightly premature, and so they spent a week in the incubator.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.940]   And that week was such a special and memorable time for me personally.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.940]   I spent hours in the NICU every day, and I took turns with each of them,
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.940]   just placing him or her on my chest, and just spending an hour, like, snuggling and kissing
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   and smelling and praying for each of them.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   And the prayers that I had prayed for them while they were in the womb,
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.940]   I prayed again while they were against my chest.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:03.940]   And over the years, we've since developed, like, a bedtime ritual with the kids
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.940]   where we would pray together.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:10.940]   And the contents of my prayer to this day have not changed much.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   And in preparing for this sermon, it kind of dawned on me that my prayers,
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.940]   both for Maddie and Karis, have always been future-focused,
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   that they would become mature, faithful, godly adults.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   And that's the bar that I set for them in my heart.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.940]   And these are my goals for them.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:38.940]   And I pray these things with expectation and with all my heart as their father every night.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.940]   And my job as their father did not end there at the hospital at their birth
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.940]   or when we got their birth certificates to say that they're formally,
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   in the eyes of the state, that they're our children.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.940]   I am their father still to this day.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:43:00.940]   And, Lord willing, my role as their father will continue as I shepherd and guide them into adulthood.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:06.940]   My children are not to remain children.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.940]   I don't ever pray for or hope that my children remain children.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.940]   I want to see them grow up.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.940]   Now, like, for sure, I've said, "Oh, I wish they could stay this way forever,"
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.940]   but I actually don't really mean that.
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:22.940]   Okay?
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.940]   I can't and I don't actually mean that.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.940]   And you may have said it too if you're a parent,
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.940]   but you would be alarmed if your child stopped growing.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.940]   You would be concerned if they stopped maturing.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:45.940]   If at 20 they still acted like they were 5, you would be grieved.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.940]   You would feel as if you had failed them.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.940]   And similarly, children of God are not to remain spiritually childish forever.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.940]   Childlike? Yes. Childish? No.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:05.940]   And in our passage today, the Apostle Peter writes that Christians are supposed to grow.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.940]   There's an expectation there.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.940]   A bar has been set.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.940]   Salvation is not a one-time act.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.940]   We aren't just to enjoy salvation.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.940]   We are to grow up in it.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.940]   We are to go on to maturity.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:26.940]   And as the Spirit of God himself prays for his children with groans which words cannot express,
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.940]   with heavenly expectation,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:35.940]   the spiritual growth of every Christian is expected and inevitable.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.940]   It cannot not happen.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Scripture makes that clear.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:48.940]   A child of God cannot not grow.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.940]   And this growth isn't just passive.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.940]   We are to be active in our pursuit of it.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.940]   In Hebrews 6, verse 1, the author of Hebrews similarly exhorts us saying,
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   "Let us press on toward maturity."
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:08.940]   And we're to be fed, to be trained, and then we are to be pressed toward growth.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.940]   God's children cannot but grow.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:17.940]   God's children must grow.
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:23.940]   Corpses do not grow, but living children do.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.940]   The spiritually dead cannot spiritually grow,
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:35.940]   but the spiritually living cannot but grow into the likeness of their spiritual father.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:41.940]   So we who have the Spirit of God, who have had our hearts of stone replaced with hearts of flesh,
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.940]   we're supposed to press on toward maturity.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.940]   This cannot be stopped.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.940]   It's in your spiritual DNA.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:56.940]   You're either dead or you're alive and growing.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.940]   You cannot be alive in Christ and not grow into his likeness.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:05.940]   That is a theological impossibility.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.940]   Our passage today is from 1 Peter chapter 2,
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:14.940]   and though there are specific situations and specific circumstances
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.940]   that the Apostle Peter is addressing,
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.940]   the bulk of his letter is actually very future-focused.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.940]   The first chapter of 1 Peter begins with the descriptions of the Christian's future,
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.940]   the Christian's bar, the father's expectations,
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.940]   and what the fullness of maturity for the Christian looks like.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:38.940]   So we've studied this last year, so in some ways this is review,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.940]   but chapter 1 is about what the Christian is supposed to become,
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.940]   and let me read that for you.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:51.940]   The Christian becomes more and more of these things as he is sanctified.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.940]   So the first one, he grows in obedience to Jesus Christ.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.940]   He takes ownership of his inheritance.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.940]   He lives a life full of praise and glory and honor to Christ,
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.940]   and he'll continue to do so until Christ returns.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.940]   He is continuing to be saved.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.940]   There's a theological word for this. It's called sanctification.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.940]   So the Christian continues to grow in holiness,
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:23.940]   and as he walks with the Lord, he grows and develops a greater hunger
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.940]   and appetite for the eternal word of God, and all of that is in chapter 1.
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   And that's what the spiritual DNA of every Christian looks like.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.940]   So that's chapter 1.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.940]   And we find ourselves in chapter 2,
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.940]   and I said the first three verses of chapter 2 for us in the beginning.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.940]   And 1 Peter 2 begins with the word "therefore,"
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.940]   and most every "therefore" that we find in the Scriptures is important.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:55.940]   And whenever we come across a "therefore," you have to ask the question,
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.940]   "What is this 'therefore' there for?" Right?
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:06.940]   Usually a "therefore" connects what has just been said with an expected application.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:13.940]   It connects what has just been said with an appropriate response.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:18.940]   So in chapter 1, since the Christian is an heir to a future and eternal hope
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.940]   which is imperishable, unfading, and undefiled,
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:27.940]   he is "therefore," in chapter 2, to conduct himself in the following way in the present.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   And I want to read the first three verses again for you.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   "Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit, and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.940]   like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word,
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.940]   so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:53.940]   So in these three verses, in this passage, there is a condition.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.940]   And in this passage, you will also find that there is one single command,
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.940]   just one single imperative.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.940]   And also in these three verses, there is only one attending participle
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.940]   that describes how the Christian is supposed to obey this command.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:15.940]   And so I'm going to lay out the outline of this passage for you up front.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:21.940]   And the logical flow of thought in this passage, it's in the reverse order to what is written.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.940]   So we're going to be looking at this passage back to front.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.940]   The text makes better sense in our minds if you go from back to front.
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:35.940]   So first, we're going to be looking at the condition, the "if" clause.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.940]   Then we're going to look at the single command, "epipateo,"
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:46.940]   which means to long for or to hunger, to crave the word of God.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.940]   So there's that condition and there's a command.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:55.940]   And at the end, we're going to look at the things that curb the Christian's appetite for the word of God,
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.940]   things that just quench.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.940]   So the outline is as follows.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.940]   The condition, verse 3, the command in verse 2,
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:10.940]   and at the end, the appetite curbs that need to be put aside in verse 1.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.940]   So the condition, I'm going to start with verse 3.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   It reads, "If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.940]   Now, once you've got your physical Bibles open,
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.940]   some of you may notice that the font is different for verse 3.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.940]   So if you have a physical Bible, a newer translation,
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.940]   a differing font in a New Testament passage usually denotes a quoting of the Septuagint,
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.940]   which is the Greek translation of the Old Testament.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:44.940]   And this, verse 3, is a direct reference to the Greek translation of Psalm 34.8.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.940]   And I'm going to read that for you.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:53.940]   "If you will taste and see that the Lord is good, how blessed is the man who takes refuge in him."
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:51:00.940]   In Psalm 34, it seems pretty important to the theology of Apostle Peter,
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:06.940]   because he quotes it here in chapter 2, and then he quotes it again in chapter 3.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.940]   Psalm 34 is written by King David,
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:16.940]   and it describes a man who has been delivered or rescued by Yahweh God.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:22.940]   Psalm 34 describes a man who is completely helpless.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.940]   He is a man who is crushed in spirit.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.940]   He is a man who cries out to Yahweh, his only hope.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.940]   He's in despair.
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:36.940]   And this man, God answers, and He saves him from all his troubles,
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.940]   and he is no longer in want.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:45.940]   And this helpless man in Psalm 34 is then given the title "righteous."
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.940]   And he is called righteous on three different occasions.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.940]   So what makes this man righteous?
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:52:01.940]   What makes a Christian righteous?
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:06.940]   In his utter helplessness, he takes refuge in Yahweh.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.940]   He is rescued and changed by Yahweh.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:14.940]   And having been rescued and changed, he exalts and praises Yahweh.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   He has tasted and he has seen the kindness and goodness of the Lord,
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.940]   and he's been forever rescued and changed.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:27.940]   And the righteousness of the Psalm 34 man is not earned by religious effort.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.940]   The righteousness is imputed to him.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.940]   It's a reward for his faith, not for his deeds.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.940]   This righteous man, he sought and he found.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.940]   He asked and he received.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   He repented and he was made righteous.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.940]   And remember in our first Peter text today, I said that there is a condition,
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.940]   and it reads, "If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.940]   That's the condition.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.940]   So how do we know if a person has tasted the kindness of the Lord?
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.940]   What makes a person righteous?
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   The Bible teaches us that the primary evidence of having experienced the kindness of God is this.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.940]   It's a life lived in genuine repentance.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.940]   A life lived in genuine repentance.
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.940]   In Romans 2, 4, Paul writes,
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.940]   "Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience,
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:26.940]   not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.940]   Repentance is a complete change of mind.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.940]   It's a change of direction.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.940]   It is a walking in the newness of life and in its power.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.940]   It's a turning away from sin and a cleaving to the Lordship of Christ.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.940]   That's the evidence.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:49.940]   2 Corinthians 7, 10 tells us that repentance leads to salvation.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:54.940]   If you've never repented, you've never been saved.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.940]   No matter what experience you might have had,
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.940]   no matter how many years you've been to church,
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.940]   if you've never repented, you've never been saved.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:09.940]   It is impossible for a person who has tasted the kindness of God to live in unrepentance.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.940]   Let me repeat this for you.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:21.940]   It is impossible for a person who has tasted the kindness of God to live in unrepentance.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.940]   Impossible.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:28.940]   The Old Testament prophets all preached repentance.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:33.940]   John the Baptist, the first New Testament prophet, he preached repentance.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.940]   Jesus Christ himself, he preached repentance.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:44.940]   At Pentecost, the Apostle Peter, in his very first sermon recorded ever, he preached repentance.
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:53.940]   The Apostle Paul's entire ministry to the Gentiles could be summed up as a ministry of calling people to repentance.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:55:03.940]   Paul, in detailing his ministry, in describing it, he describes it like this before King Agrippa in Acts 26, verse 20.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:11.940]   "But I kept declaring both to those of Damascus first and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea,
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:17.940]   and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God,
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.940]   performing deeds appropriate to repentance."
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.940]   So repentance in the Scriptures is always measurable.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.940]   It's not a feeling. It's always measurable.
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.940]   It always bears good fruit.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:37.940]   And you cannot have truly experienced the kindness of the Lord and live in unrepentance.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.940]   That is a theological impossibility.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:50.940]   The non-Christian, when confronted with his sin, justifies and excuses his sin.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:57.940]   Blame shifts and then vilifies other people and says things like, "Who are you to judge me?"
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.940]   That's the non-Christian response.
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.940]   The non-Christian is hostile toward the call to repentance.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:16.940]   The Christian, on the other hand, when confronted with his sins, sooner than later, the Christian always repents.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:23.940]   So the primary evidence of having tasted the kindness of the Lord, it's a life of genuine repentance.
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.940]   That's the condition.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:34.940]   So the command in 1 Peter 2, verse 2, it's written to those who have indeed tasted the kindness of the Lord.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:39.940]   A non-Christian cannot obey this command.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:46.940]   So, if you've tasted the kindness of the Lord, the command applies to you.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:53.940]   So, to the Christian, the Apostle Peter writes in verse 2,
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:57:01.940]   "Like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.940]   if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:10.940]   So here in verse 2, we find the only imperative, the only command in this entire passage.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:16.940]   Some scholars actually say that this is the central command of the whole book.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:19.940]   If you miss it, you miss the point.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.940]   It's the central command.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:26.940]   "If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord, long for His Word."
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   That's the command.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:33.940]   The word "long for," it's pretty intense.
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:38.940]   It's like an intense, insatiable desire, an obsession, or a passion.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.940]   That's the word.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:48.940]   It actually has been used in Greek to talk about a newly wedded husband's longing for his wife.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:56.940]   It's used to describe the longings for a deceased loved one that you might have.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:05.940]   You're grieving, and you're obsessed with just sadness because you're longing for the deceased loved one.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:16.940]   It's also used in Greek literature to describe a parent who has lost his child, or a child that's gone wayward.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.940]   Someone who is longing in this way has a one-track mind.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.940]   He's obsessed.
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.940]   He cannot think about anything else.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.940]   He is fixated on this one thing.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:39.940]   Here in chapter 2, verse 2, it is used to describe a baby's single-minded focus, his obsession, his hunger for milk.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:48.940]   "If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord, if you've been made righteous, if you have had your heart of stone removed and been given a heart of flesh,
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:56.940]   long for the word in the same way a newborn baby longs for milk."
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.940]   That's a command.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:04.940]   A Christian must long and will long to be fed by the pure spiritual milk of the Word.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.940]   Here it says, "You are what you eat."
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:12.940]   More specifically, in the context of our passage, "You are what you crave."
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:20.940]   A baby bird will long for a bug, or perhaps even a worm.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.940]   It's in the baby bird's nature to do so.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:35.940]   A baby fish--you might learn something new this morning, I googled this yesterday--a baby fish will long for microorganisms called infusoria.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.940]   Baby butterflies.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.940]   What's another word for baby butterfly?
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   A caterpillar, right?
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.940]   Caterpillars, they're passionate about leaves.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:52.940]   We have at our house a theologically very rich book called "The Hungry Caterpillar."
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.940]   If you have time, check it out. Theologically rich.
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:04.940]   Baby snakes will long for insects, small amphibians, and even rodents.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:10.940]   A baby snake is hardwired to go after a rodent, even right after it's hatched.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:20.940]   A baby human will long for and scream his head off until he gets his milk.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.940]   He doesn't need to be taught this.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   Baby humans are born hangry.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.940]   If you guys are a parent, you know.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:35.940]   It's not like a "Oh, I want some milk." It's not like that. It's like "Ahhhh!"
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.940]   Especially at 3am.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:44.940]   It's hangry for milk. That's how he's been designed.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:49.940]   A baby human will not long for a bug.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:54.940]   Or will be satisfied with a rodent, even if you puree it.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.940]   It will not want it.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.940]   A baby human cannot digest infezoria.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.940]   It cannot digest leaves.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:11.940]   What does a human baby long for? Milk.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.940]   What does a child of God long for?
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.940]   What is he hardwired to crave?
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.940]   What is his base root desire?
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.940]   The Word of God.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:29.940]   It's in the spiritual DNA of every Christian to long for the pure milk of the Word.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:36.940]   Being born again, you've been hardwired to long for it.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:46.940]   A child of God who has tasted the kindness of the Lord will not be satisfied only with community,
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:53.940]   comfort, success, strong morals, a sense of purpose, good praise music,
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:02:00.940]   encouraging words of affirmation from people who boost self-esteem, belonging.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:05.940]   All of those things are good things, even though I make faces. They're all okay.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.940]   But a child of God will not be fed on those things.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:15.940]   He doesn't long for those things.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:23.940]   A child of God can only be satisfied with and will long to feed off of Christ and His Word.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:30.940]   For a person to call himself a Christian and have no hunger or longing for the pure milk of the Word
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:36.940]   is holding on to a theological impossibility.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   It's wishful thinking at best.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.940]   It is not in the Bible.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.940]   This kind of faith is not anywhere in the Scriptures.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   That's actually not even faith. That's superstition.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   It's biblical illiteracy.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:04.940]   So that kind of a person who's at church, who serves, but has no craving for the Word of God
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:10.940]   is literally allergic to sound doctrine.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:16.940]   The non-Christian cannot handle the pure milk of the Word.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:22.940]   The non-Christian will be repulsed by the pure milk of the Word.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   It will actually disgust and offend him. He will spit it out.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.940]   If you quote the Word of God to a Christian, even if it's painful, they'll be like,
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.940]   "You know what? You're right. Amen. I just don't like how you said it."
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.940]   But a Christian, or non-Christian, you quote him the Word of God, they'll be like,
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:45.940]   "Don't quote the Bible at me. Don't judge me. Who are you?"
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:53.940]   That's the non-Christian response when the Word of God is confronting the person's sins.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:01.940]   The genuine Christian will always reflect, "Is that me? Is this God's voice?"
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:07.940]   Some of you guys have recently done little experiments and have hatched chickens and duck eggs at home.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.940]   It's all over Instagram. You know who you are.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:19.940]   I'm absolutely certain you didn't give those chicks or the ducklings little shots of milk.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.940]   You'd be a fool if you did that. That's a waste of milk.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.940]   As a baby bird and a baby human long for and are satisfied with different foods,
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:36.940]   the cravings and the longings of a non-Christian differ greatly from those of a Christian. Amen?
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.940]   You guys understand that? Are you tracking?
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:44.940]   Now, for the great many of you here today, you know you are at a Bible church.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.940]   And you know that the church holds the Word of God in high regard here.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.940]   We value Bible study here.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.940]   So you might just be nodding along and saying, "Amen," almost instinctively.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:01.940]   "Amen? Amen." Right? You did that because I said to. Right? That's what happens.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:07.940]   You may think you agree with everything that I've just said about a Christian's appetite for the Word,
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:13.940]   but I want to briefly caution you by pointing you to a couple sobering examples
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.940]   of what could be mistaken for the longing of the Word of God.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:27.940]   Being intrigued and fascinated and entertained by good preaching is not necessarily a longing for the Word.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:34.940]   You can enjoy good preaching and still have zero longing for the Word.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   I'll give you an example. There's a guy named Herod in the Scriptures.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.940]   Mark 6, verse 20. He's a king.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:48.940]   "For Herod was afraid of John, knowing that John was a righteous and holy man.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.940]   And so Herod kept John safe.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:59.940]   And when John preached, when Herod heard him, he was very perplexed.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:04.940]   But he used to enjoy listening to him.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:11.940]   When John the Baptist told Herod to repent, he was so intrigued, but he put John in prison.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:19.940]   Herod later put John the Baptist, his favorite preacher, to death.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:27.940]   Enjoying and being moved occasionally by Bible teaching is not the same thing as longing for the Word.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.940]   You can be moved to tears by a good sermon.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:39.940]   But remember, worldly sorrow still brings forth death.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:47.940]   An eagerness to learn lots of things about the Bible may not necessarily be a longing for the Word.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.940]   You can be puffed up with a lot of knowledge and still remain unchanged by it.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:07:01.940]   You can enjoy the process of inductive Bible study, be intrigued with the process of just learning through the pages of the Scriptures,
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.940]   and still not long for the Word.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:12.940]   You can search the Scriptures and land on correct doctrine and still have zero relationship with Jesus Christ.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   Knowledge of the Word and acknowledgement of doctrinal truth, sometimes they masquerade as a longing for the Word.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:28.940]   The Pharisees and the demons are two groups that serve as examples of this, and I want to show it to you.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:36.940]   John 5, verse 39 to 40, you search the Scriptures because you think that in those Scriptures you have eternal life.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:44.940]   It is these that testify about me, and you are unwilling to come to me so that you may have life.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   James 2, verse 19, this is written to a bunch of monotheists.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.940]   You believe that God is one.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.940]   You do well.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.940]   The demons also believe.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.940]   Oh, and they shudder. They know better than you.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.940]   So what is a longing for the pure milk of the Word?
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.940]   I'm going to describe it here as a process.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.940]   It's going to be provided for you on the note, so you don't need to try to scramble to write everything down.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.940]   It is a list. It's not exhaustive.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:17.940]   But someone who longs for the Word of God looks like this.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:22.940]   First, those who are his children desire his voice.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.940]   They know his voice, John 10, 27.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:31.940]   And that desire produces faith in his children, Romans 10, 17.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:38.940]   These children then believe eagerly and are zealous to put the Word into practice and to obey, John 14, 15.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.940]   And this is not a struggle.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.940]   It doesn't burden the children.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.940]   It's the perfect law of freedom.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:49.940]   It liberates them, John 8, 32, John 1, 25.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.940]   The truth has set them free.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:56.940]   And then the Word of God continues to abide in those who are his children, John 15, 7.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:05.940]   And then the Spirit guides the Word onto the heart of a believer, and he guides them into all truth, John 16, 13.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:14.940]   And then the Word of God sanctifies the children, so there is like a marked, visible, tangible evidence of holiness, John 17, 17.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:26.940]   And these children persevere through all kinds of rocks or thorns or sunlight, and they bear fruit, 30, 60, 100 fold, Mark 4.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.940]   And then these children no longer satisfied just with milk.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:37.940]   They start craving meat, solid food, Hebrews 5, 14.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:46.940]   And that implanted Word produces Christ-like love in these children, 1 Corinthians 13.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   That's an evidence.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:55.940]   If you are knowledgeable about the Scriptures but you have no compassion for people, I don't think that's a longing for the Word.
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:08.940]   True biblical literacy, a greater longing for the pure milk of the Word, always results in humility, terror, holiness, and great love.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:21.940]   True biblical feeding and literacy always produces in a person humility, terror, holiness, and love.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:26.940]   There is a zeal to know God and not just to know a lot about Him.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   So over time, the spiritual baby grows to look more and more like his spiritual daddy.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:43.940]   If with the passage of time, you don't resemble God, the explanation is not complicated at all.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.940]   He's not your daddy.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:56.940]   If you've been a Christian 20, 30 years and you are no more like the person of Jesus Christ than when you made that altar call profession,
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.940]   He's not your daddy.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   His DNA is not in you.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:09.940]   And you are devoid of the Spirit no matter what your subjective experiences might tell you.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.940]   It is a theological impossibility.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.940]   So are you longing for the pure milk of the Word?
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.940]   Who's your daddy?
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.940]   Who do you resemble?
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:31.940]   So how does the Christian long for the Word as a newborn baby longs for milk?
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.940]   And this is a command.
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:37.940]   And the commands in the Scripture are meant to be obeyed.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:44.940]   And the tricky thing about this command, "long," is not a command that we can just obey on cue.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.940]   Right?
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.940]   Be hungry.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.940]   I don't know what to do with that.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:12:01.940]   So if I were to command you, "Thus saith the Lord, uninstall Netflix from your phone," you can apply.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:10.940]   If I were to say, "Hey, next time you exit the MacArthur exit off of the 55 and there's a homeless person there asking for money, give him $5."
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.940]   "Thus saith the Lord."
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.940]   Those are very specific commands and they're pretty clear.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:22.940]   And then it would be more of an issue of whether or not you want to obey, but those are easy to apply.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:27.940]   But if I were to tell you right here, "Be thirsty."
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.940]   How would you apply that?
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:35.940]   Or if my wife were sitting right there and I said, "Hey, babe, miss me."
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.940]   You know what she would say? "Go away."
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:43.940]   Literally. That's the only way.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.940]   If you were to take a cup of water, I would say, "Be thirsty."
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.940]   And you took a cup of water and drank. You didn't obey that command.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.940]   You just tried to figure out an application just to appease your guilty conscience and get me off your back.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:01.940]   That is not an obedience to the command.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:14.940]   What I find fascinating with this command, "Too long," is that this is one of the few imperatives in the scriptures that are almost obeyed passively.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:18.940]   Almost instinctively.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:24.940]   This is a command that can be actively shrugged off or disobeyed.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:32.940]   But this obedience to this command actually will come naturally.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:36.940]   "Be hungry."
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.940]   Basically, that's what's being commanded here.
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:48.940]   It will come naturally, but it's not something that I can necessarily immediately obey on cue.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:54.940]   But I can obstruct and I can disobey by obstruction.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:00.940]   My spiritual hunger, my appetite for God's word can be curbed.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:08.940]   So in order to be appropriately hungry, my appetite must be saved.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:15.940]   That's why I tell my kids at 3 o'clock when they ask for Pringles, I said, "No. Save your stomach."
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.940]   I'm kind of weak-sauce, so they'll get the Pringles.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.940]   And then my wife complains, "How come you guys aren't eating all your food?"
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.940]   And I just stay quiet.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:27.940]   But the appetite can be curbed.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:32.940]   In order to be appropriately hungry, my appetite needs to be saved.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:43.940]   And we see the Apostle Peter instructing the Christians of Asia Minor to put off, lay aside, or abstain from the things that curb spiritual appetites.
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:51.940]   So the Apostle Peter in verse 1, he starts out with a mini list of things that believers must put off, put aside, or abstain from.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.940]   Too long for the pure milk of the word.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.940]   So I want to read the passage again for you.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:03.940]   "Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies,
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:09.940]   long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.940]   if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.940]   Now let me ask you guys a question.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:24.940]   If you were to assess the things that rob your spiritual appetite of its hunger and its zest, what are those things?
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:30.940]   What are the things that obstruct your longing for the word of God?
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.940]   Verse 1 gives a list, right?
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:38.940]   Malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander.
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:44.940]   When I think of the things that curb my spiritual appetite, things that kill my hunger for the word of God,
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:49.940]   these are not the things that are on my list.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.940]   Think about that with me, right?
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.940]   Are they on your list of things that curb your appetite for the word of God?
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:01.940]   Here in Orange County, when we think of stuff that takes away our hunger for God,
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:10.940]   aren't they things more related to like entertainment, lust-related struggles, materialism, rat race, right?
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:20.940]   Where would malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander rank on your list of curbs?
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:24.940]   Entertainment, lust, ambition, materialism, for sure.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:30.940]   They obstruct an individual's longing for the word of God, and they ruin individuals.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:37.940]   But in this list that Peter provides, malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander,
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:43.940]   those are things that destroy communities.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.940]   Peter exhorts us to be like newborn babies, plural.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.940]   The command "too long" is written in the second person, plural.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:55.940]   It is not written for individuals, but for the entire church body.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.940]   In fact, every "you" in this entire section is all in the plural.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.940]   All of you grow up. All of you long.
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:09.940]   And put aside this stuff that curb your desires.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:15.940]   The list of things that Peter mentions can destroy an entire community's longing for the word of God.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.940]   The sins listed here tear through and ruin churches.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:26.940]   And Satan's favorite and most effective strategy has always been--he's not that creative, he's just efficient--
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.940]   it's always divide and conquer.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:38.940]   Malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander, they divide and ruin relationships and churches.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:47.940]   And these are the things that our collective body here at the church need to glean from this passage.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.940]   These are the things that we need to be mindful of.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:54.940]   Because this is not about you, it's about all of us.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.940]   Are you guys tracking along?
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:01.940]   For some context, we're going to need to understand what these churches of age and minor were encountering.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.940]   In this period of time, the Christians, they were known as followers of the way.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:10.940]   They were very misunderstood, they were persecuted, and often viewed as troublemakers.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.940]   And I want to just point you to some passages, Acts 19.9.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   "But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the way before the people,
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:23.940]   he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus."
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:25.940]   Acts 19.23.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:30.940]   "About that time there occurred no small disturbance concerning the way."
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.940]   Acts 22.4, Paul describing his former way of life in Judaism.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:40.940]   "I persecuted this way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons."
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:45.940]   So there was confusion as to what the followers of the way really believed.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.940]   And what their gatherings really entailed.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.940]   The early church was very exclusive.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:59.940]   You were denied access and entrance into the church if you were not born again, if you were not baptized.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:05.940]   So people on the outside looking in had some misconceptions of the followers of the way.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.940]   Some thought that Christians were a cult.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:14.940]   And in their cultic meetings, they engaged in homosexual practices because they do Philadelphia too?
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.940]   Brotherly love? That's so weird.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:26.940]   Some people thought the Christians in their gatherings practiced cannibalism because they ate their leader's flesh.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   They drank of his blood.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.940]   That's a weird religion.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.940]   They didn't have Google.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.940]   Those are the things that they heard.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   Some viewed Christians as traitors to Rome.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.940]   Some viewed Christians as insurrectionists.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:43.940]   Some viewed Christians as primitive and backwards.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:56.940]   Some entire economies, like that's written in the first Thessalonians, in Macedonia, were ruined because all Christians were boycotting all idols.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.940]   Christians were very easy scapegoats for society's woes.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.940]   They were seen as meek.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:12.940]   So when they were captured and arrested and their leaders were thrown to lions for sport and hoisted onto stakes to light the streets of Rome,
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:19.940]   panic and confusion and fear struck a lot of congregations.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:26.940]   But for some reason, nonetheless, by the power of God and the grace of God,
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:35.940]   the Christian groups kept growing and multiplying and expanding so that the leaders were stretched.
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.940]   The leaders were strained.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:50.940]   That's why later in 1 Peter 5, he says to the shepherds, "Shepherd the flock of God, overseeing it not out of compulsion but willingly, with eagerness."
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:54.940]   I know you're being strained.
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:21:04.940]   So imagine being part of a community that's always being slandered, being mistreated, heavily persecuted, and even executed as a group of people.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.940]   Christians were despised.
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.940]   They were hated.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:18.940]   They did not always feel like a 1 Peter 2, 9-12, a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:23.940]   Why is this happening if God is in control?
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.940]   That's why this is written.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:30.940]   Peter had to remind them of their identity, so I'm going to read the rest of this passage for you.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:37.940]   "So that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.940]   Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:43.940]   You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:49.940]   Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts."
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.940]   And he's not talking about entertainment and pornography.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.940]   You know what he's talking about?
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:59.940]   Desire for action, vengeance, retribution.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:08.940]   "Abstain from these lusts which wage war against your soul, and keep your behavior among the Gentiles excellent,
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:19.940]   so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds as they observe them, glorify God on the day of visitation.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:27.940]   When you are mistreated, ridiculed, beaten, and scorned, when we see our values maligned, let's say on social media,
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.940]   no doubt there is a temptation for malice."
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940]   Malice, the Greek word is kakia.
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:38.940]   It's an all-inclusive word meaning like a desire to harm or to exact retribution.
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.940]   It's a desire to fight fire with fire.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.940]   And some of you guys have that.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:57.940]   But Peter says that malice in this group can curb the group's longing for the pure milk of the Word.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.940]   The next one on the list is deceit.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:06.940]   There is a possible temptation to lie, to escape harm.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:13.940]   When there is animosity toward Christian groups, when there's animosity at the workplace or at schools,
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:25.940]   there may be a temptation to just kind of tell half-truths, to wiggle away, to downplay, to deceive.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.940]   Hypocrisy is the next one.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:38.940]   The church is supposed to be known to be a holy, living, members are supposed to be above reproach, full of love, no matter what the circumstance.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.940]   Members in the church of Christ are supposed to be free of hostility.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:43.940]   They're supposed to be united.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:49.940]   But in difficult situations, when you feel wrong, when you feel hurt, when you feel offended, what happens?
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.940]   It's not always easy to practice what we preach.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   Hypocrisy, too, curbs the longing for the pure milk of the Word.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.940]   Envy. Some of you guys struggle with envy.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:09.940]   But the envy that Peter is talking about is Christians envying how non-Christians have it so easy.
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.940]   There's no persecution on them.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.940]   They can be materialistic. They can be worldly.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.940]   They don't have to take up their cross daily and to follow.
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:24.940]   Man, in some ways, it would be nice not to be a Christian.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:32.940]   Galatians 6.12 talks about how people actually are trying to twist the Scripture so they won't be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.940]   And slander.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:41.940]   And there's a lot of that among some of you here in our church.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.940]   There's all kinds of slander.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:50.940]   Crises, intense times can often divide a family or a group or an organization.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:55.940]   If things don't go your way, the first instinct is to blame the leadership.
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:59.940]   And you slander the motivations of the leaders.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.940]   And then you slander other people.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:06.940]   You're like, "Yeah, he's doing this. Oh, she's doing that."
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:16.940]   And when we are disappointed or hurt by people or frustrated by one another, we badmouth and slander.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.940]   Malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:30.940]   These five things obstruct a community's longing for and proper proclamation of the pure milk of the Word.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.940]   The command here is to long for the Word.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:39.940]   And the application for the whole of our church is to weed out these five things.
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.940]   And when you weed out these five things, guess what happens to the Word of God?
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:48.940]   There's an insatiable desire in all of its members.
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:51.940]   The longing is then unobstructed.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:58.940]   So the primary exhortation that this passage leaves us with today is not that we all individually grow better to become like better Bereans.
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:04.940]   That is, of course, implied, but that's not the passage.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.940]   Every single one of us here needs to grow.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.940]   Every child of God is important.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.940]   Every saint is important.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.940]   And every member needs to individually long for the milk of the Word.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:23.940]   So if you're not doing well and you are a Christian, I'm going to come after you because you are important to this body.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:28.940]   Like if you guys are parents, which of your children can you most do away with?
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.940]   Which of your children is least important?
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.940]   Which of your kids can you sacrifice?
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:38.940]   I only have two, so it's easy, one or the other.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:43.940]   But which of you guys, if you have multiple kids, are willing to just let one go?
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.940]   No, every sheep in the fold is important.
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.940]   But this command is for the church body.
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:27:06.940]   And I am my brother's keeper when it comes to trying to help you flee from malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:11.940]   1 Peter 2, 1-3 is not a note to the individual believer.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:13.940]   It's to the community.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:18.940]   And as a community, we do need to be diligent to obey.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.940]   Amen?
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:24.940]   Let me close with this.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:33.940]   I'm going to backtrack a little bit into 1 Peter 1, so that you can better see the context of the three verses we looked at this morning.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:43.940]   "Since you have, in obedience to the truth, purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:52.940]   For you have been born again, not of seed, which is perishable, but imperishable, that is through the living and enduring word of God.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:57.940]   For all flesh is like grass, all its glory is like the flower of grass.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:03.940]   Grass withers, and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:06.940]   And this is the word which was preached to you.
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:14.940]   Therefore, putting aside all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisy, and envy, and all slander, like newborn babies,
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:20.940]   long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may all grow in respect to salvation,
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:26.940]   if indeed you all have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:32.940]   Our second vision, and our four-fold vision, is to equip every saint with the inerrant word of God.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:44.940]   We cannot do that if our church is full of malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander.
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:55.940]   So, in order for us to properly feed off the word, let's join together and get rid of those things.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.940]   Amen? Let's pray.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:06.940]   Father, help us, especially those of us who are struggling,
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:12.940]   especially with relationships, with fear, with insecurity, with doubt.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:16.940]   If we have tasted the kindness of the Lord, I pray that you would draw us near,
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.940]   and remind us of our identity in Christ.
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:25.940]   And I pray for the people in here that do not have a relationship with Christ,
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:29.940]   even though they have a strong interest in Christianity,
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:35.940]   I pray, Father God, that you would reveal yourself to him or to her,
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:40.940]   and that you would shine brightly in that person's changed life.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:45.940]   Lord, we need your grace, especially as the church gets bigger.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:52.940]   People become more sinful as there are more sinners gathered.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:30:01.940]   So we pray for your help, so that nothing will mar the proclamation of your word in our lives and in this church.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:06.940]   To you be the glory. We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:11.940]   Let us rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:26.940]   [music]
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:39.940]   For my waking breath, for my daily bread,
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:47.940]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:57.940]   For the sun to rise, for my sleep at night,
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:07.940]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:12.940]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:17.940]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:21.940]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:27.940]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:33.940]   [music]
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:44.940]   Where the spirit leads, as I follow,
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:53.940]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:32:03.940]   For the victors still that front of me,
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:17.940]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:22.940]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.940]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:32.940]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:36.940]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:41.940]   Be my all, my treasure, my prize.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:46.940]   I'm yours forever, you're mine.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:52.940]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:59.940]   [music]
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:09.940]   When I pass through death, as I enter rest,
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:17.940]   I depend on you, I depend on you.
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:27.940]   For eternal life to be raised with pride,
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:37.940]   I depend on you, yes, I depend on you.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:42.940]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:47.940]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.940]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:56.940]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:01.940]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:05.940]   Be my all, my treasure, my prize.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:10.940]   I'm yours forever, you're mine.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:15.940]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.940]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:24.940]   Be my all, my treasure, my prize.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:29.940]   I'm yours forever, you're mine.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:35.940]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:45.940]   Lord, would you help us to long appropriately
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.940]   and really to respond appropriately in worship,
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.940]   in kindness, in sacrificial love,
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:56.940]   in great humility, and in holiness,
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.940]   so that this world would know that we indeed are your disciples
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:05.940]   by how we love one another and how we live our lives,
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:08.940]   so that on the day of visitation, Lord,
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:13.940]   that even the Gentiles and the nonbelievers would give you the glory.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.940]   And we pray, Father, that you would strengthen us,
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:19.940]   equip us, empower us, and cause our fellowship
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.940]   that arises from this service
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:29.940]   really to just please you and to exalt and magnify Christ.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:35.940]   and love of God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.940]   be with each and every one of us
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.940]   who has indeed tasted the kindness of the Lord,
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.940]   now and forever. Amen.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.940]   (piano music)
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:50.940]   God sent his Son
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:55.940]   They called him Jesus
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:00.940]   He came to love
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:05.940]   Heal and forgive
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:16.940]   To buy my heart
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:26.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:31.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:41.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:46.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:51.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:56.940]   He lived and died
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:01.940]   He lived and died
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:06.940]   He lived and died
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:11.940]   Just because he lives
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.940]   (music fades)
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:18.940]   (music fades)

[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:24.940]   (music fades)
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.940]   (music fades)
