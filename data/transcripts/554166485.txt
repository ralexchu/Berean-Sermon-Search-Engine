[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Hi everyone, my name is Tyler.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.040]   I'm a second year student in the college ministry, Casa de Long Beach, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.720]   Growing up, I was born and raised in a Christian household and was blessed with the opportunity
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.960]   to hear and learn about God at such a young age.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.540]   I served in the church, went to Sunday school, and checked off all the boxes on the outside
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.600]   on what it looked like to be a Christian.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.080]   But in reality, I had no desire to know God, and I lived a life for my own selfish desires,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.980]   especially when I wasn't at church on Sunday mornings or Friday night youth groups.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.280]   My focus was on worldly things with people that I don't even know remember who I am today.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.040]   I was a people pleaser and did whatever it took to make it seem like I fit in with the
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.140]   rest of my peers.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.640]   This would cause me to live a life for myself and live a life full of lies.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.000]   This life full of sin caused me to never be able to see what the Lord had desired for
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   me.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.580]   Throughout this whole time, I attended church without a heart for the Lord, even though
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.080]   I said and did the things to make it seem like I did.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.520]   I had a lot of head knowledge of who God was through Sunday school, Bible stories, but
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.920]   did nothing to apply it to my own life personally.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.880]   I did this for my whole life heading into high school, and at this time, transitioning
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.240]   into high school was really tough for me as I went to a small high school where none of
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.160]   my peers from middle school went to, and I felt like I had no friends there.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.600]   That whole year, I felt lonely and felt like my life was purposeless at the time.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.200]   I would come home every day from school, lock myself in my room, and lock up God and the
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   rest of the people in my life away from me.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.920]   I had no confidence in myself for at least the first half of my freshman year, and I
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.880]   even considered ending it all.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   During this time of loneliness, I felt God's comfort and the love from the witnesses in
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.120]   my life that never gave up on me and cared about me deeply.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.560]   I was overwhelmed by His love, and one night I cried out to the Lord in prayer, realizing
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.040]   that I wanted and needed Him in my life.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.480]   The Lord pulled me up from the depths of my sin, and it is only by His grace that He opened
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.760]   my eyes to see Him for who He truly is.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.480]   My eyes were opened, and in December of 2016, I was sprinkled at my home church.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.920]   Even after this event, I continued to struggle with sin and my obedience to the Lord as I
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.160]   tried to hold on to sin with one hand and God with the other.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.880]   I continued to try and live a life as my peers did the rest of high school, and those influences
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   transformed my heart to be hardened and unable to fully surrender myself to the Lord.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   The summer of senior year heading into college, I realized that I needed to let go and fully
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.160]   surrender myself to the Lord and really sacrifice everything in my life that I truly idolized
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.680]   and desired, and so I did.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.240]   Ever since then, throughout the trials and tribulations, the Lord continues to work in
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.760]   my life to shape me into the person He calls for me to be.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.160]   Luke 6:46 says, "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?"
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.720]   Today as an act of obedience, I'm getting baptized so that I may be raised with Christ
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800]   in His death and resurrection.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840]   Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that God causes all things to work for good, to those who
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.440]   love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.960]   The Lord continues to provide for me in times of uncertainty and has blessed me beyond what
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.600]   I could ask for.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.680]   God is good, and I realize that sometimes that good isn't always what I want, but it's
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.160]   what I need in my life, and I need God.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.680]   Christ is Lord over my life no matter what happens, and I will continue to live a life
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.160]   for Him in full obedience and with full surrender to Jesus, who is Lord over my life.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160]   Thank you.
