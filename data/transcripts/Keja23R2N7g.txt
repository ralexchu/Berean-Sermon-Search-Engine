[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Okay, so I wanted to introduce somebody. This is an incredible story of a turnaround of a business
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.800]   that impacts a lot of us in America, if you care about climate change, etc. His name is Jim
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.080]   Latinsky, and here's a guy who had all the success in the world, running a hedge fund successfully.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.760]   A business called Molly Corp goes into bankruptcy. He basically puts his entire fund in it, brings
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   it out of bankruptcy, manages to build one of the first mines that was completely cleared. You heard
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.200]   what Elon said about California. In California, that mine some of these rare earths and critical
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.440]   metals that we need to make permanent magnets that we use in electric motors, on the front lines of
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.360]   climate change, building factories now in South Carolina with GM, etc. So Jim's just going to walk
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.120]   you through a few things, and we're going to talk about some climate change stuff after this.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:20.560]   Hey everyone. So I'm Jim. I used to run a hedge fund, and now I'm an accidental industrialist.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.560]   So I want to take you through that journey, and then while I do that, we'll go through the
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.240]   problem that I'd like to solve. Just to provide some context, so I think if we think about a lot
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.880]   of the things that just came up with respect to the economy, it's been about a decade plus since
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.720]   the global financial crisis. And in that decade plus, we've been in this environment where there's
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.840]   been essentially a full-on boom. A lot of money printing, and essentially a very low or negative
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.360]   cost of capital in growth in technology. And what we've seen now, I guess we're on the beginning
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.320]   stages of the aftermath of experiencing that economic enema, as was just discussed. But
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   we have just been through this period of over a decade where there's been all this money that has
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.240]   gone to growth. And what has happened during that time simultaneously is the real economy
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.520]   has been starved. You haven't seen, I doubt many of you have friends that are investing in new
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.920]   steel mills or aluminum mills or nickel mines, maybe nickel mines now, right? But while the real
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.840]   economy has been starved, actually interestingly, we haven't noticed it so much. One, because we're
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.120]   just starting to scale into electrification, but China's made investments. So pretty much all of
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.320]   the incremental steel and aluminum and commodities capacity in the world over the last decade has
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.440]   come online because China has led the way. And as an aside, interestingly, about 80%
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.080]   of the aluminum and 80% of the steel production in China is done with coal. So not only has this been
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.280]   -- not only have they sort of taken over the real stuff, and this isn't about -- wherever you are
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   on the spectrum of are they just a really tough competitor or is this some kind of economic
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.440]   World War III, it doesn't matter. What matters is that the incremental stuff in the real world has
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.880]   really -- the way has been led by China. And so when we think about what's now happening in the
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:43.760]   world as we electrify, I want to move on to the next one here. I think one good thing about going
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.320]   after Elon is I don't have to really explain this chart. We are electrifying. And as we electrify,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.840]   what a lot of people might not fully understand is that while all this real stuff has come online,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.000]   the Chinese have actually moved downstream very intelligently. And so when we think about a lot
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   of people may have heard of China 2025, but a lot of people probably haven't heard of China 2035,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.080]   which is the current MO, which is to move downstream into standardization. And so actually
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:25.520]   when we look around the world today, four of the top ten OEMs are Chinese by global battery electric
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.440]   share. And so when we think about the single largest private employer in the country, the auto
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.560]   industry, we think about all these industries that are mineral intensive, the Chinese actually
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.000]   have moved downstream. And these are very mineral intensive industries. So what this slide shows
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   is as we go from a fossil fuel world to an electrification world, which we all -- I think
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.800]   everyone in this room believes is fake complete. And this actually excludes steel and aluminum.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   Just in the content of copper, nickel, lithium, and then what I focus on, rare earths,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.040]   and some of these other things, there's seven times as much content. And so when we think about
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:22.240]   the past of the fossil fuel driving geopolitical gamesmanship and power in the world, the future
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:31.840]   is about minerals. And what I focus on are rare earths. And so I'm going to get to my journey as
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.800]   an accidental industrialist in a minute. But what you can see here is rare earths,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.400]   they're kind of the way to think about it is sort of like a young cousin of semiconductors
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.320]   to the EV business. So regardless of how electrification happens, regardless of battery
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.360]   chemistry, how that energy gets to a motor, that motor moves via magnets. And so this industry is
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.560]   expected to explode. And it's not just EVs, it's wind turbines, drones, robots. Can anyone actually
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.640]   guess where this robot is from? This is actually from short circuit, Johnny number five, but I'm
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.600]   hoping Elon will get us a better robot of the future. But when we think about all these industries,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:26.320]   magnetics, it's really powerful. So that's where I'm focused. And this is just an example of the
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.760]   commodity needs as we electrify. If we take those projections of what's going to happen in
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   electrification, just in my space, so this is NDPR, this is the stuff that we make, the input
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:44.720]   into magnetics, you can see there's a huge deficit that is looming. And it's moving on.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.480]   Look at my space, here's the challenge. So outside of us, this entire supply chain
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:58.480]   is essentially domiciled in China. And it doesn't even have to be nefarious, but what happens when
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.360]   the largest manufacturers in the world are all competing for what I showed you on that prior
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.400]   slide, a shortage of supply. And we've seen lots of headlines, whether it's the semiconductor issue
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.720]   or just today there was a headline that Rivian is fighting with a supplier over seat costs.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.120]   All of these things where we're seeing the shortages in the supply chain that are flowing
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:29.360]   through. If there's an allocation of materials and the materials are controlled by China or
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.920]   another geopolitical rival, which downstream businesses do we think are going to get those
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:42.400]   materials? And this is actually now an existential issue for all of us. So back to my story. So this
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.840]   is Mountain Pass. This is the mine Chamath mentioned that we bought this out of bankruptcy
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:55.440]   in my fund. So going back about five years ago, this site went bankrupt. It was a public company,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.360]   it sort of, it rose and then it fell. And nobody believed that we could compete against China. And
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   in fact, I had to, we showed up, I showed up in the Delaware courthouse steps. I mean, it was
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.680]   literally like out of a movie, there were other creditors pushing to send this thing into bankruptcy.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.440]   And you look at this thing and you're like, wait, this is the, one of the most valuable
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.400]   rare earth materials mines in the world. And this is the future. This is a material for
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.600]   electrification and no one wants it. Not only does no one want it, but people think that actually we
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.400]   can't even produce here economically because the Chinese have taken over the industry. And so we
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.160]   actually kicked in a couple million dollars just to keep it in care maintenance, just to keep the
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.360]   eight employees on site going so that this thing could actually keep its permit through the bankruptcy
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.800]   because otherwise they were just going to raise it to the ground. So we went through that journey
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.040]   and we ended up buying it. And so these assets, this is about $2 billion of replacement costs,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:00.000]   not to mention the fact that this is one of the marquee sites in the world and it's in a stable
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.120]   jurisdiction. All of these assets up over here to the left, these are what make it environmentally
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.160]   friendly. So we don't put anything back into the water supply. We have dry tailings, which
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.120]   essentially means that for sure we're the cleanest rare earth operation in the world. If you go onto
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.040]   YouTube, you can kind of see how historically some of that mining and processing is done,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.880]   but no one wanted it. And everyone thought that this couldn't be done, but we bought it out of
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:31.440]   bankruptcy. We took on, it was sort of a distressed turnaround and startup at the same time. We had
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.640]   no accounting software. We literally had eight people in a mine and I show up, I'm a hedge fund
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:44.720]   manager and people thought I was pretty insane. And probably if I knew what I was getting into,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.800]   like I said, it was an accident. No, but I couldn't believe that no one else wanted to do
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.480]   this. And I, frankly, I felt as an American, somebody had to do this. And there I was on the
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:02.560]   courthouse steps. And so I went for it. And fast forward to today and we're now public. We went,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.240]   as Chamath mentioned, we went public a couple of years ago. We're a $6.5 billion market cap.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.600]   It's been, you know, obviously a massive, thank you.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:17.120]   So this has been a massive home run for myself and my investors, but more importantly, I,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.240]   and I don't belittle that ultimately we're capitalists here. We want to do a great job for
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   our clients and ourselves. But I hope that we can kind of contextualize this for what needs to happen
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.760]   throughout our economy. Because I do think that as painful as the adjustment may be that we're
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:41.440]   now in this period that we're about to be in with, you know, some of the, as the capital comes out of
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.960]   the growth space, there is going to be a big, beautiful bull market in real stuff. And it is
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.640]   just beginning. And I can, I'll give some statistics with the besties. I don't want to ruin
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.200]   my besties time. So I'm going to finish up real quick. But there's a lot of stuff that needs to
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.760]   get built. And this supply chain stuff is existential. And so what we're doing at MP,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.720]   you can see our stage one we're doing. We just reported our quarter a couple of weeks ago. We're
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.680]   now from a site four years ago that I had to beg on the courthouse steps just to keep it alive.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:20.080]   We're now doing approximately 450 million of run rate EBITDA today. So, you know, and then
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.000]   we announced a deal. We announced a deal with GM where after actually have already broken ground at
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.800]   a magnetics facility in Fort Worth, Texas. And this is a scale deal. It's non-exclusive. We expect
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.760]   to bring in other OEMs where we'll be making magnets. So we'll be shipping material that will
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.560]   be environmentally produced from Mountain Pass, California over to our site in Fort Worth and
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.560]   make magnetics. And our goal is to build a Western magnetics champion. And so I guess with all that,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:52.480]   I would say, hopefully this kind of thing can inspire you. We need, the good news is there
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.400]   needs to be a lot more stuff like this. Maybe I'll share some stats on, you know, some of the other
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.520]   space, because I don't want to make this just about rare earths. But when we think about all
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:05.600]   the materials that we need for this electrification boom and the supply chain that needs to be built,
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:13.280]   this is like, this is the era of, it's as if it's, you know, the 19 teens and Ford is just out. I
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.920]   mean, there is an entire supply chain and it's not just EVs, it's wind turbines, it's drones,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:24.960]   it's robots. And it needs to be a bunch of real stuff that we all create. And so I don't think
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.920]   some percentage of us don't need to necessarily debate whether crypto is going to go up or down.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.680]   You know, now's a time to pivot, I think, because this is something that we need to do
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:42.080]   to get competitive again. So I guess with that, I'll flip the mic and feel the fire from the besties.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:52.560]   Thank you. Tesla in their quarterly earnings said something to the effect of, you know,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.600]   we're going to consider becoming a mining company as well. Right. And then I think Elon said
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.560]   something on the earnings call, which I thought was really interesting. He's like, I encourage
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.400]   every entrepreneur out there to get into lithium, please, you know, become a lithium miner. Right.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:16.960]   So maybe if you can just quantify for us, and you showed the gap for your, for NDPR,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.680]   but broadly speaking, lithium and all the other things that we need to actually electrify and
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.640]   get to a reasonable place in climate change, how behind the curve are we really?
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.360]   So it's a great question. And the data is tough, because a lot of it is reliant on battery
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.480]   chemistry. And so we don't know exactly how much nickel it'll be, how much, you know, but we do
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.080]   know certainly lithium, nickel, copper, all of these things, it's multiple. So we need here's
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:49.120]   actually maybe this is a great stat. Some good source that I utilize estimated that we probably
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:56.560]   need on the order of 40 to 50 copper and nickel projects over the next couple decades. So call
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.960]   it roughly $200 billion of CapEx to satisfy the demand for electrification that we have over the
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.720]   next couple decades. And what's so interesting, you mentioned, and obviously, I assume Elon sees
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   this is if you look at the multiples, you know, just think about it from a strict investor point
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.040]   of view, from a financial arbitrage standpoint, look at the multiples of where auto OEMs trade,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.680]   or, you know, certainly Tesla, and then look at what's happening in the mining industry today. So
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.480]   so actually, the nickel industry is dominated by essentially Glencore and Vale. Those two
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.000]   businesses and I'm not you know, I'm not pitching stocks, but as an investor, you know, we'll see
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.920]   what the next penalty, those two businesses right now at today's commodities prices, are essentially
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.760]   going to free cash flow themselves out in three years, time to buy and they're buying back stock,
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.120]   right. And so this is how how stark the arbitrage is that in the real economy, mining and materials,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.760]   companies, steel companies are trading a double digit free cash flow yields, they're buying back
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.920]   stock, they have no leverage in their businesses. And then downstream, everyone's relying on them.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.760]   And upstream, these guys, they don't want to spend to build out new capacity, because the
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.640]   cost of capital is too high. So what's going to happen is I think you're going to see maybe an
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.320]   AOL Time Warner moment, and I don't mean it the negative way. But I think you could see a Tesla
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.480]   or someone like that buy upstream into these industries, because ultimately downstream,
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.520]   they all realize that the real stuff is in shortage. And you can't have the enterprise
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.960]   value downstream. Because it's like musical chairs, how much of your night, when you're sleeping,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.880]   do you think there's an x percent chance, I'm going to have some huge environmental catastrophe,
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.440]   like part of I think why a lot of folks, you know, folks like this, who could probably go
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.400]   into that business, don't is in the back of their mind, they think, man, this is like,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.640]   this is a lot of gnarly stuff, if something goes wrong, how do you manage that risk? And how,
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.320]   how big is that risk? If we try to do this in America, so the single most important thing we
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.200]   do at MP is safety. And we actually, in our last earnest call said, you know, last two years,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   we've had two years without a lost time injury. And we gave everybody every single employee
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.640]   in the company a cash bonus to celebrate that milestone, which is really critical.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.160]   The reality is this isn't software, right? It's real stuff. All we can do is our best. I just
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.520]   think I think, frankly, as as a human being, as an American, I would rather have mines being done
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.400]   in America, even in the state of California, over elsewhere in the world, where I certainly know
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.680]   that I assure you that nickel mining in Russia is not as environmentally friendly as it is in Canada.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   Well, I think most people may or may not know this. But for example, all of the, you know,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.640]   cobalt that goes into a lot of these EVs, a lot of it comes from DRC. And if you go and see the
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.400]   state of governance in DRC, women's rights in DRC, child rights in DRC, they're non existent.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:48.080]   And so it is a very, very complicated, dirty supply chain that feeds the beast. And even though you
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.840]   may think you're doing the right thing by, you know, driving this plug in hybrid or you know,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.720]   your Toyota Prius, if you trace that stuff back, it's a really complicated place.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:03.280]   I think we've all gotten a big education on supply chain over the last two years with COVID.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.000]   And the value may be of redundancy. And what happens if you give a dictator a little too much
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.840]   power? I think the Germans are learning a hard lesson about what happens when you shut down
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.520]   nuclear reactors and decide, hey, let's buy our let's buy our energy from Putin.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.400]   Well, it's a great point you raised about the Germans, because I think it's a fair analogy to
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:30.000]   say that Germany is to knack gas as we are to China supply chain. And so we see we see this
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.240]   coming, right? We see and again, this is this geopolitical leverage. Yes, it's a national
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.520]   security issue. It's a national security. It's a democracy. It's a democracy issue.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.440]   Is it a war issue? Is it something that gets to the point where we would have to go to war? If,
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.840]   for example, we didn't get the natural resources and critical elements we need? Not that you say
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.320]   that it could not it would happen, but could it happen where it's so important that all these
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.080]   other countries can electrify and and? Well, how about this? I'll make a prediction. I'll bet that
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:09.040]   in the next five years, we will see a major household name OEM fail or need a bailout due to
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.320]   not, you know, prices went up on them, but lack of access to a material, some kind of critical
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:20.640]   material like you're talking a GM, a Ford, somebody, probably not GM. I mean, if you think
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.160]   about it, do we need to even predict this? We went to a number of wars in the Middle East over
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.640]   oil. So if this is the new oil and that is the analogy, it's clearly going to cause, you know,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.480]   conflicts. And the question is, you know, are we going to build a strategic reserve of these
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.200]   materials? Do we have a strategic reserve? We talked about the food supply problem and
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.160]   Freeburg educated us on, hey, we've got like 30 days of food. This country has 90 days of food.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.400]   Do we need to have a strategic reserve of these rare earth minerals in the United States?
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.600]   Jason, I just don't think there'll be enough, because when you think about this,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.360]   we're talking about a multi trillions of dollars a year to electrify across.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.480]   So the demand is so great.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.160]   The demand is so great. We're talking about.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.040]   We can't build up supply.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.920]   We can't build up supply, or if we can't, we need to put the capital in. And right now,
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.720]   and that's why, you know, again, we'll let the investor panel, maybe they can bleed into this,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.600]   but that's why I think the whole space is a screaming buy. Because if you look across all
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   these companies, the cost of capital is just so high. And so one of two things has to happen,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.240]   or both, which is prices just have to go vertical, or someone starts taking them out,
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.400]   or we're just not going to have the stuff to electrify.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:36.000]   I understand that there's now been demonstrated significantly more lithium, tell me if I'm off
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.680]   on this, in the oceans than there is in the crust. And there may be systems for extracting lithium
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.840]   from the oceans that are electrochemical in nature that will allow us to kind of access
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.640]   that resource. And obviously, if you can get a system that can scale, you can get it all out
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   very quickly. So I mean, have you looked into these systems, in a sense, for the opportunity?
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.800]   Let me step back and then step down to that. So investment styles are cyclical,
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   just like industries. I believe in cycles, right? The cure for high prices is high prices.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.240]   There's no question in my mind, whether it's that, or there will be someone, or frankly,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.480]   maybe someone in this audience will have some breakthrough, right? And so we will solve this
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.560]   problem. But the challenge is, is that I don't even think that we've ignited the proper focus
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.400]   and resources to actually solve this problem. And so there may be, that may be an example of
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.640]   a solution, but that'll take five to 10 years. But in the meantime, there's, you know, there's
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:36.320]   a lot of resources that need to be applied to it. Adam Jonas, who is the auto analyst at Morgan
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.080]   Stanley, calls this the mother of all cat-back cycles, I think, right? And I think his estimate
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.680]   was like, you know, something like $3 trillion of capex needs to get spent over the next decade,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.600]   even to have a fighting chance on all of this stuff. And so if you're looking at new areas,
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.400]   so take your NDPR, NP materials hat off. But if you were in the same position you were
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.760]   back then now, not, not really, you don't need to go to the courthouse steps, but
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:11.840]   where would you be looking? You know, would you look at lithium? Would you look at nickel? Would
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.360]   you look at trying to do what, you know, China's doing and create better and simpler and cheaper
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.520]   chemistries for batteries? Like where would you spend your time right now if you weren't doing MP?
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.800]   So I think you actually said it perfectly well in the lead-in, which is just anything that is
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   real stuff. And so, yeah, all of it, lithium, copper, nickel, steel, aluminum, all of these
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   areas that have been starved, the cost of capital is just so high across the board, that if you can
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.360]   come up with solutions to deliver the shortages, and again, I'm not saying the next three months,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.920]   we could have a brutal recession for six months, but we see the long-term five, ten-year trend.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.560]   I think anywhere you look in this space, you're looking in the right direction. It's a wind at
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.880]   your back as opposed to, and again, I'm not, you know, taking a view, but to come up with a new
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.400]   cryptocurrency right now, it's a huge wind at your back relative to a headwind. Could you get your
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.720]   mind operational in today's political environment, do you think? Like if you had to start from
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:17.440]   scratch or if you found a new thing in Nevada or, you know, wherever it is. That's a great question,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.840]   and that's the challenge, is that it takes, to get any of these things, it takes a decade, right?
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.120]   It takes, if you have all the capital in place, all the human capital, all the, just the, you know,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.880]   going through that process to build it, the materials cost, and so could I do it? I think
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.440]   the world needs it, and I think that what we do environmentally is so unique that I think we could
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.640]   get it done, but this is a big challenge, and I think, frankly, it's a, you know, you guys were
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.760]   talking in the last session about we need to come together. This is a big-time area where we need to
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   come together. There should be a grand bargain, right? There should be, the environmentalists
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.120]   should say, "Okay, I accept that we need this stuff. I accept that we don't want it to be only
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.800]   made in Russia and China," and they should loosen up on some of the permitting stuff, and I think
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   the people who are just like, you know, "Drill, drill, drill, mine, mine, mine, don't care,"
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.360]   need to accept that we need to have really tough standards, and I think we should have some kind
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.600]   of grand bargain, and it could be, you know, tax policy focused on it, but there needs to be some
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.680]   kind of coming together in our country to recognize that we need this stuff. I mean,
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   let's be intellectually honest. People are hypocrites. The people in the EU, people in
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.000]   the United States, they want the energy. They want it cheap. They're complaining about the expense of,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.160]   you know, even a modest increase in energy costs, 10%, 20%, which they could withstand. They will
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.520]   complain about it, and they will not allow fracking in their country, but they're more than willing to
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.560]   let Russia frack for it. They don't want the cobalt coming out of the ground in California.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.440]   They're more than willing to let 15-year-olds dig it out of the ground without a mess. Eight-year-olds,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.440]   as horrific as it is, and there is intellectually dishonest, it's hypocrisy, and I think we have to
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.480]   own the fact that we want to live in large houses, and we want to blow the air conditioner on
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.280]   some ridiculous setting. America's homes are three times bigger than other homes.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:15.040]   So to build on this, two very quick stories. There's a massive deposit of lithium in Nevada,
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.600]   which would be enough to basically feed Tesla and another OEM, okay? So this would get probably
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:28.240]   somewhere between one and one and a half million cars, pure electric, on the road by 2030. And
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:35.840]   they were completely permitted by the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, and there was a lawsuit
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.720]   that was filed, and it's still wrangling its way through the federal court system, and what it is,
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:48.640]   is a claim that there is an upper wood grouse that could be endangered through this mining.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.240]   They have yet to find an actual upper wood grouse in the area, but nothing can happen.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.800]   Theoretically.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.960]   And so the problem is that we've now delayed two years. It could get resolved this year,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.840]   but it could be another two or three years, which means the lithium isn't actually available until
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.080]   2030.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.760]   Meanwhile, global warming continues to happen.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:11.520]   That's one story. Second story is that just yesterday, the city of Costa Mesa
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:19.840]   rejected a bid to build an electrolysis facility to create 100 million liters of clean water every
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.400]   single day.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.760]   Just a desal plant.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.840]   A desal plant, because they didn't want it.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.440]   Because they're going to lose some jellyfish or something.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.400]   No, they just didn't want it. They thought, "Ah, it's unsightly. I don't want this in
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:32.960]   Costa Mesa."
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.400]   And meanwhile, we're in a huge drought.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.480]   Pretty, it's a Costa, it's a Mesa. So, you know.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.800]   And so to your point, when the rubber meets the road, these unfortunate decisions get made,
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.240]   and there's no way to, you know, sort of calm top down.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.680]   But these people want to take 30-minute showers. I mean, that's the hypocrisy of it. If Americans
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.600]   really want to talk about conservation.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.080]   First of all, 30 minutes, there's nothing wrong with a 30-minute shower.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.520]   Listen, I wasn't calling you out specifically, but since you unclothed yourself, it's gratuitous,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.440]   in fact. It's completely gratuitous.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.200]   And it's such a great point. And my entire argument is that we're going to,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.800]   we will answer this question as a country, either now or later.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.080]   And the point about four of the 10 largest auto OEMs in the world are now Chinese companies.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.840]   And so this is now a competitive issue. And so we can keep kicking the can, or we'll face a crisis.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.000]   Are you beloved by the government? Are you beloved by, like, can you kind of like beeline
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.520]   and just cut through the nonsense because of Nevada government looks like you?
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   Well, I think that it's fair to say that the local officials are very happy with what we've done,
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.560]   with what we've achieved.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.840]   In South Carolina, right?
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.960]   The in Fort Worth, Texas, the magnetics facility.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.280]   You know, we have some partnerships with DOD.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.400]   The president announced those.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.360]   Where's the GM facility?
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.640]   The GM thing's in Texas.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.120]   In Texas.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.160]   In Texas. So I think that there is, frankly, support from both sides of the aisle for what
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.600]   we're doing. You know, there were executive orders on the rare earth magnetics industry,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.520]   specifically both in the Trump administration and in the Biden administration.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.960]   So I think what we're doing is hopefully nonpartisan. And frankly, I think all of this
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.840]   should be. And that's the point about the grand bargain. But even you raise a great point about
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.680]   just all of this stuff. It's, you know, there's so much pushback and we need to we need to figure
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.480]   out a way to get past that because this stuff has to has to get made.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.280]   I think it's incredible what you're doing. I mean, I'm a huge fan. Disclaimer,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.240]   I was also an investor.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   I am not an investor in the company, but we do appreciate you giving us the education.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.920]   And we do need to be independent from communist countries and really have the supply chain
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.600]   situation dialed in. So we appreciate the hard work for America and for freedom.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.040]   And I'm a huge fan of you guys. So thank you.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   [APPLAUSE]

[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.040]   Rain Man David Sacks.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.040]   I'm going all in.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.540]   And it said, we open sourced it to the fans,
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.040]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.040]   Love you, West.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   I'm the queen of quinoa.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   I'm going all in.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   What your winners line?
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   What, what your winners line?
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.040]   What, what your winners line?
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   Besties are gone.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   I hope they're not.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   That's my dog taking a piss in your driveway.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   Sacks.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   Oh, man.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.540]   My avatar will meet me at--
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.040]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy,
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.540]   because they're all just useless.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.540]   It's like this sexual tension that they just
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.540]   need to release somehow.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.540]   What your--
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.540]   B.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.540]   What your--
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.540]   B.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.540]   B.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.540]   We need to get merch.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   Besties are back.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.540]   I'm going all in.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:37.100]   I'm going all in.
