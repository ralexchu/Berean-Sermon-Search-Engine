[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:29.560]   - All right, good morning.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.760]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.520]   Let me jump right into the announcements this morning.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.680]   Next Sunday, we have our family retreat that we're going,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.240]   so most of the families with young children
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.680]   and young couples are headed out to the retreat site
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.520]   Friday and will be coming back on Sunday.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.100]   But we will have a full service here at church,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.240]   but the 11 o'clock one.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.400]   So you guys, if you're normally coming to 11,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.780]   nothing will change for you,
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.920]   but we do not have a nine o'clock service, only 11 o'clock.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.860]   And we do not have childcare at that time
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.420]   because all of our childcare helpers
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.600]   and Sunday school teachers and even youth group leaders,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.760]   they're all gonna be up at the retreat site.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.120]   So we are gonna have normal service at 11 here,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.240]   and we will not have an outside setup that Sunday either
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.900]   because our AV team is gonna be shorthanded,
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.120]   so we're not gonna have enough people
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.240]   to go out and set up everything.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.920]   So it's all gonna be inside.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.820]   We have a guest speaker that's coming,
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.560]   Pastor James Lee from Lighthouse Bible Church in San Diego.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.200]   He's gonna come and speak for us at 11 o'clock.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.240]   And so as far as service is concerned,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.440]   nothing's gonna be changing.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.240]   Everything's gonna be normal here at 11 o'clock,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.640]   but again, our family's gonna be out in the retreat site,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.520]   and then a week after,
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.420]   we'll go back to our normal schedule.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.880]   Second Peter Bible study, if you haven't signed up yet,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.440]   please, again, sign up.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.040]   We are right in the middle of putting the groups together,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.600]   and so please help us with that,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   especially if you are in the home group
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.680]   and you haven't signed up,
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.680]   please sign up as soon as you can.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.280]   Intentional Sisters Fellowship is starting again,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.360]   and so it's at Fridays at 9.30 to 11.30, or Monday evenings.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.640]   And so if you're interested in participating in that,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.840]   please contact Carrie Cheng.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.680]   Carrie Cheng.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.400]   So again, the sign up for all this
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.820]   will be on the Facebook page, so you can look for that.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.800]   And then Family Ministry Community Group
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   is starting in fall.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.380]   So more announcements will be given as we get closer to that,
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.360]   but just wanted to give you a heads up on it.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.640]   One last thing is I was asked from our finance team
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.320]   to ask that, even though on our slides it says PayPal,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.480]   but if you have access to Zelle,
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.080]   if you have access to Zelle, we're asking you to do that
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.120]   and to try to avoid PayPal.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.040]   If PayPal is the only avenue
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   that you are able to pay electronically,
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   you can still pay that,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.960]   but we've been having some issues with PayPal.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   They're starting to charge every transaction,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.600]   and it's quite a bit.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.280]   And so if you do have access to Zelle,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.840]   so some of you guys who don't know what Zelle is,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   let me bring you up to 22nd century, okay, 21st century.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.800]   If you have a bank account,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.160]   Zelle is connected to almost all of your bank accounts,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.600]   even the credit unions.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.800]   And so if you go on your website and you see,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.000]   like, you wanna be able to transfer money,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.680]   you'll be able to connect Zelle,
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.640]   and once you open up that account,
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.540]   you'll be able to pay on that.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.880]   So if you do have access to that,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.400]   please use that as your first priority,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.960]   and then if you do not, then you can go to PayPal.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.800]   But we're trying to,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.240]   finance team asked me to pass on that information,
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.320]   so if you can transfer that, that would be appreciated.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.280]   Okay?
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.520]   All right, so if you are, again,
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.200]   visiting us for the first time,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.040]   we welcome you.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.520]   Our welcome table is outside.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.400]   As you're exiting, you'll see a table out there,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.760]   and then if you go visit them
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.040]   and whatever questions that you may have,
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.440]   they'll be able to answer your questions
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.300]   and then direct you to the right department,
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.640]   whatever department that you're looking for.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.800]   And then if you have a physical check
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.080]   or physical offering to give,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   we have a offering box in the back here.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.820]   So as you're exiting, you'll see under that big clock,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.760]   there's an offering box,
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.160]   so you can drop it off there after the service is over.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.000]   Okay?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.820]   So let me pray for us,
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.440]   and then I'll give you a minute to give your offering,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.100]   and then we'll begin our worship.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.540]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Lord God,
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.040]   for your constant grace,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.440]   the things that we are aware of,
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.480]   the things that we are not aware of.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.440]   Help us, Lord, to give our heart fully to you.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.600]   May it be a pleasing aroma to you, Lord God,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.500]   as we have come to worship you.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.680]   Help us, Lord, to give you our best in our heart.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.760]   Whatever distractions that we may have brought
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.920]   into this room, help us, Lord God,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.200]   to fix it upon Christ and Christ alone.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.680]   May this offering that we give be multiplied
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.840]   36 hundredfold for the purpose of your kingdom.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.760]   (gentle piano music)

[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.020]   (bell tolling)
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:19.720]   - All right, we are taking a short break
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.040]   because we have communion today
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.200]   and we wanna make sure that we're all on the same page
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.740]   as we participate in this communion.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.740]   And so, we wanna take some time to look at the passage
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.360]   in 1 Corinthians 11.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.960]   The whole text that we're gonna be covering
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.440]   is from 17 all the way to 34,
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.840]   but I'm just going to be highlighting the text
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.080]   in verse 23 to 26, okay?
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.160]   1 Corinthians 11, verse 23 to 26.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.840]   For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.800]   to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.180]   in which He was betrayed took bread.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.880]   When He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.360]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.840]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.240]   In the same way, He took the cup also after supper,
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.620]   saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.700]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.940]   "For as often as you eat the bread and drink the cup,
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.520]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes."
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.360]   Let's pray.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:26.040]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would bless this time.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.100]   May your word have power to change our hearts,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.600]   our mind, and our very lives.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.720]   I pray, Father God, that what you have intended
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.920]   in this text, that it would have its full effect in us.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.560]   So we ask for your blessing and your grace.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.860]   You know, in our generation,
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.840]   we have a cliche that we've been saying.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.040]   And the cliches are there for a reason,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.480]   because at the core of it, there's some truth.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.760]   But cliches are also very dangerous
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.720]   if you don't understand the context in which it is said,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.240]   and then you kind of universally apply in all things.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.200]   I think one of the most commonly heard cliches
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.840]   in our generation is Christianity is a relationship
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.560]   and not a religion, right?
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.800]   You probably heard that before.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.200]   You may have said that.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.580]   At the core of it, it's true.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.360]   And the problem that that cliche addresses
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.160]   is because we are living in a post-Christian culture,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.000]   that there's a lot of things that we do,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.240]   we just automatically believe
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.280]   that we've been raised in a church,
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   and if my parents are Christians
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.160]   or my great-grandparents are Christians,
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.320]   that it would just kind of pass down to us.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.000]   In fact, they did a survey a while back
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.760]   to see what percentage of Americans
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.080]   consider themselves Christians.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.640]   And so, again, this is a little bit outdated,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   and I think the number is a bit less than that now,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.200]   but back in the '90s, the number was almost 86%
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.100]   of people surveyed said that they were Christian.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.560]   Obviously, we know that that's not true, right?
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.160]   We know that, based upon what we know in Scripture,
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.040]   that that number is exaggerated.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.080]   That means there's that many people
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.680]   who believe that they're Christian
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.520]   because they were either raised in a church
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.800]   or have some sort of Christianity in their home,
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.080]   and as a result of that,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.200]   that they themselves believe that they are saved.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.520]   Now, it is that type of culture
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   that this cliche is addressing,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.640]   that Christianity is not a religion but a relationship,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.020]   that there needs to be a personal relationship with Christ,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.840]   which is true.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.160]   You can't just come to church and through osmosis
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.520]   and just by being in a Christian home make you a Christian.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.420]   There has to be a personal relationship with Christ.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.660]   But along with all cliches,
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.180]   there's also the flip side of that,
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.380]   that if we're not careful,
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.360]   and if we apply it to the fullest,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.440]   it's not necessarily true
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.780]   because Christianity is a religion.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.460]   'Cause the definition of religion
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.900]   is a set of doctrine or rules
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.260]   that distinguishes that particular religion
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.000]   with any other religion.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.860]   So Christian religion is distinct from Muslims
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.840]   or from Buddhism.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.160]   There's a different set of doctrines that they believe
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.980]   that causes them to say that we are set apart
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.460]   and we're different in this way.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.360]   So Christianity is also a religion
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.260]   where we adhere to certain doctrines,
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.860]   and if you do not adhere to these doctrines,
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.020]   you are not Christian.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.180]   And so, especially in our generation,
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.100]   because of this cliche has been applied,
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.780]   there's a lot of people who say,
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.300]   "Well, it doesn't matter if you go to church
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.460]   "because it's just personal between me and God."
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.980]   Especially in this YouTube generation after the pandemic,
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.040]   we have so many people who say,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   "Well, physical church is not important
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.260]   "because it's about my personal relationship with God."
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.020]   It is about your personal relationship with God,
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.840]   but there are specific, very focused teaching
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.060]   that distinguishes us and tells us
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.140]   that this is what a Christian ought to believe
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.940]   and ought to do.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.100]   Now, along with that,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.780]   the reason why I introduced my sermon this morning
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.800]   is because of the religious things that we talk about,
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.380]   there's two things that, if we're not careful,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.700]   that we can just simply dismiss.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.540]   We just do it.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.120]   You just grew up doing it.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.780]   The two ordinances that we're talking about.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.660]   So when we talk about religiousness,
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.900]   we say, "Well, I mean, that sounds very legalistic,
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.460]   "saying like we need to be baptized,"
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.580]   or, "We don't get saved because of baptism."
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.100]   So it doesn't really matter one way or the other.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.660]   And same thing with communion, right?
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.780]   It doesn't save us, it doesn't give us any specific power,
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.460]   so it must not be too important.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.320]   It's just another religious activity.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.900]   Well, as I said, religious activity is important
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.340]   because these are two ordinances
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.940]   that has been set apart as sacred.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.180]   When baptism is done correctly,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.380]   it is a public proclamation of our faith.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.940]   It reminds us of our own testimony.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.040]   It is the entrance into the local church,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.860]   the universal church.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.940]   So when done properly, it reminds us of who we are,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.060]   our identity, the power of the gospel.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.900]   And so baptism is an integral part.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.100]   It's the first act of obedience in the church.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.620]   And that's why even Christ,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.580]   when he was being baptized by John the Baptist,
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.100]   he says, "I'm doing this to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.300]   Jesus himself submitted himself to baptism
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.140]   because that's what was established.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.380]   Communion is another one of those
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.700]   where we just practice it,
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.020]   and maybe you grew up in the church practicing this,
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.140]   and it just happens,
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.820]   and maybe not understanding the significance of it.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.780]   So whether we participate in it, how we participate in it,
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.720]   it doesn't really matter
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.220]   because it's just one of those duties.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   You just come on Sunday,
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.580]   and it just happened to be communion,
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.520]   so you're just gonna participate in it.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.580]   When baptism is done poorly,
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.700]   you grow up thinking you got baptized,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.820]   so at some point in my life, I got baptized, so I'm saved.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.340]   I'm covered by the blessing of God.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.780]   We have people coming into our church all the time.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.460]   And I got baptized when I was two or three or five,
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.020]   or even when I wasn't a Christian,
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.740]   I was at some camp, and we just jumped into the water.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.500]   And everybody who came out, we were all baptized,
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.460]   and so therefore, I'm good.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.620]   So we have a generation filled with people
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.500]   because of the way that baptism was done
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.620]   have a misunderstanding
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.580]   that that somehow covers them from their sins.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.060]   And same thing with communion.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.880]   If communion is done poorly,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.020]   you have a generation of people
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.460]   who just because they're taking communion
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.460]   that somehow it has some magical protection power,
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.300]   and that kind of connects us to God,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.060]   and so we're safe, at least for this period,
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.920]   until the next communion comes around.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.260]   Obviously, communion in and of itself
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.300]   has no power to do that.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.100]   What I wanna look with you this morning through this text,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.180]   four things that it points out
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.100]   that the communion was given us for.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.340]   If communion is done correctly,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.500]   it reminds and refreshes our worship to our Savior.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.340]   That's number one.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.180]   Two, if communion is done correctly,
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.660]   it causes us to examine ourselves
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.220]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.980]   It's for our sanctification.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.020]   Third, if done correctly,
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.400]   it restores and unites the fellowship of the body of Christ.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.780]   It sanctifies and unites the church.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.260]   Four, when communion is done correctly,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.620]   it proclaims the gospel until he comes.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.380]   So I wanna go through these four points
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.420]   that are listed in this text,
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.300]   and as we go through it,
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.480]   hopefully when we participate in the communion,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.060]   that we would have a renewed sense of commitment,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.320]   renewed sense of reverence
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.740]   toward what it is that we're doing this morning.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.220]   One, when done correctly,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.500]   it reminds us and refreshes us of our worship to our Savior.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.680]   First Corinthians 11, 24 through 25.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.460]   When he had given thanks,
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.700]   he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.280]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.520]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.420]   saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.820]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me."
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.220]   So first and foremost, we participate in communion.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.820]   Communion has been set apart
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.420]   in order that we can remember
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.620]   and focus our attention upon Christ,
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.340]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.460]   The reason why this is so important
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.200]   is because you and I have a natural tendency to forget.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.120]   How many of you, you don't need to raise your hand,
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.720]   but how many of you were adults when 9/11 happened?
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.100]   A handful of you, right?
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.300]   If you remember when 9/11 happened,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.820]   I mean, it was a shock for all of us
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.580]   to see the Twin Towers fall that morning
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.060]   and we've read about war, we've seen movies about wars,
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.820]   but all of a sudden, war became real,
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.020]   that United States is being attacked.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.060]   Thousands of people just perished just instantaneously.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.840]   And I remember after that,
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.560]   I saw something that I've never seen in my lifetime
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.540]   and I'm not sure if I'm gonna ever see it again.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.820]   I saw the Democrats and the Republicans
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.820]   linked arm to arm, came out in public at Capitol Hill
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.180]   and basically saying that we will never forget.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.580]   You attack us, we're united, we're resolved.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.760]   And as a result of that, it changed the way we flew.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.680]   You couldn't wear shoes anymore to go to the airport.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.100]   All of a sudden, all kinds of liquid had to be banned.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.460]   But at that time, people were more than willing,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.740]   more than willing because they said we will never forget.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.620]   That was the mantra of that period, we will never forget.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.300]   And the reason why they kept on saying that
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.560]   is because they were reminded,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.980]   we were reminded that we have people around the world
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.460]   who hate this country and what it stands for
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.940]   and that they will do everything in their power
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.940]   to attack us.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.620]   So we're gonna be ready, we're gonna be resolved,
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.660]   we're gonna be united, we're gonna do whatever it takes.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.180]   And so Republicans, Democrats came together,
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.660]   arms linked, saying we will never forget.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.020]   Well, guess what?
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:05.920]   We forgot.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   Decades have gone by and now the TSA has become a joke,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.840]   an inconvenience, and so right or wrong,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.000]   all the stuff that was implemented at that time
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.720]   being so resolved that we're gonna be ready to fight
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.060]   and go to battle, for the most part, we've forgotten.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:31.080]   Whatever your politics may be, at that time,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.920]   the reason why it was so important that we never forget
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.840]   is because of the consequences that if we do forget.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.940]   When Jesus says, do this in remembrance of me,
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.560]   God knew our tendency to drift.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.560]   And so this that Jesus is referring to
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.760]   was the Passover meal that they were participating,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.800]   that God commanded the nation of Israel.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.480]   As soon as they left Egypt,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.240]   God commanded the Passover meal to be celebrated every year.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.880]   And this is what he says in Exodus 13, three.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.080]   Then Moses said to the people,
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.360]   remember this day in which you came out from Egypt,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.600]   out of the house of slavery,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.640]   for by strong hand of the Lord
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.040]   brought you out from this place.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.060]   He said, do this.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.340]   And he implemented this as soon as they left Egypt,
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.840]   not a year, not 10 years later,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.500]   but as soon as they left, because God knew
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.120]   the moment that you forgot why or how you became a nation,
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.280]   you're going to start to imitate all the other nations.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.560]   That the whole reason why Israel even exists
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.820]   is because of God's power and his mercy and his covenant.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.720]   Again, he says in Deuteronomy 7, 18,
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.760]   to remember that in the midst,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.280]   when you go out there and then you run into troubles
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.120]   and powers that are greater than you physically,
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.760]   remember who God is, remember how he delivered you,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.320]   Deuteronomy 7, 18.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.160]   If you say in your heart, these nations are greater than I,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.280]   how can I dispossess them?
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.640]   You shall not be afraid of them,
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.320]   but you shall remember that the Lord your God
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.720]   did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt,
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.820]   the great trials that your eyes saw,
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.440]   the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand,
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.800]   and the outstretched arm,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.440]   by which the Lord your God brought you out.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.760]   So will the Lord your God do to all the peoples
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.400]   of whom you are afraid.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.620]   In the time of distress, in the time of trouble,
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.660]   and you begin to think that the powers that surround you,
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.600]   that are suppressing you,
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.940]   is greater than you can handle, he says, remember.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.780]   He who began a good work in you,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.620]   he will carry it unto completion to the day of Christ.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.780]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.580]   he loved you so much that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.820]   and that same power that resurrected Christ dwells in you,
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.520]   that Holy Spirit dwells in you.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.220]   How much of our depression, how much of our anxiety,
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.980]   comes because we forget, we forget.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.700]   We're children of God.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.700]   He loved us so much that he says he counts our very hairs,
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.400]   and yet when our finances don't meet,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.980]   or we fall ill, or something doesn't seem quite right
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.320]   going forward, and maybe we didn't save enough
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.380]   for retirement, or whatever causes anxiousness,
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.800]   how much of that is because we have forgotten
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.460]   what it is that we already have in Christ?
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.100]   Why was this so essential for the nation of Israel?
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.980]   Because the success of the nation of Israel
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.980]   was directly linked to their faith in God.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.860]   And the moment they begin to drift
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.980]   from focusing their eyes on Christ,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.300]   not just their finance, not just the nation,
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.300]   everything begins to crumble.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.160]   And same thing with all of us.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:49.180]   If our whole life is connected to Christ,
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.560]   the moment we begin to forget what it is that we have,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.000]   it's just some theological thing that we check off,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.960]   but it's not real.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.420]   We sing about it, we memorize, we study the scripture,
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.820]   but when we examine our life carefully,
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.800]   how much of our life actually reflect the faith
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.600]   that we profess on Sunday morning?
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.140]   How much of our anxiety and depression,
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.020]   or whatever it is that we struggle with,
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.740]   is directly linked to forgetting
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.440]   what it is that we have in Christ?
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:22.660]   See, fourth and finally, why we need to remember,
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.980]   he says in Deuteronomy 8, 18, and I believe,
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.720]   for us, who live in Orange County,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.320]   this is probably our greatest struggle.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.300]   He says, "Take care lest you forget the Lord your God
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.860]   "by not keeping the commandments and his rules and statutes
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.540]   "which I commanded you today,
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.540]   "lest when you have eaten and are full
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.060]   "and have built good houses and live in them,"
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.720]   listen carefully, "when everything is going well,
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.340]   "you have a nice house and you have a nice car
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.100]   "and your bills are paid,
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.980]   "when your herds and flocks multiply
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.620]   "and your silver and gold is multiplied
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.860]   "and all that you have is multiplied,
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.420]   "then your heart will be lifted up
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.980]   "and you forget the Lord your God
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.940]   "who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.060]   "out of the house of slavery."
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.260]   Let me stop right there.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:14.260]   I know how we are when we're in college,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.260]   right, and I know many of you students are in college,
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.900]   but in college, you don't have a lot, right?
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.500]   You say, "Your parents have a lot, not you."
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.860]   So when we're younger, you know,
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.680]   where it's like everything's wide open
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.140]   and you say, "Oh, I believe in God,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.100]   "he's my treasure, he's all these,"
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.180]   then you get married, have kids,
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.680]   your salary begins to increase,
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.420]   you finish your, you know, start getting into your career
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.860]   and you start becoming a boss
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.020]   and then you have more money than you actually need
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   and then after a while, you look at your faith,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.340]   it's nothing like it was when you were younger
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:58.780]   and you begin to convince yourself that this is normal.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.100]   This is just what happens.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.540]   Nobody maintains their first love
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.580]   and you just kind of accepted that as normal.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.860]   You remember what it was like
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.060]   when you wanted to go out to missions
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.740]   and the possibility of doing work for the Lord
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.020]   and all these things but now it's just, you know,
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.580]   it's like, yeah, it's good for some people
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.540]   but you're busy raising your children,
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.300]   paying off your mortgage, you know,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.860]   saving enough money for retirement.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.700]   Next thing you know, your heart is hardened toward God
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.120]   and so you're going through the motion
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.660]   and you have a form of godliness but there's no power.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.380]   Everything's, all your bills are paid off,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.240]   everything's going well and so the temptation is,
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.380]   there is no desperation for God anymore.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.100]   You want God but you don't need him.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.500]   He says the communion table was given to the church
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.980]   for the purpose of reminding us
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.840]   that everything we have is because of him.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.060]   As soon as we begin to say we're proud and I did this,
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.800]   we begin to forget God, we start to just be religious.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.100]   We sing songs but there's no passion behind that.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.480]   You just, you know, you have to have a new song
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.700]   every few months because, you know,
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.520]   now all these new songs become old so quick.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.060]   And so you need to constantly have new songs
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.660]   because the songs in and of itself,
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.260]   it's not the words that are causing you
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.260]   to sing praises to God, it's just the newness of things.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:33.340]   Even the sermons, great, but after you hear it for a while,
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.840]   it's like it's another sermon.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:39.220]   It says in verse 17, beware lest you say in your heart,
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.540]   my power and the might of my hand
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.340]   have gotten me this wealth.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.860]   You shall remember the Lord your God
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.980]   for it is he who gives you power to get wealth.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.560]   That he may confirm his covenant
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.220]   that he swore to your fathers, and it is this day.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.060]   And if you forget the Lord your God
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.380]   and you go after the gods and serve them and worship them,
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.440]   now we may look at that and say,
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.500]   well, we don't worship idols, sure we do.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.660]   Anything that has possessed your heart,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:08.280]   any pursuit that is greater than your pursuit of Christ
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.780]   is your idol.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.340]   Israelites never shook their hands at Yahweh
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   and say, I don't trust you, I'm gonna trust Baal instead.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.380]   No, they added Baal to the worship.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.100]   They added Asherah to worship of Yahweh.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.220]   They never rejected God, they just added that
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.980]   and they just ran to it whenever it was more convenient.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.100]   So whatever it is that we run to,
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.340]   instead of God, is our idol.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.300]   He says, when you run to your gods
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.800]   and serve them and worship them,
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.840]   I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.620]   He says, once you become proud,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.900]   once you become independent,
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.300]   once you begin to forget God,
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.380]   you are that close of perishing.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.540]   And in order to prevent them from this danger,
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.540]   he inaugurated the Passover meal
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.980]   so that every year that they would be reminded,
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.220]   the whole reason why you exist as a nation
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.260]   is because God's power and his mercy
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.620]   and the covenant that he made with you.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.740]   And it is that meal, he says, do this.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.100]   What God has implemented with the nation of Israel,
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.960]   now do this in remembrance.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.100]   All of the Passover was to point to
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.300]   what he was gonna do at the cross
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.900]   and that our health,
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:27.120]   our ability to live, to function,
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.980]   all of it is connected to how connected we are
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.220]   to this cross.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.540]   Remember, in fact, whole nation of Israel's downfall
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.620]   is summarized in this text, Hosea 13, six.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.460]   When I fed them, they were satisfied.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.120]   Let's dissect this.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.380]   What do they mean by satisfied?
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.100]   They were thankful, they were blessed,
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.220]   they worshiped God, they praised God.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.660]   When God fed them, when you got a job,
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.980]   when you were sick and you became healthy,
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.920]   when you have relational problems and it gets solved,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.900]   when you wanted something, you desire it.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.180]   Whatever it is that you desire,
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.400]   that God gave it to you and answered your prayer
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.020]   and he was gracious and he said,
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.800]   they were satisfied, thankful, worshiping.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.140]   He said, when they were satisfied, they became proud.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.620]   That urgency, once it goes away,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.060]   it's like, oh, I could do it.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.680]   Tomorrow morning, whether you prayed this week or not,
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.620]   whether you clung to God or not,
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.080]   if you don't see any difference from Monday,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.560]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.320]   that's a good sign you've forgotten him.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.560]   Whether you crack your Bible Monday or not,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.740]   whether you're praying to him and seeking him,
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.880]   whether you feel this urgency to share the gospel or not,
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.100]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.480]   doesn't look any different other than the external pressure
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.280]   to meet whatever schedule that has been placed on your table.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.240]   Outside of that, it doesn't look any different.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.580]   Whether you prayed for, didn't pray for a day,
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.920]   whether you didn't pray for a year,
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.780]   your life doesn't look any different.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:12.080]   You've forgotten God.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:16.680]   You want him, but you don't need him.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:22.760]   And as a result of that, whether you admit it or not,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.160]   your heart is proud.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.000]   You may have the reputation of being humble,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.320]   and maybe compared to other proud people, you may be humble,
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.980]   but in God's sight, you have become proud.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.100]   Because he said your very life depends upon
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.000]   you being connected to Christ.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.160]   But you're not connected to Christ,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.580]   other than out of religious duty.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.240]   See, the communion table was given to us as a result
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.800]   because God knew our tendency to drift
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.280]   and get entangled.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.080]   And again, most of the time, not with sinful things,
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:06.080]   just raising kids, paying bills, doing a good job at work,
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.340]   having friends, having a good marriage,
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.080]   serving the church sometimes.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.880]   And in the midst of all of that, if you're honest,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.240]   your heart has drifted far from God.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.500]   You can't think of the last time you came in
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.640]   with expectations and wanting to praise God.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.740]   You can't remember the last time that God drove you
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.720]   to your knees with deep sighing,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.240]   this groaning that the Holy Spirit has, desperate for him,
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.700]   like wanting to connect with him, wanting to commune with him.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.740]   You can't remember the last time that has happened.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.900]   And so you're just kind of like, well, I'm just gonna do
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.100]   what I'm supposed to do, and you've been doing that
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.760]   for weeks, for months, maybe for years.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.640]   Next thing you know, for decades.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.400]   So you are what the Bible says.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.920]   You have a form of godliness, but there's no power.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.740]   There's no power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.440]   Everything you say is calculated.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.840]   It's scripted.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.880]   You say what you're supposed to say.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.480]   You say what you say in reaction,
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.680]   but it is not an overflow of your heart.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.000]   You sing because it's time to sing,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.380]   but it's not an overflow of worship.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.040]   You evangelize because it's time to evangelize,
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.880]   but it's not an overflow of your heart
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.080]   wanting to see the lost come to Christ.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.440]   Maybe it's because we have forgotten.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.520]   Oskin is in his book, No God But God,
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.420]   basically chronicles three generations
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.800]   of what leads to apostasy.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.700]   First generation are the people who believe Christ,
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.160]   and they're the ones who go out to missions and sacrifice,
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.900]   and they're faithful to church,
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.760]   and building up the body of Christ.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.780]   And he said eventually as they begin to drift,
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.900]   they raise nominal Christian kids
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.660]   because they raise a generation of children
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.480]   who don't have any skin in the game.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.160]   They've sacrificed nothing.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.820]   They've given nothing.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.540]   So they know Christianity from a distance,
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.980]   from set of doctrines, from things that you profess,
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.900]   from Sunday school, from VBS,
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.140]   but it is not an active faith.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.280]   It is not a sacrificial faith.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   They've just inherited what the first generation has,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.540]   and they just adopted it for themselves,
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.860]   and so now you are raising a generation
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.540]   of lukewarm Christians who are just going through the motion
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.440]   but they don't really know the power.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.500]   And so their worship is always flippant.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.240]   They go to church but give the minimum amount
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.220]   of time and effort.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.860]   And then he says the third generation
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.280]   is where apostasy happens.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.220]   Children who are raised in a lukewarm home
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.840]   have no purpose for this religion.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.860]   It does nothing other than take away
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.720]   what they wanna do on Sunday morning.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.680]   Giving is just throwing away money.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.620]   What is this for?
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.640]   Sacrifice, evangelism, it's just weird.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.140]   And so all they see religion as sacrifice
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.380]   and no benefit that comes from that
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.200]   other than some sort of a security blanket
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.500]   that when I die, then maybe I'll go to heaven.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.060]   And it leads to apostasy.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.580]   And he says from his study,
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.020]   he's not saying that every generation,
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.940]   every family falls into that,
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.140]   but even just the years that I've been a pastor
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.740]   and a Christian, I've seen that.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.900]   In Revelations chapter two, four to five,
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.220]   you know that passage when he is warning
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.260]   the church of Ephesus.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.900]   He said I have this against you
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:42.100]   that you have left your first love, left.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.700]   In NIV, it says you have forsaken.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.580]   Forsaken is more of the translation.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.100]   It wasn't just something that happened.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.060]   It wasn't an accident.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.580]   You didn't just lose it.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.900]   He says you deliberately have forsaken it.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.980]   You know what's interesting?
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.100]   Book of Revelation was written in 96 AD,
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.380]   which means it was about 60 years removed
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.660]   from the resurrection of Christ.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   So it's about three generations
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.680]   where you have children, parents, and grandparents,
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.900]   maybe still alive.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.820]   Maybe the first generation have already passed away.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.860]   Second generation are the ones who are leading the church,
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.700]   and then the congregants are the third generation.
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:25.380]   He says to them, you're doing all the right things.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.100]   You test the apostles to see if they're true,
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.740]   and you do not tolerate false doctrine.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.140]   So you know on paper what to do,
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.860]   but he says you have forsaken your first love.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.680]   Your hearts are far from me.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.540]   And then he says, therefore,
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:44.460]   remember from which you have fallen.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.780]   He doesn't say to innovate.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.460]   He doesn't say to find new ways to worship God.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.380]   He says remember the height from which you have fallen.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.780]   Remember when you were younger.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.140]   Remember when you first met Christ,
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.420]   when he meant everything to you?
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.460]   Every time you heard someone else's testimony,
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.100]   how it stirred you because it reminded you
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.940]   of your own testimony?
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.340]   Remember when you first became a Christian,
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.980]   you were so eager to share the gospel to other people
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.140]   because you can't possibly imagine
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.460]   even strangers coming into the judgment of God?
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.820]   Remember how you dedicated your summers to go overseas
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.780]   to places that are uncomfortable?
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.740]   That you were open if God called you to full-time missions,
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.900]   how you were willing to do all of that?
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.660]   But you can't remember now
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:32.920]   the last time you wept for the lost.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:37.460]   You can't remember the last time you pleaded on your knees
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:42.400]   for even your family members who may not be Christians,
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.620]   that our hearts have drifted so far away
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.580]   that we don't remember.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.880]   So we just revert back to religiousness.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.500]   We just do what we're told to do.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.440]   And yet we know that our hearts have drifted so far.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:03.540]   See, the communion table was given to us for that purpose
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.860]   because he knew our tendency to drift.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.580]   He knew our tendency to forget.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.020]   He knew our tendency to be wrapped up in our lives
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.100]   and just do what we're supposed to do
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:18.880]   with no real power.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.060]   If done correctly, it's supposed to revive us,
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.300]   renew us, and refresh us,
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.640]   that we would continue what we had from the beginning.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.300]   Number two, if done correctly,
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.500]   it causes us to examine ourselves carefully.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.420]   It leads us to repentance.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.340]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 27, 32, it says,
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.700]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.520]   "and drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.740]   "shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.540]   In an unworthy manner.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:54.980]   When this is just religiousness,
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.060]   whether you do it or don't do it,
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.620]   I mean, yeah, great, I mean, you showed up today
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:03.420]   and we're gonna have grape juice
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.500]   and this little chip that we have in here.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.300]   So if you have it, oh, you did it.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.180]   If you didn't do it, it means nothing.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.560]   You're not gonna see any difference
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.960]   today, tomorrow, or any day.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:19.400]   It says here, if you participate in a day
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.980]   because they participate in an unworthy manner,
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.500]   he said, verse 28, "But a man must examine himself
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.680]   "and in so doing, he is to eat the bread
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.820]   "and drink of the cup.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.140]   "For he who eats and drinks and eats and drinks
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.540]   "judgment to himself if he does not judge
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.500]   "the body correctly."
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.300]   In other words, if you don't understand
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.780]   the sacredness of what this is,
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.020]   that this is not just grape juice,
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.460]   this is not just some piece of bread,
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.620]   but this symbolizes his blood.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.800]   This symbolizes his flesh.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.780]   And if you participate in an unworthy manner,
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.900]   he says, you are deliberately, willfully
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.300]   bringing upon judgment upon yourself.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.180]   In fact, the early church, people were actually
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.900]   falling sick, and then some say, he says,
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.380]   they were falling asleep, which means
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.420]   they were dying.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:10.340]   Imagine how seriously we would take communion
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.920]   if that was happening today.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.800]   If we took it today, and then some of you
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.200]   are just vomiting, running to the bathroom.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:26.540]   Even if one person died, out of 700, 800 people,
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.660]   even if one person died, my guess is,
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.060]   next time we have communion,
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.880]   there's gonna be some seriousness.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.380]   You're gonna probably be at church early,
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:43.760]   praying, repenting, examining,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.340]   that you make sure that you're not participating
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.500]   in an unworthy manner.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.540]   But here's the issue.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.640]   We don't see it happening.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.140]   I don't remember the last time I saw somebody
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.540]   who got sick, and it's like, oh, it's communion.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:04.540]   I didn't take it seriously.
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.820]   Like somebody passed away, it's like,
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.500]   oh, it was an unworthy manner.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.820]   They didn't judge the body correctly, so they died.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:14.100]   Now, we haven't seen that, right?
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.100]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.800]   Are you sure that's not happening?
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:24.100]   It's just a question.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.540]   It's just a question, right?
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.580]   Don't call me a heretic.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.640]   It's just a question.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:35.940]   What if God is actually disciplining the church,
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.940]   but you just haven't connected the dots?
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:43.940]   What if a sickness that was coming,
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.900]   maybe it didn't happen that hour?
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.640]   Maybe it happened way later.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.020]   What if it wasn't sickness?
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.920]   What if there was trouble in your life?
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.560]   Turmoil in your marriage?
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.320]   Struggle with your children?
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.120]   What if that was a result of an unworthy participation
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.560]   of the Lord's table?
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.600]   We just haven't connected the dots.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.520]   Now, I'm not saying that that is,
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.080]   'cause I can't prove to you that that is,
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.400]   'cause I don't have any revelation that that is,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.600]   but what I do know is that's what it says
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.200]   that happens in the church, in the early church.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.920]   And maybe they didn't even know.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.680]   Maybe that's why Paul is saying,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:34.080]   some of you are falling asleep and you don't know,
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.120]   but that's as a result of your unworthy manner.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.480]   Maybe some of them didn't know that that was the connection,
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.200]   and that's why Paul is pointing that out and telling them,
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.040]   you don't realize the sickness and the trouble
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.760]   that you're having is because you're participating
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.600]   in an unworthy manner.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.700]   Imagine the revival that would break out in the church.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.840]   Unconfessed sins that we will bring to the forefront.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:59.680]   People who are lukewarm, who just kind of let it be,
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:04.640]   'cause we're busy, how much that would affect the church
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.580]   if we actually approached the communion table
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.260]   the way it is established in the early church.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:14.800]   That's what it was meant to do, right?
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.160]   If you don't believe it, all this is nonsense.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.200]   Just nonsense, right?
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.840]   I come to church and this guy's making a big deal
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.720]   about communion, right?
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.960]   This guy's making a big deal because as long as I go
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.560]   to church, it's a personal relationship, right?
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.440]   If as long as I have a relationship with God,
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.040]   all this doesn't matter, right?
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.600]   Of course it matters, it's in the Bible.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.800]   What I read to you is straight out of the Bible, right?
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:45.440]   The communion table was meant for us to take time,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.560]   to examine ourselves carefully.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.840]   Am I walking right with God?
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.400]   Is my confession true?
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.640]   Have I swept sin underneath the rug
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.480]   and just forgotten about it?
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.080]   You just kind of like, 'cause I don't see any consequence,
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.000]   and even though there's all kinds of turmoil in your life,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.700]   you just don't connect it to the fact
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.680]   that maybe it could be as a result
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.580]   of a discipline from our Father.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.800]   'Cause Bible clearly says that those whom he loves,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.080]   he disciplines, but you don't recognize,
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.400]   even when you get disciplined,
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.040]   that this is discipline from God.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.320]   So you seek counsel, you seek direction,
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.240]   you seek like right things, right decisions,
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.720]   and you seek people, but did you ever consider
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.540]   maybe it's a discipline from God to bring us,
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.240]   to make us desperate, to remind us,
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.920]   to get on our knees, to pray, and to cry out to God,
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.560]   to take our sins seriously?
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.240]   Could be.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.700]   At the minimum, we should consider it
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.040]   because it's in the Bible.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.240]   Thirdly, done correctly, it restores
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.800]   and unites the fellowship of the body.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.960]   First Corinthians 11, 18 to 22.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.720]   For in the first place, when you come together as a church,
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.520]   I hear the divisions exist among you,
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.320]   and in part, I believe it.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.060]   For there must also be factions among you,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.520]   so that those who are approved
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.800]   may become an evident among you.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.200]   Therefore, when you meet together,
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.280]   it is not to eat the Lord's supper,
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.640]   for in your eating, each one takes his own supper,
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.520]   and one is hungry and the other is drunk.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.680]   And basically, he says that if you come
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.200]   and you don't consider the other people in your church,
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.480]   he says you're not judging the body correctly.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.060]   That's not Lord's supper.
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.800]   There's a reason why we don't take the Lord's supper,
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.520]   we don't take the communion in our homes,
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.880]   because it was meant to be done
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.360]   in the context of the body of Christ.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.560]   This is not something personal and romantic
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.980]   that you do between two people.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.840]   This is meant to be done in the context
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   of the body of Christ,
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.400]   because part of the meaning behind it is
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.160]   that you and I are all one.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.240]   We're one.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.760]   So when you say, I like these people,
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.800]   but I don't like those people.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.320]   I wanna spend time with them,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.400]   but those people I don't like.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.800]   These people, I don't like the way they talk.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.360]   Those people, I have nothing in common.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.780]   I wanna stick with my friends.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.600]   When you do that, you may not be saying that,
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.040]   but what you're doing is,
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.700]   I wanna stick around with other mouths.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.660]   I'll tolerate the hair because it's close.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.100]   Feet, no, no thank you.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.640]   I don't like feet.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.740]   Like fingers, I don't like fingers.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:31.860]   Something near the mouth, I can tolerate that.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.500]   So you come to church, especially as the church gets bigger,
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.740]   you have a sphere of friends that you can tolerate.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.300]   Anybody you don't tolerate, they're like acquaintances,
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.100]   but they're not family.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:47.740]   So I don't feel any obligation to love them.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:51.260]   I can tolerate them, but to love them,
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.260]   I'm not obligated.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.040]   So we make a tight group of friends.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.460]   And we practice everything that we're taught.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.700]   Hey, I love them.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   You have to be patient with them, but only with these people.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:09.380]   Outside of this that I've created, that's not my response.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.820]   The church is too big anyway.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.420]   God only called me to these people.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:18.380]   By doing so, you're being disobedient.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:24.620]   We're a family of God, whether we're 60 or 600 or 6,000.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.460]   The only criteria for my brothers to be my brothers
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.100]   is that we have same parents.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.780]   I mean, one could be athletic,
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.500]   the other one may be rich or poor,
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.460]   someone maybe like to joke around,
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.060]   the other one's serious.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:47.500]   But we don't say, oh, my brother doesn't like joking around,
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.660]   so he's not my brother.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:52.060]   I like playing basketball, but he doesn't play basketball,
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.900]   so that's not my brother.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.100]   No, the only criteria for them to be my brother
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.660]   is that we have same parents.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.660]   And it's no different in the church.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:06.400]   They are my brothers as long as they have the same father,
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.180]   which is God.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.700]   And if that is the case,
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.660]   then everything that the Bible tells me
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.400]   applies to that person.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.580]   Imagine the early church.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:21.580]   The early church had Jews and Gentiles in the same church.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:27.860]   They hated each other for centuries.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.780]   And because of the resurrection of Christ,
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.780]   they were together.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.620]   Imagine how difficult that must have been.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.740]   I don't think that Christ resurrected
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.640]   and all of a sudden this benevolent love
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.860]   came over themselves and all that.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.180]   I love these Jews.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.760]   All that time of trying to avoid us
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.520]   and calling us unclean and filthy pagans,
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.940]   like, yeah, it just disappeared.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.080]   You think it just disappeared?
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:51.980]   I don't think so.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:56.960]   They did it in obedience, but it exists.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.280]   You know how I know that it exists?
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.000]   Because the very first problem
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.680]   that came into the early church
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   was that the Jews were not feeding the Hellenistic widows.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.600]   They considered them compromised
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.600]   because they started adapting to the Greek culture
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.360]   and they said, well, you guys are not as bad as the Gentiles
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.200]   but might as well 'cause you compromise.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.480]   And they wouldn't feed them.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.280]   And that was not a small problem.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.060]   'Cause if you don't feed the widows, what happens?
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:29.440]   They get annoyed, irritated, they die.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.520]   So if they didn't deal with this problem in a wise manner,
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.680]   it could have completely divided the church from the get-go.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.880]   And in fact, every letter that's written in the New Testament
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.840]   addresses that issue between Jews and Gentiles,
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.480]   Jews and Gentiles, that we're one, we're one, we're one,
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.280]   because they had such a hard time bringing them together.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.400]   But yet they did it.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.600]   Slaves and slave owners, I mean, think about that.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.680]   Think how difficult that would have been
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.040]   to go to someone's dinner
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.000]   and have the slave owner sitting there.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.520]   And the one who ran off coming for dinner.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:16.560]   Maybe the slave became more mature
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.320]   and he became a leader in the church
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.740]   and he's directing the dinner
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.120]   and the slave owner who used to own this guy
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.680]   is sitting there having to submit to his leadership.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.560]   Imagine what that would have done to the church.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.160]   It would have ruined the church.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.600]   The rich and the poor.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.040]   I mean, in our generation, we have the poor in one town,
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.800]   the rich in another town.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.320]   You know why that happens?
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:48.400]   Years ago, when I was actively in homeless ministry,
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.000]   when I used to take the students out to feed the homeless,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.440]   it was a very popular ministry.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.960]   People said, "Oh, we get to go to homeless
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.840]   "and we come back, we fed the homeless,
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.280]   "and then we go back, play basketball,
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.320]   "we go to our normal lives."
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.440]   Well, I had an idea to bring them to church.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.280]   And so we had guys who were off the street
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.800]   and they were mentally fine,
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.860]   but they didn't have any money.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:17.400]   But once they came into our community,
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.920]   it completely changed.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.160]   Because every time they have to go eat,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.760]   they have to pay for him.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.000]   He doesn't have a car, so you gotta pick him up.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.520]   He can't afford clothes, so you gotta buy him clothes.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.240]   We wanna play basketball, he didn't have shoes,
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.640]   so we have to buy him shoes.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.240]   So they couldn't talk about normal things
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.080]   that they would talk about.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.900]   "Oh, let's go get boba."
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.120]   You can't say that when he's around,
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.520]   'cause he can't afford boba,
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.840]   unless somebody's gonna feed him.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.640]   So it was one thing to temporarily
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.760]   be uncomfortable over there,
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.080]   but once they come here, it's like, "Ah."
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.680]   And they couldn't articulate it,
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.440]   but people were not happy about it,
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.680]   because it does disturb their peace.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:02.700]   How much of that happens here in our church?
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:06.200]   And I'm not talking about homelessness.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.500]   There's certain people that make you feel uncomfortable.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.020]   Maybe it's the way they talk.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.680]   Maybe it's their background.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.480]   Maybe it's their socioeconomics, that is.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.840]   Maybe it's their personality.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.320]   Maybe it's their family.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.480]   Maybe it's where they came from.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.880]   Maybe it's their age.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.460]   Maybe it's their experience.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.560]   Maybe you're a Dodgers fan,
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.760]   and they're a bunch of Angels fans.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.360]   And it could be as frivolous as something like that.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.300]   How much of our friendship and our unity
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.080]   is based upon, "I like him, I don't like him.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.280]   "He just says things, I don't like that."
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.200]   And so we come, and you've created your own community
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.320]   within the community.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.520]   He says, "When you do that, that's not the Lord's table
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.680]   "that you're participating in.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.480]   "You're just eating.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.140]   "You're just drinking grape juice.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.360]   "You're just participating.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.680]   "You're just having a piece of chip in your mouth.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.880]   "That's all it is."
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.560]   But when done correctly, when done correctly,
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.540]   we examine ourselves carefully.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.080]   Am I doing that?
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.640]   Am I guilty of that?
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.760]   Do I see them as my brothers in Christ?
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   There's reasons why God put us all together.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.440]   In the church, we have young and the old.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.480]   We have some who are educated, some are not.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.000]   Some are successful, some may not be.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.520]   Some who are poor, some are not.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.960]   We have various backgrounds, various cultures.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.880]   And there are some people who are sitting around you.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.600]   If you weren't a Christian, you would never cross paths.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.800]   And you would never want to cross paths,
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.640]   'cause you have nothing in common outside of Christ.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.720]   So the moment that we begin to drift away from Christ,
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.000]   it begins to get highlighted,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.480]   you have nothing in common with them.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.700]   So as soon as you stop talking about Jesus,
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.240]   there's nothing to talk about.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.240]   There's nothing to talk about.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.520]   You don't have same interests.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.080]   You're not similar in age.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.480]   You don't have similar background.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.000]   You don't have similar personality.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.960]   You don't get each other's jokes.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.640]   And so as soon as you stop talking about Jesus,
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.080]   all the differences become highlighted.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.120]   There's a remedy to that.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.080]   There's a clear and simple remedy to that.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.360]   Don't stop talking about Jesus.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:37.600]   Don't take Jesus out of your relationship.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.460]   Make Christ central.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.520]   Because the only reason why we're here together,
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.880]   that brings all of us together, is because of Christ.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.520]   So the moment we begin to drift away from Christ,
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.360]   we begin to talk about all our differences.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.480]   All the things that causes me to think that,
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.840]   you know, it's gonna be hard for me to be around you.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.360]   So the communion table is meant to bring us back together
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.940]   again and again and again and again.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.840]   It is not within our,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   it is our natural instinct to find our communities,
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.600]   our niche.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.240]   It goes against our nature to be surrounded by people
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.360]   that make us uncomfortable.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.400]   And yet, that's the power of the cross.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.920]   One of the greatest witnesses in the early church
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.400]   was their fellowship.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.480]   Why is a slave owner and a slave,
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.540]   why did the Jews and the Gentiles, even to this day,
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.640]   the secular scholars can't understand
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.760]   how the church got started.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.160]   So they'll say blanket statement,
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.640]   oh, it's 'cause they're all poor.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.160]   And then they realize Barnabas and all these people
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.440]   who are rich sold their land and they spread it out.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.840]   They say, okay, they weren't all poor.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.480]   Oh, it was all because they were up this political things.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.960]   And then they do some research,
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.280]   realize that wasn't the case.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.760]   Oh, the Jews and the Gentiles,
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.320]   like how did they get together?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.760]   They don't have an answer.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.820]   So the power of the early church was their fellowship.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.920]   The people who would have hated each other got together
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.720]   and called each other brothers and sisters in Christ
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.480]   and loved one another deeply.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:19.680]   Let me ask you, 'cause I'm at the end of this,
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.120]   how much of your life you've created to make you comfortable?
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:32.080]   How much of your life have you created to glorify God?
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.400]   Let me ask you that question again.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.120]   How much of the life that you've created,
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.740]   even inside the church, even as we're active,
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.200]   was created to make you feel comfortable?
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.960]   Make your children feel comfortable?
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.280]   How much of the decisions that you're making,
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.680]   how much of the money that you're spending
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.200]   is about building up the church and the body of Christ?
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.520]   When somebody is weak in the church,
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.720]   the strong is responsible to care for them,
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.600]   to come alongside them, to be patient with them.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.560]   Sometimes have to rebuke them,
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.160]   but to come alongside them, not to stiff arm them,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.280]   but to learn how to care for those who are weak,
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.600]   instead of just pointing fingers.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.240]   How do we learn patience?
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.320]   How do we bring our family together
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.680]   so that we can be a greater witness for Christ?
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.400]   Fourth and finally, when done correctly,
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.180]   it proclaims the gospel until he comes.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.640]   The word proclaim, kata angelo,
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.420]   basically means intense proclamation.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.680]   It basically means to keep the major, major,
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.000]   and minor, minor, which means you and I have a tendency,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.920]   every generation, and I've seen maybe about two or three
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.280]   huge movements come along just during the period
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.440]   that I've been a pastor,
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.280]   and every time these movements come,
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.880]   people jump on board, oh, this is what we need,
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.000]   this is what the church needs to be,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.720]   this is what we have to do.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.000]   The latest movement in our generation
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.620]   was the social justice movement,
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.320]   with all that was going around the world,
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.020]   and say, we need to do this, how come we're not doing this?
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.440]   The problem wasn't that we should care for the poor,
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.640]   of course we should care for the poor.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.920]   Of course we should care about sex trafficking
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.040]   and all that has gone wrong,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.420]   but when that replaces the gospel,
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:25.480]   when the movement and what's going on around the world
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.120]   causes us to stray from the real power of God,
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:33.340]   all you've done is commit to put a band-aid on cancer,
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.020]   and the only answer to this fallen world
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.920]   is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.340]   Poverty exists because of sin.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.060]   Sex trafficking happens because of sin.
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.980]   Racism happens because of sin.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:48.580]   Division happens because of sin.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.580]   War happens because of sin.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.940]   We're divided because of sin.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:55.100]   Family marriages break apart because of sin.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.420]   The core of every human suffering is sin,
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.500]   and the only power to deliver mankind from sin
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.860]   is the gospel.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.360]   Not politicians, not money, not better organization,
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.240]   not the right politicians in the right place,
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.560]   but it's the power of God.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.640]   Foolishness to the world, to those who are perishing,
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.360]   but power of God for those who are being saved.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:25.600]   So the communion puts the gospel and constantly reminds us
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.540]   to put Christ at the center.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:36.240]   Help people, be generous, work, vote,
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.860]   do all of that thing, but never forget
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:46.360]   that the true power is in the blood and the body of Christ.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.520]   So this morning, as we participate in the communion table,
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.020]   as I ask the praise team to come up to prepare,
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:59.560]   I pray that you would take a few minutes to reflect.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.220]   (pages rustling)
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.420]   Take every part of what you heard this morning seriously.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:10.420]   Have you come into this room this morning
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.720]   completely distracted?
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.080]   The thought of communion was the last thing on your mind?
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:19.820]   Just get this over with, 'cause I got an appointment,
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:23.700]   and you drifted, and Christ is not central,
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.700]   to take some time to ask the Lord
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.500]   to get you focused on Christ,
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.300]   and maybe you've taken your eyes off of him,
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.980]   or you have a hazy vision of who he is,
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.360]   to fix your eyes upon Christ.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.920]   Take this opportunity to ask the Lord
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.140]   that it would fix my eyes upon Christ,
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:42.000]   the author and perfecter of my faith.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.580]   When's the last time you prayed,
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.040]   search me and know me, try me,
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.540]   and see if there's any anxious thoughts in me,
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.220]   and see if there's any hurtful way in me,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.260]   and lead me in the everlasting way?
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.540]   When's the last time you came before the Lord,
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.380]   not just asking to change your circumstance,
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.780]   but change your heart?
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.220]   Change your attitude, change your perspective,
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.780]   change your compromise,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.020]   things that you've just kind of allowed,
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:10.800]   search me, Lord, see if there's any hurtful ways in me,
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.540]   and be ready to confess that and put that behind.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:20.580]   Is there bitterness, division,
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.620]   people you've stiff-armed, you've allowed,
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.140]   because you intensely love this person,
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.420]   that you excuse not loving the other person?
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:32.540]   Have one side of obedience,
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.400]   you've justified the disobedience on this other side?
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.660]   Is there division in your heart?
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.900]   To come before the Lord,
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.580]   to participate in a worthy manner,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.420]   to recognize the whole body of Christ,
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.380]   not just the ones that you've selected.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.600]   Is the gospel central?
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.400]   Is it truly central?
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.000]   Or is it just an addendum of your life?
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.120]   After you've done everything,
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.380]   after you've pursued everything,
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.680]   and then you sprinkle some Jesus on all of it.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.660]   Or is it central?
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.980]   Is what's major, major, minor, minor?
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.060]   Or has that been flipped?
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.900]   Let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.980]   and ask the Lord to let the communion
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.100]   have the effect that it was meant to have,
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.300]   and to revive our hearts, renew our hearts,
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.740]   unite the church, and keep Christ centered.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:29.500]   So I'm gonna give you a few minutes to pray, get ready,
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.420]   and then I'll call everybody together
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:32.940]   and we'll participate in the communion together.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.840]   So let's take some time to pray first.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:41.020]   (gentle piano music)

[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:29.980]   - Before we participate, if you can get ready,
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.940]   just take off the first lid and then get that ready,
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:37.460]   and then you open up the other part.
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.860]   But before we participate in it,
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:41.380]   what we're doing now, obviously,
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.060]   is just a temporary thing that we're doing
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.540]   because of the surroundings
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.140]   and what's going on around us,
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.380]   so we're trying to be careful.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.820]   But at the same time, this is not the ideal way
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.060]   that we wanna do communion.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.620]   In previous, before all this happened,
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:55.980]   we would have a table set up,
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.900]   and then we would ask you,
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.740]   even though it takes a little bit longer,
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.780]   we ask people to stand up and come to the front
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:03.500]   and get your elements and then go back to your seat.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.220]   And the reason why we do that
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:09.620]   is we want you to be deliberate, willful,
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.180]   that you actually take the steps
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.460]   to come to the table to participate,
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:14.900]   that you would pray and be mindful.
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.060]   So that's the reason why we did it before,
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.340]   and I know that some churches you go to,
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.100]   they'll bring the elements to you,
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.400]   and again, there's nothing wrong with that,
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.460]   but we don't want people to participate in a passive way
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.660]   where you're sitting, you get it,
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.420]   and you just open it and you put it in your mouth,
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.820]   but that you actually take time to consider,
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.380]   and by standing in line, coming,
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:35.820]   that we're participating in the same table.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.140]   So what we're doing, this is not ideal.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.580]   We're just doing this,
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.160]   hopefully by next time we do this,
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.140]   that we would feel comfortable enough to come to the front.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.620]   We're gonna do that.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.640]   But this morning, as we participate in it,
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.740]   I wanted to give an encouragement and a warning
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.180]   that this is meant for baptized believers,
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.620]   because it is a memorial.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:58.860]   It is kind of like an anniversary
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.620]   of a reflection of your union with Christ.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.940]   So if you've never had this union with Christ,
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.100]   you never confessed your sins and been forgiven,
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:10.060]   and you have this personal relationship with Christ,
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.080]   that this is meant for those who have done that
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.620]   to remind us, but if that has never happened,
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:18.640]   there is no power in this of yourself
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.320]   if you take participating in it.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.120]   So I ask that you guys just kind of sit there
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:26.160]   and be reflective, and even if you're not a believer,
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.920]   you must be here for a reason.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.480]   Maybe you're curious.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.720]   Maybe somebody brought you to church.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.800]   Maybe you fell away,
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.320]   but you're starting to come back to church.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.800]   For whatever the reason is,
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.920]   I believe you're here for a purpose,
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.340]   and so take that time to reflect, to ask questions.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.180]   What is it?
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:44.800]   If God is real, why did he bring you here?
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800]   The message that you heard,
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.540]   what does that have to do with you?
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.980]   And maybe take this opportunity
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.540]   to really personally come before the Lord and pray.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.320]   And then for the rest of you, again,
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.420]   that each communion that we have,
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.100]   that we will participate in a manner,
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.740]   at least seriously, right,
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.540]   to consider how sacred this is
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.500]   and how it is set apart for the church,
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.620]   and ask the Lord, not only for us personally,
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.140]   but as a community,
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.500]   that it would have the effect
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.580]   that God had intended it to do,
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.380]   that we would be united,
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:17.540]   that we would take our sins seriously,
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.220]   to confess our sins,
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:22.380]   that if we've drifted to make Christ central,
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.940]   and that we would recommit ourselves to the gospel.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.300]   It says, "For I received from the Lord
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.100]   "that which I also delivered to you,
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.460]   "that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.400]   "in which he was betrayed took bread,
