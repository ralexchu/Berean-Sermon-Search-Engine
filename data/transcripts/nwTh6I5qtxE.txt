[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   We're going to be reading from verse 1 through 4.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And main text today is going to be on one verse, verse 4.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Again, I promise we are going to be going faster than just one verse a week.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It's just that we want to make sure that we cover this and set the right foundation
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   before we get to the other heroes of the faith.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So Hebrews chapter 11, verses 1 through 4.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So I want to read all four verses before we get started this morning.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Reading out of the NASV.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your anointing over this time.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   May your word have its effect on us.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Help us, Lord God, to hear from you and to glean from this verse, this passage,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   what it is that you have desired.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I pray that you would give us eagerness, Lord God, to hear from you,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   that we may apply all that you have to say.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   All right, again, I want to apologize if you are not a Lakers fan.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I'm going to mention this just for today.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Just for today and then next week maybe consider it again.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But again, as you guys know, Lakers won their 17th championship
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   tying the record for the Celtics.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So now they're tied.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   So next year they'll break it, I'm assuming.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   But after every game that happens, obviously they'll put up the banner up there.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   It's the 17th championship banner.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And then they'll have the Hall of Famers whose jerseys have been retired.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And obviously Kobe's was retired.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And then eventually other people will get retired.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And the reason why they do that is obviously to venerate,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   just to kind of honor that these are the teams that win,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   won the championship team.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And the new people that have come and they retired their jerseys
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and put it up there to inspire people.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   When they look up, this is what Lakers is about.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   This is what you should aspire for.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   But obviously you can look at that and the new players coming in
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and get intimidated and think, "I will never be able to live up to that."
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Now obviously these guys are Hall of Fame basketball players.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So it's not assumed that every basketball player,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   in fact more than 99% of the players that come in and play for Lakers
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   are not going to have their jerseys retired like that.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   But the reason why they do that is not simply to intimidate but to inspire.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   So they're kind of like the Hall of Fame or the heroes basically of Lakers,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   if you're a Lakers fan.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   I say all of this because Chapter 11 is a Hall of Fame for people of faith.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And so everything that the author has been saying has been leading up to Chapter 11
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   saying that not to drift, but here's some examples of people who live by faith
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   and what does this faith look like.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And then after he does that, starting from Chapter 12,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   he's going to point back to them saying, "Considering the cloud of witnesses,"
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   this Hall of Fame people who live by faith,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "that we ought to follow that example and continue to persevere in our faith."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   So today is the first person in the Hall of Fame.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   So he's like the first retired jersey that we're looking at today.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So we're looking at verse 4 and starts out of the story between Abel and Cain,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   how Abel's offering was acceptable and Cain's offering was not.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Just to kind of--before we even jump into it, that we understand what's going on.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   The story of Cain and Abel is the first generation of people who were born into sin.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Now Adam and Eve were not born into sin.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   They fell because they chose to sin.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   So the first generation of people, the first fruits of Adam and Eve after they fell
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   was a murderer.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And it is not by accident.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   The stories that we see in the Old Testament and New Testament
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   are not a collection of random things that happen
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and just kind of telling us this is what happened.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So whenever we study the Bible, we're doing inductive study of 1 Thessalonians,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   one of the key things that we have to constantly ask is,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   how does this fit into the context?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Not only the context of the immediate text of the letter of the Old Covenant and New Covenant,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   but in his redemptive, in the meta-narrative of the Bible,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   in the redemptive history, where does this fit?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Why is this story here?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Other than to just tell us that Adam and Eve had children and they ended up,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   you know, the first one ended up murdering.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Well, we're going to see here what he says here is really foundational to our faith.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   What he says in this one verse really sets the table
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   of how we understand the rest of redemptive history.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And so hopefully we will be able to unpack that together this morning.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   So I want to look at verse 4 again, just verse 4.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And then we're going to deal with two things that he says here this morning.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Verse 4, "By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain."
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   So that's the first point we're going to look at.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   It was a better sacrifice. What made this a better sacrifice?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And then 2, "Through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous."
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Through the better sacrifice, Abel became righteous.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   God testifying about his gift and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   What is it about his testimony, what is it about him becoming righteous
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   that is still speaking to us today?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   So that's the second part we're going to be looking at.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So let's look at the first part.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   He says, "Abel offered a better sacrifice."
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   So in order for us to better understand what is going on here,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   it's good for us to understand what is a sacrifice.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Sacrifice, another way of saying a sacrifice is an offering.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Now in our modern day worship, we don't use the word sacrifice.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Typically when we say sacrifice, we're talking about giving up something that is valuable to us.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   But here, in the context of sacrifice, it's talking about offering.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And offering is what is given in the context of worship.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   So, another way to say this is, God looked at the offering that Abel gave and he says,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   "Abel's offering was a better offering."
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   "Abel's offering was a better offering."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   So what is laid here, basically is telling us, through the story of Cain and Abel,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   what worship is acceptable and what worship is not acceptable.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And the reason why this is so foundational,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   the Bible says that we are created for the purpose of worship.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So if our central identity, central identity,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   is not what nationality, what language you speak, or your economic status,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   our first identity was as a worshiper.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   God says he created us in his image, to bear his image.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   In other words, we were to reflect his glory.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And so when he says to Adam and Eve that this is acceptable worship,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   this is not acceptable worship, he's laying the foundation for sinners to be able to come to him.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Again, this is why this is so important.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Worship is at the core of who we are.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Now, in order to better understand what worship is,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   again, I'm going to use the analogy of sports, right?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   If you are a casual fan, let's say if you're...
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I would say I'm not a fanatic, I would say I'm a fan.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I enjoy watching Lakers, but my car is not purple and gold,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I don't have purple and gold underwear, I don't have purple and gold socks.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   You see some fanatics when you go to the arena,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   I mean, they are fanatics, they'll paint their face,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   they'll take off their shirt, they'll have their favorite player's number printed on their chest.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   There's no shame, right?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And we would say they're not just fans, they're not just casual fans, they are fanatics.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   If you go into their room, their room is painted purple and gold, right?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And they know the shoe sizes of every player,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   they know when they got married, how many children they have,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and their stats, and they know everything, right?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   So a fan is somebody who just casually enjoys it from a distance,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and if they happen to be in championship, we kind of get on board,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   and we find excitement in that.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   But a fanatic is day and night, 24/7, that's what he does.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   So the difference between a fan and a fanatic,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   a fanatic, that's his primary thing that brings him the greatest joy.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   That's it. That's what brings him the greatest joy.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   He's willing to become a fool.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He's willing to spend a lot of money.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   In fact, most fanatics, their friends will actually tell them to calm down, right?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Most fans are like, "Yeah, you know, we're going to get together and watch,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   you know, watch basketball together," but if you're a fanatic,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   you probably have some friends that are concerned about you.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   You know, "You're spending too much money. You're--too much time.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Too much energy in that."
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   See, in the context of worship, God did not call us to be fans.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   He called us to be fanatics.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Because the Bible says--what is the greatest commandment?
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength."
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   He says what God is looking for, people are going to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   He said, "You will seek me and find me if you seek for me with what?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   With all your heart."
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   God is commanding us to be fanatics of who he is.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Now, when we look at that, because typically when we think of a fanatic,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   we're thinking about somebody who went too far.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   But the reason why he commands and desires fanatics of who he is
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   is because he is the author of life.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And the moment that we are separated from him, there we find death.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   So the only way that we can truly experience true life
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   is to reconnect with the author of life.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   So his commandment to love him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   is really for our benefit, because that's what he created us for.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   So in the church, it doesn't take much to make fans.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   If we have enough people your age with similar interests,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   if there's nice people on our welcome team,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   if the leaders aren't too boring and they have an embezzled money,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and it's like, "Ah, we can follow that," and they're somewhat interesting,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   it doesn't take a lot to make fans of people.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   But a fanatic is not something that you can create,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   unless that person really finds the greatest joy in this.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Only an individual who has genuinely encountered this God
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   will become a fanatic.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And that's the struggle that we have in our generation,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   because there seems to be no distinction between a fan and a fanatic.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   In fact, every once in a while, there is somebody maybe who takes it too far
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and says, "You should go into ministry.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   You should become a missionary, because you're not like the rest of us."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Not realizing that that person may be doing exactly what God has called all of us to do.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   You know, you can become a fanatic of pretty much anything.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   If you are a fanatic of making money,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   you are willing to do whatever it takes to make money.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   If you are a fanatic of friendship, if you are a fanatic of prestige,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   if that's where you find your greatest joy and greatest life,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   you are willing to sacrifice anything.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   You are willing to become a fool.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Years ago, when we first started going out to India,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and I remember the very first year we went,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   even our missionary friends were telling us, "Don't go there,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   because there's not a lot of support out there."
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And there's a few of us that went there that first year,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and we literally went into the boonies.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   We got off in Bangalore, and we took five hours to drive out to Bellary,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   and then from Bellary we had at least about two hours to drive to the village,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and it really felt like the boonies.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I would say about a third of the road was paved,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   and the other two-thirds was like dirt road.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And we were going hours and hours into the countryside,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and we were thinking, "Man, if anything happens here,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   I mean, we would be completely lost."
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Well, once we got there, obviously we're the only foreigners,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   you don't see anything familiar there,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and typically whenever you travel,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   the first thing that you look for is either McDonald's or Starbucks,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   because there's some familiarity, or at least some English,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   something that you're familiar with.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   First year we went there, we saw nothing.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   But as the years went by, we started seeing the roads being paved.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   In fact, now I would say more than two-thirds,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   maybe about 90% of the road has been paved.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And now the same hotel that we go to, we will see foreigners hanging out there.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   So the first time I saw a foreigner like us,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   my initial thought was,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   the only reason why anybody would be out here,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   it's the same reason we're here, is to share the gospel.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   But we realized that through the years
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   that India is starting to rise in their economy,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   so the more and more business people are coming into that area.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It's a mining town.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Hyundai came in and set up a huge factory out there,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   and that's part of the reason why the roads got paved.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   But I can imagine the first group of people
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   who came out there to make money.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   They had to do the same thing we did.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   They had to come to a foreign place that they weren't familiar with,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   eat foods that they weren't familiar with,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   leave their family behind for a period to establish all that.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Now it's becoming more and more foreigner-friendly,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   but there were people who came out there
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and did the same thing that we did,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   all for the purpose of making money.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   People all over the world will sacrifice,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   leave their families behind,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   sometimes even ruin their marriages
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   because they are fanatics of money.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And in a place like that, I can only say,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   either you are a fan of money,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   or you're a fanatic of God.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   That would bring somebody out to a place like that permanently,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   although we're only there for a short period of time.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   See, God knows that if we are not a fanatic of God,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   most likely we are a fanatic of something else.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Because God created us for the purpose of worship.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   You and I gain the greatest satisfaction in life
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   when we live according to the way He created us.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   So when we are not finding the satisfaction in life in Christ,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   and we are just casual fans,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   we are most likely fanatics of something else.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   You either watching Korean drama, K-pop,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I don't know what it is that you like,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   maybe going to new places, or finding friends or community,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   whatever it might be.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Buying new things, whatever it might be.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   If we are not, if we don't find life in being a fanatic of Christ,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   whether you are aware or not aware of it,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   most likely you are a fanatic of something else.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Fanatic of security, fanatic of success,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   fanatic of money, fanatic of reputation,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   whatever that may be.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   That you are willing to sacrifice, possibly cheat and lie,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   in order to either hold on to it or to attain it.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   See, what God is saying here about Abel's offering
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   is really a statement not only about Abel,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   but He's distinguishing between a worship that will lead to life
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   and a worship that will lead to death.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   See, the background behind this,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   just so that we better understand what's going on here,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   in Genesis 4, 4-5 it describes Abel's offering.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   It says, "Abel on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and of their fat portions."
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Let me stop right there.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   That's verse 4.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And then verse 3, it describes Cain's offering.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   "So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   to the Lord of fruit of the ground."
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I don't know if we can put the two verses together simultaneously,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   but if you notice the difference between the sacrifice that is given by Abel,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   he says, "On his part he brought a firstling."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   "Firstling" meaning the very first, right?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Of whatever it is that he had of the flock.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And then it is the fat portion.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   So in those three descriptions,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   it's describing Abel's offering as the best of the flock,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   and even of that, the most precious part of that animal.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   But of Cain's, look what it says.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   "It came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering."
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Not a first offering, not the best offering,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   it just says, "An offering to the Lord of the fruit of the ground."
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   When you read that casually, just kind of reading through the Bible,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   you may not catch that.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   But when we slow down and ask the question,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   what made Abel's offering acceptable,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   and what made Cain's offering unacceptable,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   is the distinction between giving the best versus just giving.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   A fan versus a fanatic.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Cain gave out of convenience.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   This is what he did for a living.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   So God required it, so I'm just going to give it to him.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Where Abel also gave of the flock, and he was a herder,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   but he gave what was best.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   And even of the portion, he didn't keep the best portion to himself,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   but the fattest portion, he offered it to God.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   And it is in that, that by at least the initial distinction,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   is between their attitude and the way that they gave.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It says in Isaiah 29 verse 13,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   God has been saying this to the nation of Israel over and over and over again.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   The reason why they're going into captivity,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   is because they kept on giving God defective worship.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Isaiah 29 verse 13, "Then the Lord said, 'Because these people draw near with their words,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and honor me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts far from me,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and their reverence for me consists of traditions learned by rote.'"
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Meaning habit.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   You just did it because it's Sunday.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   How often times do we come to worship simply because it's Sunday?
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   How often do we come saying, "I'm going to worship God."
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Or, "I'm going to attend worship."
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   There is a difference between the two.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   See, we can attend worship by just getting up, being clothed, and coming and sitting,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and then when the worship starts, you sit, and when the worship ends, you go home,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and you say, "You attended worship."
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   But there's a difference between attending worship and actually worshiping God.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   There's a huge difference between a fan and a fanatic.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   A fan may come on board when it's exciting,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   and when it's not exciting, you can't tell.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Jesus says the same thing in the book of Matthew, chapters 15, 8 through 9.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   "This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   All they're doing is following rules.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Rules that men made up.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   So, our order of worship, we made it up.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   I made it up.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   What do I think is the best way?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Should we start first? Should we do the offering in the middle?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Should we do it at the end?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Should we have membership at church? How should we organize our Bible study?
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   All of these things are obviously ways for us to get to God,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   but these are just rules created by men.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   So, if you go to another church, there's another set of rules.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   If you go to another church, they have another set of rules.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And so, he says, "All these people are doing is just following rules and attending worship,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   but they are not worshiping me."
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   And that's the distinction that he's making.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   An offering that we give, let's say if you're giving a gift to a friend,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   and you're giving it to that person, and you put some thought into it.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   You know, you sacrificed, you saved up money,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and the offering that you give to that person, or the gift that you give to that person,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   has a lot of meaning behind it because you poured your heart into it.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   I had a friend, and I mentioned this before,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   who would always carry around precious moment dolls in his car.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   He would always have three or four in his car
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   because he would constantly forget anniversaries and birthdays,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   or maybe he said something dumb to his wife, and his wife would be ticked off.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   And so, he had an immediate way out.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   He would go to the back of his car, take out one of those precious moment dolls,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and he would give it to her. Right?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   So, he figured out a way to appease her wrath.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And that's all he's doing.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   He's not loving her. He's not taking care of her.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   That's self-centered.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   I want to eat breakfast tomorrow, and the only way that I'm going to do that is appease this wrath.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   And so, he figured out a way.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   I mean, she's okay. She's not happy with it.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   And she knew he was doing that, but he said, "Okay."
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   You know, because she loved the doll so much. Right?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   But that's not God.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   God is not in love with dead animals.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   He's not in love with singing.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   He's actually looking for the offering that we bring in our hearts.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   And that's why he was constantly telling the nation of Israel that what you are doing is not worship.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   In fact, he actually says that assembly of God's people at the temple was a burden to him.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   He actually says, calls it an evil assembly.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   The distinction that he's making between Abel and Cain's offering is a distinction between life and death.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   You can see what was going on in Cain's heart by the way he responded
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   when God points that out to him.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   In fact, if you look at it carefully, God is actually very gracious to him.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Look what he says.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   "Then the Lord said to Cain, 'Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?'"
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   If you do well.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Basically meaning, if you follow what I told you to do.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   If you did what Abel did.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   God is giving him an opportunity to repent.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   He's not saying, "You did it wrong, so you're going to die tomorrow."
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   He says, "No."
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   He said, "Your whole situation would change if you would just repent."
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Instead of being angry and jealous and having a serious countenance.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   If you do well, wouldn't your situation change?
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And if you do not do well, if you choose to remain on this path,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   he says, "Sin is crouching at the door, and its desire is for you, but you must master it."
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   If your pride and anger and jealousy, if you embrace that and allow that to percolate and bear fruit,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   he says, "Sin is basically going to master you."
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Either you repent and get it right and master it,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   or you allow it to percolate and bear fruit.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   And we know exactly what happens.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Cain chooses to embrace this sin, and in his anger, he becomes the first murderer in human history.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   In fact, in the book of Jude, verse 10 and 11, it describes,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   God describes Cain's sin this way,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   "But these men revile the things which they do not understand, and the things which they know by instinct.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Woe to them, for they have gone the way of Cain."
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   What is the way of Cain? Like an animal.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   He just does whatever he feels.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   And that's the difference between an animal and a human being.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   He says, he just does whatever, right? An unreasoning animal who knows by instinct.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   He just does whatever he feels like.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Whatever comes easiest.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   I mean, animals don't have priorities.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   They don't sit down and make a list of, "These are important things that I need to get to today,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   and these are not important things that I don't need to get to.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   These are things that I prioritize. These are things I don't need."
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   They don't live like that.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   So, if it's something that they like, they want it.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   They get excited about something, they run.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   They get scared, they stop.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   They get tired, they sleep.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   If they're tired of sleeping, they get up, and they run.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   That's what he's describing, the sin of Cain.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   He's living by his flesh, whatever satisfies him.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   The Bible describes the sin of Israel repeatedly, over and over again, in the same way.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   He says in the book of Judges, their primary sin,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   every time God would be gracious and bring us revival,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   they would fall right back into that sin because everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Instead of following Christ, or following God's precepts,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   everyone did what was right in their own eyes, over and over and over again.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   The Bible describes man's rebellion as simply doing and following and chasing what we want.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And most of the greatest temptations in life are not obviously sinful.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   It's just, "That's what I want. That's what I desire.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   I'm going to give to God whatever is convenient to me."
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   And beyond that, that's for the fanatics.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   So I'm satisfied with just being a fan of who he is.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I'm going to give you another outdated song, Frank Sinatra.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Most of you guys probably know who he is.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   You guys know who Frank Sinatra is? Okay.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   This guy is big enough that you guys would know.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   He has a song called "I Did It My Way."
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   I'm not going to read the whole thing, but just the first verse.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   "And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   My friends, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   I've lived a life that's full. I traveled each and every highway.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   But more, much more than this, I did it my way."
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   What he describes here in this song, the Bible describes as a way of destruction.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   It is broad. It is easy. It is convenient.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And you just make decisions, and you just do whatever comes natural to you.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   And what our flesh naturally desires is a road to destruction.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   In Proverbs 12-14, it says, "There is a way which seems right to a man,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   but its end is the way of death.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Even in laughter, the heart may be in pain."
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   You ever experience that, even as a Christian,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   where you know you're not walking right with God?
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And maybe you made some money, maybe your business did well,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   maybe your children were sick and then they became healthy,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   but even in the midst of that, you know that you are not walking the way God wants you to walk,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   and even in the midst of success, you experience emptiness and pain.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   That's what he's describing here.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Because true life is only when we are connected to the author of life.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   So if you experience, if you're chasing after life outside of Christ,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   that's what he's describing here.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   And in the end, joy may be grief.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   That all your life, you experience one success after another success,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   and after another success, and all your life, you can tell other people,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   "If you do what I do, you can be successful.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   You can make all the money, and your life may be written in a book,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   saying that if you really want to be successful, do this,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   because this is what I did."
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   And at the end of that, he says, "It's grief."
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Because the only true life is found when we are connected to the author of life.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   The backslider in heart will have his fill of his own ways.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   A backslider in heart will have his fill of his own way.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   He will continue to make decisions and go after things according to what he desires,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   but a good man will be established, or will be satisfied, with his.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   The distinction between Abel's offering and Cain's offering
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   is a distinction between life and death.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   God warns Cain that sin is crouching at your door,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   that this temptation is going to overpower you and lead you to destruction.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   See, what we need to pay attention to here is faulty worship was what led to the first murder.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Let me say that again. Faulty worship is what led to the first murder.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Now you may say, "You know, that's kind of hyperbole. You're exaggerating."
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Right? It's not directly connected.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   But I think that's exactly the point that he's trying to make.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Because God created us for the purpose of worship,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   when we're not satisfied with the Creator, we end up chasing after the creation.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   And when we chase after the creation, there comes covening, there comes slander, there comes murder.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   All the other sins come as a result of forsaking the ultimate object of our worship.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Whatever causes us to give defective worship is an open door to all kinds of temptations.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   We cannot give true worship on our terms.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   We do not come and reconcile by our terms and by whatever is the most convenient for us.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   But here's the second part.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Abel's sacrifice left a testimony and speaks to us even to this day.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   It made him righteous. So we may look at that and say,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   "Well, maybe because Abel was smart, and Abel gave what was best, and he worked harder than Cain."
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   That's not what he's pointing to. He says it made him righteous,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   and it gave him a testimony which still speaks to us today.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   So what is it about that that points to speaking to us today and furthermore?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   It's pretty clear.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Now we know that animal sacrifice, like there is no mention of that in Genesis 3,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   saying this is the only way of atonement.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   But in Genesis 3, we have what's called the proto-evangelium, which translation means first gospel.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   As soon as they fall, God has a plan.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   The serpent is going to bruise the heel of the woman's seed,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   and the seed is going to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   And that's a description of how Jesus is going to come, and he's going to overpower the accuser.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Now, that's not explained, but when we know what's going on in the New Testament,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   we look back at that and say, "Clearly he left evidence of that."
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   And so when we get to chapter 4, he says, "Abel gives blood sacrifice, which is acceptable to him."
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   It doesn't describe for us how much they understood what was going on.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   Even though we studied through the book of Leviticus,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Leviticus, all the offerings that were given in the book of Leviticus, was not the first time they did that.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   You see it in Deuteronomy, you see it in Exodus, you see it all over Genesis,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and you see it as early as Genesis chapter 4.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   That there was an understanding that is not explained to us.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   There was an understanding that blood sacrifice was necessary.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   And so when Abel gave his offering, not only was it the best,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   not only did he follow the prescription, his blood sacrifice pointed to something that was coming.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   And clearly, you and I know what that is.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   In Hebrews chapter 9, 22, in Leviticus 17, 11, it says,
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   "Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins."
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   The only way that even with our best effort that we can reconcile with this God
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   is through the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 24, "And to Jesus, the medium of our new covenant,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   and to the sprinkle of blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel."
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Abel was just a precursor, a foreshadow of what he was going to do to reconcile people to himself.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   So right off the bat, in Genesis chapter 3 and chapter 4,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   God is foreshadowing a way for sinners to be reconciled to him from the get-go.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   So the gospel is not introduced to us in John 3, 16.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   The good news was embedded according to Ephesians when?
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Before even the creation of the world, before you and I could even understand.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Even before this event, God had plans to reconcile sinners to himself.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   So chapter 4 is describing to us, or verse 4 in this passage is describing to us,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   a way for mankind to reestablish the worship.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Because it is only when we become true worshipers of God, we truly live.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   So many people interpret John chapter 10, verse 10, when Jesus says,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   "I have come to give life, and to give this life abundantly."
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   And they wonder why, if God came to give me life abundantly,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   how come I'm having such a hard time paying bills?
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   How come I have such a hard time with my family?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   How come I have such a hard time to getting promoted at work?
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Because he said he's going to make my life abundant.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   But the abundant life that he's referring to is not an abundant life here.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   It's the only life that you can have when you are reconnected with the author of life.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   And only when you're reconnected with the author of life.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   So the greater of a fan, greater of a worship that we are of him,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   the more we experience this life.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   I don't know about you, but the happiest people that I know in this world
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   are people who are crazy about Jesus.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   Almost to the point like, "Hey, calm down. Calm down.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   Our worship's at 11. You don't need to show up at 10 o'clock. Calm down."
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   Every new Bible comes out, they got to get the new one.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   They got to get to every conference. They're at every single conference.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   They're always at the front. They're always singing the loudest.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   Like, "Calm down."
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   And there's a joy that exuberates that comes from them that is not fake.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   You can't fake that.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   You can get fans to show up on time if you are A students.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   You can get fans to open up the Bible, attend Bible study,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   and be responsible and become good citizens,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   and attend, do this, and do everything that's expected.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   But a fanatic, fanatic of Christ,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   is not something that you and I create.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   That's something that happens because we encounter this God.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   See, the Apostle Paul was a fanatic.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   He didn't become who he was because Jesus spent a lot of time with him,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   telling him right and wrong, and telling him the good word.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   No, he encountered, he encountered the glory of Christ.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   And it became rubbish. He wasn't discipled to think rubbish.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   It became rubbish.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   And from that point on, he was willing even to give his life
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   to tell other people about this because whatever comes after this,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   meeting Christ, is way better than whatever it was that he was pursuing.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   See, he's calling us to be fanatics.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   To come deeper. And that's why he says,
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   when the door has opened, he says,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   "Come to the throne of grace with confidence."
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Because the whole purpose of salvation is in that statement.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   The whole purpose of salvation is in,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   now you're no longer condemned.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   Do whatever you want. That's not the gospel.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   The gospel is because of what he has done.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   The door has been opened. Now come.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   so I can give you rest.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   Come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   That's the good news of the gospel.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   That the door to life has been opened. Now come.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Not to simply admire it. Not to simply write about it.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   Not to simply take pictures and put it on the wall.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   But to come.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Because true life is found in Christ.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   In Christ alone.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   That's what Cain and Abel's offering was pointed to.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   That speaks to us to this day.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Hebrews 9, 13-14,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   "For if the blood of goats and bulls and ashes of
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   "hyphor, sprinkling those who have been defiled,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   "sanctified for the cleansing of the flesh,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   "how much more will the blood of Christ,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   "who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to God,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   "cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   How much more?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   And then finally, 1 Peter 1, 18-20,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   "Knowing that you are not redeemed with the perishable things like silver or gold
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   "from your feudal way of life,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   "inherited from your forefathers,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   "but with the precious blood as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   "the blood of Christ."
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   You know, it almost seems like a contradiction or an oxymoron to say
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   that the way of life is Abel's offering.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   Because Abel died.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   Cain was the one who murdered, and he lived.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   He got to live a long life.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Abel gave the right offering, and he died.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   So how can you say that this leads to life?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   From a worldly perspective,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   if all we know is here,
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   then what a tragedy.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   The guy who was right before God,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   the guy who gave his best,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   the guy who gave the blood sacrifice,
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   he's the one who ended his life early.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   When we see it from a man's perspective.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   But from God's perspective, from an eternal perspective,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   we can say that Abel died with life.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Cain lived in death.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   Living a long life.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   There's a lot of people who don't want to be here.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   Because that's their personal testimony.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Living a long life is not a blessing in and of itself.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Existing in this fallen world with all the depravity,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   with all the chaos, with all the hurts,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   with all the families that are broken up,
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   with all the past pains that they have to live with,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   living a long life is not a blessing in and of itself.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   God did not call us so that we can live long.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   God called us so that we can live, truly live.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   There's a joy in him.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   And the only path that causes us to do that
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   is a path of Abel.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   By faith, he offered up a better sacrifice,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   which caused him to be righteous.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   And this righteousness and the blood sacrifice
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   and right worship of Abel speaks to us even to this day,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   even when we die.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   That's the gospel message.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   So as we look at the other people in Hebrews chapter 11,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   if we miss this point,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   you may study the book of Hebrews and say,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   "Oh, if I just believed, if I had more faith,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   I can conquer enemies and I can do all this."
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   And you miss the whole point.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   Because the point of this, there's the first part of it
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   where it will teach us that God used them and delivered them
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   and did all of this stuff.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   And then the second part will come out,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   but some of these people died early,
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   were tortured, were beaten.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   But all of it did it because they believed.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   They believed that life was in God.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   The promised land was not a physical land,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   but a land that he will bring.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   So I pray that as we look at this foundation,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   that that would embed into our hearts.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   And again, and I'm going to say this over and over again,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   as I've always been saying, and his point is the same.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus,
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Let's pray.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for grace that only you can give.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   We pray for eyes that are open.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   Lord, we are surrounded by so much temptation.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Lord, we struggle with controlling our own flesh and our own mind.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   I pray that the power of your word would renew us
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   and revive us and restore us.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   Help us, Lord God, as Abel's sacrifice speaks to us,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   that it would be ringing in our mind and our hearts,
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   that we would be able to confess that we love you
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Let us all rise for our closing praise.

[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   Amen.
