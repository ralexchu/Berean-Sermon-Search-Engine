[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.620]   By grace alone somehow I stand where
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.600]   even angels fear to tread.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:44.080]   Invited by redeeming love before the throne of God above.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.060]   He holds me close with nail-scarred hands
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.540]   into his everlasting arms.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:11.500]   When condemnation grips my heart and Satan tempts me
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.980]   to despair, I hear the voice that scatters fear.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.960]   Oh, the great I Am, the Lord, is here.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.940]   Oh, praise the one who fights for me
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.900]   and shields my soul eternally.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:50.880]   Boldly I approach your throne.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:00.840]   Blameless now I'm running home.

[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.720]   More beauty than this world has known.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.700]   I'm face to face with love himself,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.700]   his perfect, spotless righteousness.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   Oh, a thousand years, a thousand turns
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.200]   are not enough to sing his praise.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.680]   They're not enough.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.180]   Boldly I approach your throne.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.160]   Blameless now I'm running home.

[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.100]   By your blood I come, welcomed as your own
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.600]   into the arms of majesty.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:10.580]   Running into your arms.

[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.480]   Now when we're free from condemnation.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:44.380]   Oh, praise the one, praise the one who
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.360]   made an end to all my sin.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.840]   This is the art of celebration.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.300]   Now when we're free from condemnation.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:12.120]   Oh, praise the one, praise the one who
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.620]   made an end to all my sin.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.620]   There is no condemnation of you.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.620]   We are waiting for your throne.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.600]   Boldly I approach your throne.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.580]   Blameless now I'm running home.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:43.080]   By your blood I come, welcomed as your own
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.580]   into the arms of majesty.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.060]   Majesty.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:09:09.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:18.020]   One day when heaven is filled with his praise.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:25.980]   All right.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.480]   Good morning.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.020]   Bering Community Church online and guests
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.000]   who have joined us this morning for our worship.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.700]   We have actually quite a few announcements
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.000]   to get to as things are changing rapidly.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.500]   And I'm sure you've been reading up or seeing things online.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.000]   And we're going to give some announcements.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.500]   But before we do that, we have the most important part
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.500]   of the day.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.000]   We want to give a shout out to Nao,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   that you're doing a great job in helping the parents
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.500]   and worshiping together.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.020]   And we have one birthday this week.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.020]   Kara Young is turning eight.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   So happy birthday to you.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.520]   All right.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.020]   Let me get to a few announcements
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.020]   before we get started.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   First of all, the Ephesians Bible study.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.020]   We're taking, again, a short break this week.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.520]   And then it'll be back on the following week
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.020]   to finish up the second session of that.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.520]   Typically, we have summer off during this period.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   And we pick it back up at the end of August.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   But considering we're all online and this
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   may be the only connection that we have,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.040]   and so we decided to keep this going at least
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.540]   and shorten it a little bit.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.540]   And we're going to be going, again,
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.540]   I think it's till the end of July or early August.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.040]   And then we'll be taking a break at that time
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.540]   before we get into another text.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.040]   So again, we have a one-week break this week.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   And then after that, we'll pick right back up
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.540]   and finish the study of the book of Ephesians.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.040]   And if there's anybody out there who
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.540]   have been waiting to jump into the Bible study
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.540]   and because we're not taking a break, we're going,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.540]   you still want to do that, you can email Pastor Mark
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.040]   and he'll try to help you with that
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   and try to get you plugged in somewhere.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   Another announcement is with our Indian pastor support.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.540]   We were waiting until we got back together
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.540]   to make the announcement, but again,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.540]   the annual or monthly support that people
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.540]   are committed to for a year is going to be up in June.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.540]   And so we're asking that if you are able to,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.040]   to sign up again for one more year from June to June next year.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   And especially now, our Indian pastors
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.540]   are in great need of our support.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.540]   You may have been reading that India has been on lockdown
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.540]   and especially the poor people in the villages
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.040]   have not had access to be able to go to work
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.540]   or go to the markets.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.040]   And so the government has been sending out support,
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.540]   not financially, but through food.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.540]   And the local government, many of the local governments
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.040]   who are controlled by the radical Hindus
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   are preventing the Christians from getting access to that.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   And so a lot of Christians are suffering,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.540]   not only because of the pandemic,
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.540]   but they're not able to eat.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.540]   And so we want to be able to support them,
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.040]   our pastors and the local churches that they're supporting.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.540]   And so if you're able to do so,
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.040]   we ask you to, again, recommit for the next year.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   And so please let Pastor Mark know,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   and then he'll give you more instructions on that.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   So email him, and then we'll sign you up
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.540]   for the next year as well.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.540]   Again, so if you've been doing so,
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.040]   we encourage you to continue to do so.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   And if you haven't, this would be a good time
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.540]   for you to jump in for the next year.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.540]   And it'll be about $50 per pastor and their family.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.540]   So if you're able to do that, please let us know.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.040]   And final and important announcement,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.540]   I know that you guys have all been waiting.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.540]   Again, the information that we're getting
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.540]   from the government, from the local government,
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.540]   from the health departments,
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.040]   again, has been changing literally day to day.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.540]   We would hear an announcement one day,
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.540]   and then at the latter part of the day,
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.040]   it would be different.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.540]   We hear one thing from the federal government,
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.040]   another thing from the state government,
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.040]   another thing from the local government.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   And so we're trying to monitor that
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.040]   and do our best to submit to the authorities
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   that we're under without compromising
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   our convictions as Christians.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.540]   And there are, I've read and I've heard
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.040]   that up to about 3,000 churches or more
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   in California who have scheduled to open their church
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   on the 31st, which would be next Sunday.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   We will not be opening up officially on the 31st.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.040]   We are hoping to open up on June 7th.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.040]   And the likelihood that we will open up
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   on June 7th is pretty high.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   And so Governor Gavin said that he is going
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   to make a big announcement tomorrow about churches,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.040]   and the likelihood is that he's going to open it up
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   sooner than later.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   And so we're hoping that we'll be able to do that
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   under the permission of the state.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   So please keep that in mind.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   And so we're trying to get the church ready
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040]   as much as possible.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   We have the chairs distanced.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.040]   We have all the sanitation.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   We're asking everybody who comes to wear their masks.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   We're going to be having thermal scanners.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   We're going to have certain parts of the church shut down.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   And so we're going as thorough as we can
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   so that people who are able to show up
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   will have peace of mind.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.040]   And so, again, so that's another reason why we're waiting
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   another week so that once the announcement is made,
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.040]   we can speed that up and make sure that we're ready
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   and not to hurry the opening up when we're not ready.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   And so watch out for some more specific announcements
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   of what to prepare for when you do come to church,
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   how to stand in line, what we expect,
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   which doors to use, which doors to use to go out.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   And so we are in the works of making a video
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   so that you can watch that, and before you come,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   at least you'll know what to expect.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   As we mentioned, as of now, we have all three services,
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   830, 1030, and 1230 services are at least on paper full.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   We're asking if you signed up for one of those services
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.040]   and you are not planning to come out immediately,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   we ask that you would let us know
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   because we can't reserve those seats
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   because we have people who are waiting.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   And so before we even consider opening up another service,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   we want to make sure that all three services are full
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   and the people who signed up are planning to come.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   And so if you are planning to come on June 7th,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   starting from June 7th and consistently come,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   then again, please keep your name on the roster.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   But if that's not the case, you have your name signed up,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   but you're thinking maybe sometime down the line
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   that when you feel more comfortable,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   you might come at that time.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.040]   If that's your case, please let us know ahead of time
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   because we have some people that we need to make room for.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.040]   And so again, all of these things are fluid,
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.040]   and it may change, but as of now, that's our focus,
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   and hopefully by June 7th,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   we'll be able to see many of you back at church.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   Okay?
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   All right, let's pray, and we'll start our worship.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for sustaining us,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   especially through these rough times, Lord God,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   in the last couple of months.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   We know, Father, that you are completely sovereign,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   that whatever good or difficult things, Lord God,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   that we see now or have experienced,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   we know, Father, that your love covers all of it.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   We pray for much wisdom, Lord God,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   as not just our church but many,
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   thousands of churches, Lord God,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   especially in California,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   are planning and preparing to open up.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   I pray for much wisdom that we would not open in flesh,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   that we would not live in fear,
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   that our foundation would be firmly planted
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   in Christ and his promises.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   Help us, Lord God, not to be irresponsible.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   Help us, Lord God, to be wise, Lord God,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.040]   and careful in all that we do,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   and that not only would we be worshipping you
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   in clear conscience,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   but that we would do our best to be a good witness
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   in the generation that you put us in.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   And so we ask for your blessing over this time,
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   and as we give our offering,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   may it be given to you in the abundance of joy in our hearts,
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   and may it be multiplied for your use, Lord God,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   in your kingdom.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   [music]
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   Good morning, church family.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   And what a privilege it is for us to gather again this morning
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   to worship our God.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   If you're able, would you please stand with us as we worship?
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   [music]
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   As we gather, may your spirit work within us.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   As we gather, may we glorify your name.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   we'll be blessed because we came.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   We'll be blessed because we came.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   As we gather, may your spirit work within us.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   As we gather, may we glorify your name.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   we'll be blessed because we came.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   We'll be blessed because we came.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   Steadfast love.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   Steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   They are new every morning.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   New every morning.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   Great is your faithfulness, O Lord.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   Great is thy faithfulness.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   They are new every morning.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   New every morning.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:19.040]   Great is thy faithfulness.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   [music]
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   [music]
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   What can wash away my sin?
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   What can make me whole again?
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   Oh, precious is the flow
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   that makes me white as snow.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   No other fount I know.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   [music]
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   For my part.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   For my part in this I see.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   For my friends in this my plea.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   Oh, precious is the flow
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   that makes me white as snow.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.040]   No other fount I know.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   [music]
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   Nothing came for sin atone.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   Not a bit that I have done.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.040]   Oh, precious is the flow
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   that makes me white as snow.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   No other fount I know.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   [music]
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   This is all my hope and peace.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   This is all my righteousness.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   Oh, precious is the flow
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   that makes me white as snow.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   No other fount I know.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Oh, precious is the flow
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   that makes me white as snow.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   No other fount I know.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   [music]

[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   [music]
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   All right, good morning.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   We're finally jumping back into Hebrews chapter 7.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   I'm encouraged to see how many of you are excited to get back into Hebrews,
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   especially the study of Melchizedek.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   Hopefully your enthusiasm will be the same after we study it,
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   because it is something that really requires your commitment to work toward understanding.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   But it is also really rich in knowing that God had prepared this deep into the Scripture.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   I think, personally, when I study about Melchizedek and what he means in the redemptive history,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   you can see God's intricate work that's going on behind the scenes that sometimes we don't see,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.040]   and that all of this leads to a greater confidence in who Christ is.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   So let me read the passage that we're going to be covering.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   We're going to be in chapter 7 for at least two to three weeks,
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   but let me read you the first part of it in verses 1 through 10 before we get in.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   "For this, Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God,
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   And those indeed of the sons of Levi who received the priest's office have commandment in the law
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren,
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   although these are descended from Abraham.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   and blessed the one who had the promises.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   But without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   In this case, more men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   And so to speak, through Abraham, even Levi, who received his tithes, paid tithes,
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him."
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   Let's pray.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   We pray that the study of Hebrews, and specifically the priesthood of Melchizedek,
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   would open our eyes to see your intricate hands of your sovereignty
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   and how you work together all things according to your good purpose.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   So help us, Lord God, to have eyes to see, ears to hear,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   and a heart that can be molded, Lord God, as you desire.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   All right, so again, we're living in really crazy times,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   and I'm sure some of you have been following the news carefully.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   I've literally been watching probably about an hour or more of different information
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   that comes out every day, seeing what kind of judgments we're going to make,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   what is the government saying, what are the numbers, what's going on around the world.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   And so all of this, obviously, is so that we can have a better grasp of what to expect going forward.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.040]   But right now the information coming out is so all over the place.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   I mean, you have the extremes of, "If we come out, we're going to die,"
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   to, "All of this is a hoax, is a fake, this doesn't exist."
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   I mean, it's all over the place.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   And some will say, "Well, science says this," and the other side will also say, "Science says this,"
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   and they have their own doctors and own professionals, own experts, that will back up whatever they say.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   And so it's very difficult to discern where do we put our confidence.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   And I'm sure we all have our different opinions about all of that.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   But from the very get-go, for Christians, our confidence should have never really been with all of those things.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   Because whatever it is that we study, wherever we put our confidence,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   if we put our absolute confidence in anything outside of Christ,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   eventually it will be exposed for what it is.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   Even with the best of intentions, mankind does not have the ability to have the truth and be consistent all the time.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   And so, you know, the reason why I say all of this is because all of this is really connected to what
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   the author of Hebrews has been saying about Jesus all the way up to now, and he will continue to say this.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   If you are anchored in anything outside of Christ, you will already have seen your heart drifted.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   And I think, you know, one of the things that this exposed, this pandemic exposed, is if your heart was already somewhere else,
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   in the last two to two and a half months, my guess is many people have already drifted in their faith.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.040]   Because whatever they were anchored in, it wasn't Christ.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   As soon as they weren't able to gather, as soon as there wasn't people or fellowship, they began to drift.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   And so as we make our way back into Melchizedek, I want to make sure that we understand why we're studying this to begin with.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   Our main point is not so that we can be better theologians and say, you know, Melchizedek,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   Archer taught about Melchizedek, and I know who he is, and you know, you may be able to know more than 99% of other Christians who this guy is.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   That is not our point. If you have all that knowledge and it doesn't transform your heart, your life, your hope,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   then you've really missed the whole point. In fact, it probably does more harm than good to know a lot of theology,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   and your head gets bigger, but your life doesn't reflect that.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   Well, the study of Melchizedek. We're in chapter 7, and he's going to be the main character,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.040]   and who he is, his priesthood, all the way to chapter 10. And so we're going to be on this subject.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   His name may not be specifically mentioned each week, but again, his priesthood and who he is,
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   is going to be the central subject from chapter 7 to 10. In fact, we can say the meat of the book of Hebrews
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   is between chapter 7 and 10. That everything that's been happening up to this point is really to set up for chapter 7, 8, 9, and 10.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   Because the argument was, starting from chapter 1, that Jesus is greater than the angels.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   He's greater than the prophets. He's greater than Moses. He's greater than Aaron.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   And so all of this to say, to pay attention to Christ. That was his main point.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   But the heart of the matter really comes to his priesthood.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   Because the natural tendency for a Jew was to drift back into his old way of life.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   And say, well, Jesus may be a great man, and he fed thousands, and performed miracles, and maybe he's a great man.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   But to a Jew, the temple, the sacrificial system, was his life.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   So he may be a great man, but what does that have to do with my life and my relationship with God?
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   Well, that's the point that he's trying to get at in chapter 7, 8, and 9, and 10.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   But, again, I'm going to read some verses with you before we jump into the three-point that I have this morning.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   Melchizedek is not first mentioned in chapter 7.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   So I hope some of you who are excited about studying chapter 7 may remember that Melchizedek actually was introduced to us in chapter 5.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   He actually is introduced...actually, let me read that to you.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   In Hebrews 5, 9-14, "And having been made perfect," talking about Christ,
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   "he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation, being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   So he actually introduces Melchizedek, right?
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   That Christ is our high priest according to Melchizedek.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   But then in verse 11 he says, "Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God,
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.040]   and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant,
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   and solid food is for the mature who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil."
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   So even before he gets to chapter 7, he kind of has to pause.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   And I'm pretty sure if you've been at our church for any period of time,
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   any time that I think I'm going to lose you, you probably kind of remember me saying,
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.040]   "Hey, you need to pay attention to this," or, "If you're going to stay awake for any part of the message,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.040]   this is the part of the message that you need to pay attention to."
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   I say all of that because I know it requires soberness to understand and engage.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   And if you just kind of casually listen, there are certain things that may go over your head,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.040]   and it's not going to make much sense.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   Well, that's what the author is really doing here.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   He's going to get into the details of Melchizedek.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   There are some parts of what he says about Melchizedek that if you sit there casually listening,
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   like, you know, I could talk about the love of God and grace of God,
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   and all these things are central issues of Christianity,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   but you probably heard those messages so many times that you can kind of casually listen
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   and still get a lot out of it.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   Well, Melchizedek, because most people don't know who he is,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   most people don't understand who he is,
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   and most people don't know the significance of who he is and how he's connected to Christ and his priesthood.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   So there's a lot of things that the author is going to say that if you don't pay attention,
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   if you don't commit to pay attention, if you go to sleep at 4 and wake up at 7,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   it's probably going to go over your head.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   So he takes a break, and after he says that,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   "I can't tell you if you're not paying attention and if you're not committed to this, if you're immature,"
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   and then he gets to chapter 6 with a stark warning that if you've been in the church
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.040]   and you've tasted the goodness of God and you had all the blessing, all the teaching,
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   all the benefits of being in the church, and yet all of it goes over your head
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   and you're still drifting back into your old way of life, he says there's no hope for you.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.040]   So in other words, all of chapter 6 is to get them to pay attention.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.040]   Here comes the meat. That's what he was trying to do, right?
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   Here comes the meat. I want to tell you about Melchizedek,
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   but you really need to commit to this and pay attention.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   There's consequences if you just remain as infants.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   And then he wraps it up at the end of chapter 6 before we get into chapter 7,
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.040]   starting from verse 17. This is what he says.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.040]   "In the same way, God desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.040]   the unchangeableness of his purpose interposed with an oath,
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us."
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.040]   So again, pay attention to that. The whole reason why he gets into Melchizedek
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   is to make sure that the hope that we have in Christ is secure.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   Are you anchored in Christ? That's the question.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   We're not talking about a piece of paper. We're not talking about the church that you attend.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   We're not talking about the confession of the friends around you.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   We're not talking about your upbringing.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:28.040]   Are you firmly anchored in Christ? And what I'm about to tell you
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   is so that you can examine to make sure that you are anchored in Christ.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   Okay, in verse 19, "This hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   a hope both sure and steadfast, and one which enters within the veil,
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.040]   where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.040]   So I hope you notice that he ends chapter 5 introducing Melchizedek,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.040]   giving a stark warning to pay attention, and then he goes back at the end of chapter 6
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.040]   saying, "I'm going to talk about Melchizedek now. Stay with me."
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Okay? Melchizedek is an obscure figure.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   My guess is some of you who are listening to this sermon right now
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   may never have even heard of his name because he is only mentioned
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   in a few verses in Genesis chapter 14 and again in the book of Psalm one time.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   So in totality, he's mentioned his name maybe about two or three times.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:38.040]   And yet, three, four, five chapters are dedicated
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   in that what a huge role he plays in redemptive history.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   I mean, it is a huge part he plays.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.040]   And that's why, again, so many chapters are dedicated,
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   and why he spends a whole chapter telling them to watch out and pay attention
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   even before he gets in.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   So just to kind of give you a broad outline since we're jumping back in,
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   chapter 7 is about the superiority of the priesthood of Melchizedek.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   Okay? So that's what we're going to be talking about today in a few more weeks.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   Chapter 8, "Therefore, because of the superior priesthood,
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   the superior priesthood introduces a superior covenant."
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.040]   That's chapter 8.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   And in order to have the superior covenant, there needs to be a superior sanctuary,
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   meaning that the old system, the whole system of approaching God
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   has been replaced by a whole new system of priesthood, covenant, and the sanctuary.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.040]   And then ultimately, all of this points back to Christ and his ultimate sacrifice.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   So chapter 10 is about the superiority of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   So that's a broad outline that we're going to be covering.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.040]   Chapter 7, "Superiority or ority of the priesthood."
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   Chapter 8, "Superiority of the covenant."
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   "Superiority of the sanctuary," chapter 9.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   And "Superiority of the sacrifice" in chapter 10.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   All right, so all of that is an introduction.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   So if you fall asleep now, it's completely your fault.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   I've done everything I could.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.040]   All right, so we'll see.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:19.040]   The main point today is the superiority of Melchizedek over Abraham.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   "Superiority of Melchizedek over Abraham."
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.040]   And so I have three parts to that.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   And so, again, if you are following the outline, you can see.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   Hebrews 7, verse 1, "For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.040]   who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him."
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   So let me stop right there.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   In order for us to fully appreciate what he says here about Melchizedek being superior to Abraham,
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   we really have to have a good idea of who Abraham is.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   Because without that, again, you might have some loose understanding of who Abraham is.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   And without a deeper understanding of who Abraham is,
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   you wouldn't hear like the first century Jews that he's talking to.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   Abraham was the father of their nation.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   In fact, let me go back early on where Abraham is introduced to us in Genesis 11.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   But, again, the promise that God makes to Abraham,
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   which is a covenant that he makes with Abraham to his descendants and ultimately to the rest of the world,
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   and this is what he says, "I will make you a great nation."
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   Talking about Abraham and his descendants.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   "And I will bless you and make your name great.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   And so you shall be a blessing, and I will bless those who bless you.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   And the one who curses you I will curse.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed."
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   So let me stop right there.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:57.040]   According to the scripture, Abraham is not simply the father of Israel.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   Abraham is the source of blessing for mankind.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   So if you hear Abraham as, "Well, God started Israel through Abraham,"
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   it wouldn't really make the kind of impact, what he's saying.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   Melchizedek is greater than Abraham.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.040]   Then it should.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   Because according to God's promise, all the other nations outside of the blessing of God
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.040]   can have a great nation,
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.040]   but yet the God of the universe who created all things isn't blessing them.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:34.040]   So the real blessing that only God can give is going to come through Abraham.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:42.040]   The rest of Israel's history, the rest of the Old Testament, is the fulfillment of this promise.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   Every part of what you study in the Old Testament from a Jewish perspective
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   is the fulfillment of this promise.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   God is going to—how is he fulfilling this?
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   How is he multiplying them?
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   How is he making him great?
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.040]   How are the other nations being blessed by this?
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:05.040]   So the origin of their faith begins with Abraham.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   In fact, God calls Abraham, and Abraham and his family obeys,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   and they set out on this journey that God calls them to.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   In a short period of time, they become so wealthy,
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   according to Genesis 13, 5, and 6,
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.040]   that his nephew and Abraham actually have to split.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   So within one chapter, they've accumulated enough wealth
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   where they couldn't even share the same space.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   This is not like New York, where you've got limited apartment space,
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.040]   and then you accumulate certain things.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.040]   We're talking about an open field.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.040]   We're talking about just acres and acres of land.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   That's how wealthy Abraham became.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   And so again, the fulfillment of Genesis 12, 1, 2, and 3
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   that we see right away in Chapter 13,
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.040]   that they become so rich, and they can't even stay together, so they split.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.040]   So Abraham stays in the Canaanite land,
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   and Lot chooses to take his goods,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.040]   and he goes where we know later on Sodom and Gomorrah,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   they come out, and so he settles over there, simply because of space.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   Well, where Melchizedek comes in is in Chapter 14.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   In Chapter 14, Abraham and Lot,
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.040]   they're just enjoying their life, and they're enjoying the blessing of God,
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.040]   but the kings of the Canaanites, four separate kings, they unite,
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   and they go into battle with the kings near Sodom and Gomorrah,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.040]   about five of them.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   So those four kings attack them, and Lot happens to be on the losing side.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.040]   Not that he was in the battle, he just happened to be in the land.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   And so the four kings of the Canaanites come and conquer them,
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   and they take all their possessions, and they're on their way back.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:56.040]   Abraham hears about this, as his nephew has been caught up in this,
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   and now he's lost all of his possessions.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.040]   So Abraham gathers his people.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.040]   Now again, Abraham is not a nation yet.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   He's just a very wealthy man.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:14.040]   But again, it's very important that you understand what's going on historically.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   He's going after four kings, four kingdoms,
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   who just defeated five other kings.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   And he had enough fighting men to take with him,
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   and he actually beats them.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.040]   You understand that?
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   Again, you have to understand the historical context in which Melchizedek shows up.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   So when he says, "Melchizedek is greater than Abraham,"
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   that you understand the historical context.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.040]   Abraham has been tremendously blessed by God.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:54.040]   He's not even a nation yet, and yet he's able to conquer four kingdoms by himself.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   And after he regains possession of all that was lost,
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   and is coming back with his nephew,
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:11.040]   is when he comes and encounters Melchizedek, the king of Salem.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.040]   Again, all of this is a background,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.040]   because the point that he's trying to make is,
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.040]   Melchizedek is greater than Abraham.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   You know what that makes Abraham?
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   Greater than all the kings.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.040]   Greater than all these men. Greater than all the possessions.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.040]   So, whatever was happening during history at that time,
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.040]   Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   So imagine if you were a Jew hearing this, knowing the historical context,
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.040]   who is this Melchizedek?
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   That he shows up from nowhere.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   He shows up from nowhere, and Abraham bows to him.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   I mean, think about it humanly speaking.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.040]   Abraham has so much possession in chapter 13,
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   he can't even stay in the same place as Lot, they separate.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.040]   Lot gets captured by four other kings.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   Remember, these four kings conquered five other kings.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   Abraham has become strong enough in chapter 14 to even conquer them.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.040]   And then here's this guy, literally one or two verses,
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:23.040]   shows up and Abraham bows to him.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   So if you're reading that carefully,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.040]   if you're reading through Genesis carefully,
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.040]   you should have stopped and asked,
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   who is this guy?
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   Who is Melchizedek?
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   But that never gets explained.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   Other than way over in Psalm chapter 110, he says,
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   well the Messiah is going to come in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   So the only other thing that we know about Melchizedek
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   is that Abraham considered him greater than himself.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.040]   That's all we were taught in Genesis 14,
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.040]   that he is a king priest, received the tithe, disappears,
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   and then he says the Messiah is going to come in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   So if you've been studying the Old Testament,
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.040]   preparing and waiting for the Messiah,
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   and all of a sudden the author of Hebrews says,
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   you want some meat? Here's some meat.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:24.040]   You want to really understand what God has been doing in history, here it comes.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.040]   Jesus comes in the order of Melchizedek
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   to fulfill that prophecy in Psalm 110.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   But before I get into this meat, you need to pay attention.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.040]   If you've been a casual Christian,
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   and all you want to know is Jesus loves you and died for you,
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   and that's enough for you,
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.040]   and you're not curious enough to dig into his glory,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.040]   and you're not curious enough to ask deep questions,
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.040]   then it's going to go over your head.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.040]   And that was all a setup.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   Well, all of that, again, to give you the background understanding
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   of how a first-century Jew who knew the history would have heard,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.040]   Melchizedek is greater than Abraham.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:16.040]   Now, we're going to be on this subject for the next two, three weeks.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.040]   But for today, I'm going to give you three things that this passage says
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   what makes Melchizedek greater than Abraham.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   Number one, the one who collects tithes is greater than the one who gives it.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   It says in verse four,
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.040]   "Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   gave a tenth of the choice's spoils."
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.040]   "Observe how great this man," Melchizedek was,
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   "to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the choice's spoils."
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.040]   Now, let's understand what tithing is.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   The specific law of tithing did not come in
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.040]   until the Mosaic law in Leviticus chapter 27.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.040]   So those of you who are with us studying Leviticus chapter 27,
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   remember what he says there.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.040]   But tithing actually shows up way before that,
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   here in Genesis chapter 14, and probably before that,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   because there is no instruction given to Abraham.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   Abraham knew to give tithe even before any instructions are written down.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   So in other words, the sacrificial system outside of the Mosaic law existed.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   He shows up, and the meaning behind the tithe,
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.040]   whether it was pre-Mosaic law or post-Mosaic law,
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.040]   in Leviticus 27.30 says this,
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.040]   "Thus all the tithes of the land, of the seed of the land,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's, and it is holy to the Lord."
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:50.040]   Tithing was commanded to the nation of Israel as an act of lordship.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.040]   Giving a tenth of the best of the harvest was given to God
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.040]   to declare that all of this ultimately belongs to you.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   It was an act of lordship.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   It was a first sign that whatever, whether I was a millionaire,
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.040]   or whether I'm just making a few bucks,
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   that in His sovereign will, God gave me what He gave me,
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.040]   and I'm returning it to you.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   That's what tithing was in the Old Testament.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   Well, he says, Melchizedek shows up, and Abraham, if he was rich before,
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   now he's filthy rich, right?
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   Because he just beat four kings, and everything that they took became his.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   So you see this progression of God blessing him,
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.040]   and he's become this filthy rich man,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.040]   and he gives a tenth of that as an offering to Melchizedek.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:44.040]   And so he says, "The one who receives the tithes is greater than the one who gives it."
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   So immediately, Abraham recognizes him as greater.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:57.040]   Hebrews 7, 9, it says, "So to speak, through Abraham, even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes."
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   Again, I hope I didn't lose any of you, okay?
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:04.040]   I hope you're putting your thinking cap on and straining to understand.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   And if you don't understand, please ask, right?
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   Don't just kind of, you know, just kind of, "I don't understand."
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   It must not be important.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.040]   If I don't understand, it must not be important.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.040]   I think part of the reason why there's shallowness in Christianity
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.040]   is because there's shallowness in the interest in the things of God.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:29.040]   And so it's kind of like seeing, you know, seeing beautiful things from a far distance.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:34.040]   Those of you who ever traveled to maybe Seven Wonders, you know,
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   maybe, I don't know, like Dam for, you know, like you've gone to Machu Picchu, you know, the Great Wall.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.040]   Those are the only thing I can think of right now, right?
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.040]   It's not the same looking at pictures.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:49.040]   It's not the same hearing other people describe it.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   It's not the same, right, as when you are able to physically watch it.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:58.040]   Well, I think in the same way, many Christians are satisfied with the explanation
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.040]   that other Christians give about who Christ is.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   And that's enough, right?
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.040]   And the reason why many people's faith remains shallow
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   is because they're satisfied with just staying, keeping their distance and not really digging in.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:17.040]   Well, again, this is one of those things that the more we dig, the more of glory of God gets revealed.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.040]   And hope, my hope is that you will see that.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   The more we dig, the more you see just how deep this thing goes, right?
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:31.040]   So when he says, just by him giving the tithe, it can show, it shows
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   that Melchizedek is greater than this guy who just conquered all these kings.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.040]   So this was a source of pride for the Jews.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:45.040]   Remember when Jesus says to the Jews, he said,
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   "If you abide in my word, then you shall know the truth, and you will be my disciple,
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.040]   and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   And they get offended.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:56.040]   To set free? Well, you're not talking to slaves.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   You're comparing us to these bond servants, these indentured servants.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   We're not low class like that, right?
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.040]   We've never been slaves. How dare you call us that?
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.040]   And then he says in John 8, 33, they answered him,
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.040]   "We are Abraham's descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   How is it that you say you will become free?"
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   What is our confidence?
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.040]   What is your confidence?
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   You know, at the beginning of all this pandemic, right, and fear gripped the world.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.040]   We were seeing scenes of people dying on the street,
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   and we were hearing crazy numbers of over 2 million people going to get infected or even die.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   And so we thought at the beginning of all of this that every single one of us is going to know somebody personally,
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   that there's some people in our church who's going to get it, and they're going to die.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   And so fear gripped not only us, but the rest of the world.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   And that's why they did something really radical,
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.040]   shutting down the economy for this long, even with all the consequences.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:05.040]   Now that the information is coming out, and it is still serious,
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   but it wasn't anywhere close to what they were fearing in the beginning.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   And so slowly the economy is coming back, and slowly people are coming back to work,
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   and churches are starting to open up, and I know that there's still a lot of fear.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   But at what point?
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   How safe does it have to be for people to gather?
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.040]   How safe does it have to be?
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   Is it a 100% guarantee that no one is going to get sick?
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   100% that you're going to live a long life, you and your children, and die at a ripe old age?
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:41.040]   Where do we find our safety?
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.040]   Where are we anchored?
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   There are some things that we do as Christians that a lot of non-Christians wouldn't do
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.040]   because they do not have hope in Christ.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:59:04.040]   Living a long, safe, healthy life is the promise that the world gives, not Christ.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   Because we believe in Christ, because we are anchored in Christ,
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:15.040]   our decision-making is not purely made on safety.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   Our satisfaction, our hope, our foundation, our security is grounded in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   See, these Jews thought that they were safe because they were descendants of Abraham.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   We're not like these Gentiles. We're not like these pagans.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   We said, "No, there's something greater than Abraham."
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   Well, if there's somebody greater than Abraham, where does that put us?
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.040]   There's something outside of Israel greater than us, then where does it put us?
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   And all of a sudden, it completely abolishes their security.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   And that's exactly what it was meant to do.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   Whatever it is that you are anchored in, you're not safe.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   And that's why I said, "You're drifting back thinking that you're going to be safer if you go back to your old system."
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.040]   He says, "No, Christ brings in something greater than that."
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   So just by the tithe alone, you can see that Melchizedek is greater.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   But secondly, the one who blesses is greater than the one who is being blessed.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:22.040]   Verse 7, "But without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater."
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.040]   But without any dispute, you know what that means?
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:34.040]   Abraham met Melchizedek, and it seems like, at least according to Scripture, that he's never met him before.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.040]   But immediately he recognizes somebody greater than him.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.040]   Again, just so that we understand the context.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   If there was any period of time Abraham would have been an arrogant person, I think it would have been then.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   Because he just conquered four kings.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.040]   Who conquered other five kings?
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   He's got so much possession, he had to separate even before this happened.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.040]   So imagine how much wealth that Abraham has at chapter 14.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   Imagine how much power he has.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   But all of a sudden he sees this strange guy coming, Melchizedek, and he immediately submits himself under him.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   He says, "It was without dispute."
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   You know, like a lot of people play basketball, and maybe you're really good, and you're king of the court.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   And if you play, you know, you get to play in four, five, six games straight because you're the best guy on the court.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:39.040]   And all of a sudden Michael Jordan shows up, or Kobe, or LeBron, whoever you're a fan of, or Steph Curry.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   Okay, I'm going to cover everybody.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.040]   You can't open your mouth. There is no dispute.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:53.040]   Maybe in street ball and maybe at LA Fitness there's some competition, and maybe you might be a little bit better than them.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   But all of a sudden if one of those guys shows up, there is no disputing because no one would take you seriously.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   Even if you mentioned that, they would laugh at you.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   He says that Melchizedek's superiority was so obvious.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:15.040]   Now we don't know what he saw. We don't know if there was some glory upon him. We don't know.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   But as soon as he saw Melchizedek, he recognized God's presence upon him and his authority.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   And he said, "Without dispute."
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.040]   There was no jockeying. There was no questioning. There was no "Who are you? Why should I give you?"
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   There's none of that. As soon as he saw the Lord's anointing upon him, he, without dispute,
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   he gives him the tithe and he receives a blessing.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:48.040]   Now this blessing for Abraham's family is huge.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   Because remember, Abraham already had God's blessing upon him.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   Remember Genesis chapter 12? We said, "I will bless you and through you I will bless all the other nations."
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:03.040]   And because of God's blessing, they're getting filthy rich and then they're able to conquer other nations.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:11.040]   And yet, he saw the blessing of Melchizedek greater than him.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.040]   Without dispute.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:23.040]   And that should really cause us to take a step back and say, "There's something upon this guy."
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:29.040]   It was not like any other kings. It wasn't like he just happened to be a great king.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.040]   There was some anointing upon him that he recognized.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   And this blessing upon Israel, again, comes back again.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.040]   Remember the story of Jacob and Esau?
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:45.040]   Esau, Jacob is the slippery one. Esau is the hairy one.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   And whenever I read that story, I think, like, humanly speaking, I naturally gravitate toward Esau.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.040]   Because he's a manly guy. He's the guy who's hunting.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   And Jacob's the guy who's a mama's boy. He's home, you know, playing something with his mom.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:10.040]   And so Jacob is staying home and he's maneuvering to take his older brother's blessing away.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040]   Esau comes back famished.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   And he said, "Well, if you give me your birthright, your blessing, as a firstborn, I'll give you this bowl of soup."
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   Now Esau, you know, he's hungry.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.040]   So what does this blessing mean to me when I'm going to die?
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   And it's just kind of drama. He's over-exaggerating.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   Well, that little event, that little twist that Jacob carries out, causes the blessing to go through Jacob instead of Esau.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:52.040]   Later on, in Hebrews 12, verse 16, he warns us not to be like Esau, who sold his blessing and became immoral.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.040]   Immoral and ungodly because of that.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   When we look at that, it's like, wow, he lost his blessing from God because he got hungry.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.040]   And he couldn't say no to this thing.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.040]   Now you have to understand that this blessing, this firstborn blessing upon Esau,
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   was not an ordinary blessing of any other family.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.040]   This was an anointed family.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   When he rejected the blessing, he wasn't just rejecting the inheritance of his forefathers.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.040]   He was rejecting God's blessing, God's promise that he made upon this family.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   And so when he rejected, he was literally saying, "You know, what good is God to me?
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:43.040]   What good is all the promises that God made to me, to my fathers and my grandfather, if I can't eat?"
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:51.040]   And that's why he was called immoral and godless, because he rejected God for a bowl of soup.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:59.040]   What is my point? The point is to receive Abraham, who had this anointing from God,
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:07.040]   to meet Melchizedek and to say, "Your blessing. I need you. Your blessing."
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   It says a lot about what Abraham recognized.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.040]   The one who was being blessed is less than the one who is blessing.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:26.040]   You know what this tells us is, our greatest hindrance in our walk with God is pride.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.040]   It's our pride.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:36.040]   When we are not able to recognize, we're not able to recognize who God is,
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   and we refuse to submit ourselves to him.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:47.040]   That is our greatest hindrance to true worship and is the greatest hindrance to, ultimately, our life.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:52.040]   But when we're in the presence of God, there is no disputing.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.040]   When you go to heaven, you know, like even on earth, even in the church,
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:02.040]   there's always discussions about whose opinion is right, whose is wrong.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.040]   Right now, you have the whole country, whole world divided as to who's right and who's wrong.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   I don't think we're going to know for years, to be honest, like which information is right, which is wrong.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:17.040]   And everybody is absolutely convinced, "My party is right. My information is right.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.040]   My facts, the doctors that I rely on, we're all right."
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.040]   And I don't think we're really going to know until years have passed and everything that we know.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.040]   And when we are separated from our emotions, our own opinions,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.040]   and we just purely look at the facts, what's going on today?
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.040]   That happens oftentimes even in the church. Who's right? Who's wrong?
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:45.040]   My education, my experience, my understanding, my giftedness over your giftedness.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.040]   And some, "No, mine better." No, you're better.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   But when you look at the scene in heaven, there is no disputing.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:08:01.040]   If you've ever seen the picture of what heaven looks like, angels, elders, holy creatures,
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   the multitudes, Jews and the Gentiles, are all bowed down at the throne of grace in eternal worship.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   There is no disputing.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.040]   When we're in the presence of God, it automatically causes us to be humble.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   I would think Abraham would have been a very difficult person to bring to his knees at that point.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   And yet as soon as he recognized God's anointing upon Melchizedek, he became humble.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.040]   He became humble.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   Even though it was just a blip in history, it was a shadow that if you've been paying attention,
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:47.040]   "Who is this guy? Why would Abraham submit himself to him?
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.040]   Why would Abraham, with God's blessing, receive blessing from him?"
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   So that when Christ came and he said, "Jesus comes in the order of Melchizedek,"
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040]   that's who he was.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   Now it makes sense why Abraham submitted himself to him.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   Now it makes sense why he gave tithe to him.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   Now it makes sense why Melchizedek did not dispute.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:20.040]   Third and finally, the one who serves perpetually is greater than the one who serves temporarily.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.040]   All the other priesthood that the Jews knew was temporary.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   In fact, they had a time limit as to how long they could serve.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:35.040]   In Hebrews 7-3 it says, "Melchizedek is without father, without mother, without genealogy,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   having neither beginning of days nor end of life."
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:45.040]   Some people have read this and thought, "This sounds like Jesus."
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.040]   And so there's been a lot of discussion as to, "Is this Jesus? Is this not Jesus?"
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:55.040]   Because so many of the descriptions that he gives about Melchizedek sounds like Jesus.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.040]   Well, clearly he is not Jesus, and I'm going to explain that a little bit later.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:06.040]   What he is saying is that Melchizedek doesn't come from the same line of the Levites.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   And when he says he's without genealogy, it means that his authority does not come from his birth.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.040]   Now, why does he say it this way?
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:24.040]   Because if you remember the Old Testament, the Old Testament is filled with genealogies, right?
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.040]   It's filled with genealogies, and sometimes we read these genealogies,
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.040]   "What is the purpose of these genealogies? I don't understand who these people are.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.040]   Why are there so many pages and chapters that talk about genealogy?
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.040]   Maybe if I was closer, maybe if that was my grandfather, that would make more sense."
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:47.040]   The reason why there's genealogy is because genealogy traces the authenticity of that person's position.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   Because God said that the seed of the woman is going to come, and he's going to crush the head of the serpent.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:59.040]   So he was constantly tracing the genealogy of how this Savior was going to come.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:07.040]   But they also traced the genealogy of the Levites, because only a Levite can participate in the temple work.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:14.040]   So when he says he is without father, without mother, without genealogy, means he is outside of that system.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:20.040]   That his authority doesn't come because his parents were Levites, or because his grandfather was blessed.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.040]   He is, in other words, above that.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   There is a separate system, separate priestly system, that is not submitted to human system.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.040]   Okay? So again, hopefully you're following me.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.040]   Remember when the disciples asked Jesus to pray, right?
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:45.040]   This is what Jesus said to pray. He said, "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   That's the beginning of the Lord's Prayer, right?
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   That his will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   Meaning, whatever God is doing, whatever system that God has,
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:13.040]   whatever order that exists in heaven, will eventually be reflected on earth.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.040]   You follow that?
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   The problem that we get into is, we want the earthly things to be reflected in heaven.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:29.040]   A lot of times, the way we even imagine what heaven will be like, is utopia on earth.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.040]   Whatever is the most beautiful thing that I can imagine on earth,
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.040]   that maybe that's what heaven is like.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:43.040]   The prayer and the activity of Christians is to recognize that even the most beautiful thing that you and I see on earth,
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.040]   is under God's curse.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.040]   Sin affected not only human beings, but it also affected animals.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   It also affected creation.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:01.040]   So everything that you and I see, all the systems that we see, have all been affected by sin.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   And it will all be done away with when Christ comes.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   So a Christian's prayer is to have his kingdom come, his will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:20.040]   Well, the reason why I say all of this is because the Melchizedek's priesthood is a heavenly priesthood.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.040]   That wasn't meant for a temporary system where Christ came and it's done away with.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:34.040]   That temporary system, ultimately, was to prepare for the eternal system that was coming under Melchizedek.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.040]   You get that?
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   Now I have no idea if you got it or not.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.040]   I'll see in the coming weeks.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.040]   When I see your face and I mention Melchizedek and you have a blank look,
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   I'll know if you paid attention or not, or if you got it or not.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   But again, this is that important.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   Melchizedek, his priesthood, comes from heaven.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.040]   It was preparing.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:07.040]   So I didn't mention this in the beginning, but I think it's important that I mention this.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:16.040]   Why does God use Melchizedek as a type, as an impression, to prepare for the coming of Christ?
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   Why doesn't He just say, "Melchizedek is a system made in heaven.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   This is who Melchizedek is.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.040]   He is not Jesus. Why does He not explain?
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.040]   Why does He just give us a picture of Him?"
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   And then we find the reflection of that in Christ and then tells us a detail in Christ.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.040]   Because first of all, it wasn't about Melchizedek.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.040]   Melchizedek was only to prepare.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.040]   The meat was in Christ.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.040]   It was only to prepare for Christ to come.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:51.040]   Hebrews 1, verse 1, it says, "God spoke in many ways in the Old Testament, through many avenues, in order to prepare."
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.040]   But now they speak, what?
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   God speaks through His Son.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   That's how the book of Hebrews starts.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   So in other words, everything that you knew about the Gospel has been spoken through poetry,
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:16.040]   through illustrations, through proverbs, through narratives, and through various kinds of types and pictures.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.040]   But now in the New Testament, the New Covenant, God speaks clearly through His Son,
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.040]   which is what we are experiencing now.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   Now why is it communicated that way?
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.040]   Again, let me go back to India.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.040]   India has the heaviest concentration, the largest concentration of illiteracy in the world.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:44.040]   In fact, they say that 39% of every illiterate person in the world is in India.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.040]   That's a large number of people who are illiterate.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   And the majority of these illiterate people are in villages who are poor because they don't get education.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   So you have young children as young as 3, 4, 5, even up to 10, 15, 16, 17-year-olds who have never gone to school.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   And we run into them all the time.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   We have several of our pastors who have no education.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   And so when we go there and try to teach the Bible, and we do expositional teaching, many of them cannot follow.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   So a lot of the mission work that is done in India are telling them how to tell stories
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   and how to share stories to other people.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:30.040]   So, and here's what's interesting, and this, hopefully this will kind of help you to understand why the Bible is told a certain way.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   In the time of Christ, an average Jewish community, what do you think their illiteracy rate is?
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   According to studies, literacy rate in an average Jewish community during the time of Christ
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:56.040]   was somewhere between 0 to 10%, depending on which village you lived in.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   In fact, most scholars believe it was much less than that. It's anywhere from 0 to 3 to 4%.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   That means over 90% of the people that Jesus was speaking to could not read or write.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   Over 90% of the people that the Bible was written for them to understand could not read or write.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.040]   So they were completely dependent upon coming to the temple.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.040]   And that's why the Bible says over and over again to commit yourself to what?
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:26.040]   Public reading of the scripture because they couldn't read it for themselves.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:31.040]   And that's why they were so susceptible to wolves coming in.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   Because they were completely dependent on them to tell them what the Word of God says.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:42.040]   And so God communicated these important things through poetry, through many different channels,
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:48.040]   through particular types, Melchizedek, so that when Christ came and they saw who he was,
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.040]   they could say, "I see the connection."
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   Even though the way we're studying it, we're expositing words and verses and paragraphs and syntax and grammar,
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.040]   the early church could not study it that way because they didn't know any of that.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:13.040]   So God left impressions. God left stories to make it clear that here's a clear connection of who he is.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   And he says that Melchizedek was made like the Son of God.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:25.040]   And this is why we believe that this is not Jesus because he said he was made, first of all, like the Son of God.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.040]   The Son of God was not made like Melchizedek. Melchizedek was made like the Son of God.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   In other words, Christ existed before him. Christ was there before him.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:45.040]   And so Melchizedek took a reflection of him and then now Christ comes to fulfill what God placed in history through Melchizedek.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.040]   And he remains perpetually, he says.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.040]   A Jewish priest could only serve between the age of 25 and 50.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.040]   So even if he had a long career, it would only have lasted 25 years, he says.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:00.040]   But Melchizedek is eternal.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.040]   And again, in Psalm 110.4, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind,
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:09.040]   'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.'"
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   Now, remember what I read at the end of chapter 6?
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   The reason why he talks about Melchizedek is for what purpose?
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:24.040]   So that our hope will be firmly grounded in the truth of Christ.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:30.040]   That wherever that we are anchored in, that is not Christ, is always going to shift.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:36.040]   That Christ, his priesthood, is not one time done and over with. It is perpetual.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   In other words, he is constantly interceding for us.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   Not only while we live, but even after we die.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   Even in eternity, he is a perpetual priest interceding on our behalf.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:57.040]   So our foundation, our hope, is not just during this lifetime.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.040]   It's not just while we're walking on earth.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:07.040]   At all times, perpetually, eternally, he stands before us and God.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   Always interceding on our behalf.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:17.040]   So therefore, because Christ has fulfilled that role,
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.040]   there is no longer any need for the Levites.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.040]   Which is really interesting because as soon as Christ came,
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.040]   remember what happened at AD 70?
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:35.040]   AD 70 is where the prophecy is fulfilled.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.040]   Remember when Jesus is coming into Jerusalem and he weeps over them?
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.040]   Because only if you knew today what would bring you peace,
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.040]   but because you did not recognize the coming of the king,
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.040]   that judgment is coming upon Jerusalem.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:52.040]   He was prophesying about the judgment coming on AD 70.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:57.040]   The Roman government got sick of the Jews and they came and completely obliterated the temple.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.040]   Every stone was just taken out and there's no remnant of the temple
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.040]   because the Romans completely obliterated it.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:08.040]   Now the reason why that's significant is one, it fulfilled Jesus' prophecy.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:13.040]   But two, they can never have the Levites.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:19.040]   Because all the genealogies was kept at the temple.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.040]   So if somebody comes and says, "You know what? I come from the line of the Levites,
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.040]   so let's set up the sacrificial system." They can't.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.040]   Because genealogy is gone. And they can never establish the king of Israel either.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.040]   Because he had to come from the line of Judah. There is no record of that.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:42.040]   And even if they were able to somehow find it, the temple is utterly destroyed.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.040]   They can't.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:48.040]   Why is this significant?
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.040]   Because Jesus fulfilled all of that.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   And they were no longer in need of it.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.040]   Just like John the Baptist came on the scene to prepare the coming of Christ,
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.040]   and as soon as his work was done, he was gone. He went to be with the Lord.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:07.040]   All the sacrificial system, the Levites, right? All of it.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.040]   Jesus completely fulfills it.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.040]   And now he stands before us in the heavenly sanctuary,
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:19.040]   in the new covenant, with a greater priesthood, with a greater sacrifice,
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.040]   interceding on our behalf for eternity.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:29.040]   Can you imagine? This was half of the sermon that I prepared for today.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   Until yesterday.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.040]   Until yesterday I had, actually three times longer than this,
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.040]   and I said, "There is no way I'm going to be able to go through all of this in one day."
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.040]   And even now, as I'm wrapping up, it's like, "I could have cut this in half."
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.040]   There's so much in here.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.040]   And I really want to encourage you.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.040]   First of all, if you're not in the Word, if you're not in the Word,
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   it doesn't matter how much counsel you get, and, "Oh, you know, church people are so encouraging to me.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.040]   You know, I really love our pastors, and I really love our community."
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.040]   It won't last. I guarantee you it won't last.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.040]   If you yourself are not in the Word regularly, and your anchoring is not Christ,
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.040]   it's on people and system, and so I strongly want to encourage you,
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.040]   if you're not in the Word, to get into the Word.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   But those of you who are in the Word,
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   and you're used to just kind of getting elementary understanding of the Word of God,
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:37.040]   and when it comes difficult, Leviticus, you know, like Revelation, Ezekiel,
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.040]   minor prophets, some of the things that are a little bit more difficult to understand,
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.040]   we kind of shy away from, and say, "Oh, that's for the pastors. That's for the people in the seminary."
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.040]   I really want to encourage you.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:57.040]   The gold, the gold is buried. It's not deeply buried, but it's buried.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.040]   God wants us to seek Him with all our heart.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:09.040]   He wants us to seek Him, and those whose hearts get enlightened, whose eyes become open,
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.040]   are the people who recognizes the treasure that is in Christ,
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   and so He goes out and sells everything so that makes sure He has it,
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.040]   and in comparison to what He has, all of the other things become rubbish.
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   Who does that happen to? For those who are continually pressing on, pushing forward,
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:34.040]   to take hold of that which He was taking hold of.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:42.040]   Melchizedek is one of those treasures that I believe that if you strain to really deeply understand,
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:52.040]   even this blip in history, even this thing that you may have never properly understood,
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:57.040]   like God was doing that behind the scene?
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:03.040]   God had all of that covered, even in this little tiny glimpse that He showed me,
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.040]   that all these roots are connected to that?
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.040]   And you'll see, the more you dig into the scripture,
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.040]   maybe you've been looking at the trees and you're looking at the fruits,
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   but you don't understand the depth of these roots because the real fruit is really underground.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:29.040]   And that's when you really see, man, this is the Holy Spirit. This is God.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.040]   No man could have done this.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.040]   And again, that's how it affects me when I study Melchizedek.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.040]   It reminds me that even the things that I have no understanding,
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:45.040]   that eventually when I do dig it up, when I do understand it, wow.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.040]   So I hope that that's where you are, or hopefully that's where you will be,
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.040]   so as we continue to study through the book of Hebrews, that it will impact you deeply,
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.040]   and that you would fall in love with the redemptive history and the Word of God afresh,
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.040]   as we continue to study together. Let's pray.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.040]   Gracious and loving Father, we pray, Father, that your Word,
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:15.040]   which is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword,
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.040]   that what you have intended it to do, that it would do in our own hearts.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   Lord, we are so easily amused by foolish things in this world,
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:32.040]   knowing, Father God, that so much treasure is in your Word.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.040]   Help us, Lord God, to fall in love, not just to be students, not just to memorize,
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.040]   but to fall deeply in love with your words, knowing that it is your words,
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.040]   your will, your purpose.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   So we pray, Father God, that as you strengthen our hearts, as you anchor us in Christ,
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:55.040]   that you would give us a clearer and clearer vision of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.040]   that our confidence would not come from the leaders of this world,
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.040]   or many statistics, anything that we see around us,
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.040]   but that we may be firmly anchored in Christ and Christ alone.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:33.040]   Before the throne of God above I have a strong and perfect plea
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:43.040]   A great high priest whose name is love Whoever lives and pleads for me
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:52.040]   My name is graven on his hands My name is written on his heart
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   I know that while in heaven he stands No tongue can bid me this depart
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   No tongue can bid me this depart
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:24.040]   Satan tempts me to despair And tells me I'm a hill to a pan
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:34.040]   Upward I look and see him there Who made an end to my sin
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:43.040]   Because the sinless Savior died My sinful soul is counted brave
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:53.040]   For God the just is satisfied To look on him in condemnation
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:58.040]   To look on him in condemnation
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:14.040]   [instrumental]
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:24.040]   Behold him where the rose divine Perfect spot in his righteousness
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:33.040]   The great unchangeable I am The King of glory and of grace
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   One with himself I cannot die My soul is purchased by his blood
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:52.040]   My life is lived with Christ on high With Christ my Savior and my God
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:57.040]   With Christ my Savior and my God
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:06.040]   One with himself I cannot die My soul is purchased by his blood
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:16.040]   My life is lived with Christ on high With Christ my Savior and my God
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:27.040]   With Christ my Savior and my God With Christ my Savior and my God
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:39.040]   [instrumental]
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.040]   For today's benediction I want to read from Psalm 121
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:48.040]   I will lift up my eyes to the mountains From where shall my help come?
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:52.040]   My help comes from the Lord Who made heaven and earth
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:59.040]   He will not allow your foot to slip He who keeps you will not slumber
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   Behold he who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.040]   The Lord is your keeper The Lord is your shade on your right hand
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.040]   The sun will not smite you by day Nor the moon by night
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:15.040]   The Lord will protect you from all evil He will keep your soul
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:19.040]   The Lord will guard your going out And your coming in
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.040]   From this time forth and forever Amen
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:35.040]   God sent his Son They called him Jesus
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:45.040]   He came to the love Heal and forgive
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:56.040]   He lived and died To buy my pardon
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:06.040]   An empty grave is there to prove My Savior lives
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   Because He lives I can face tomorrow
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:26.040]   Because He lives all fear is gone
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:36.040]   Because I know He holds the future
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:46.040]   And life is worth the living Just because He lives
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:33:06.040]   Oh praise Him Oh praise Him Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:28.040]   Let all things their Creator bless And worship Him in humbleness
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:40.040]   Oh praise Him Hallelujah Praise praise the Father praise the Son
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:34:02.040]   And praise the Spirit three in one Oh praise Him Oh praise Him Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.460]   (soft music)
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.880]   (soft music)
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.460]   (gentle music)
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.260]   (upbeat music)
