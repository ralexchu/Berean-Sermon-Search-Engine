[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> Good evening, everybody.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   At this time, please go ahead and make your way forward to take your seats.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And then if you're right at the edge of an aisle,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   please go ahead and just try to squeeze in towards the center.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   We're glad to be able to join together in time of corporate prayer and
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   extended worship.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And just as a heads up to you guys, as in previous Praise and Prayers,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   we really do want to give you guys unhindered times of just prayer.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We will be giving various topics of prayer, guidance, etc.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But please know that you can continue just to pray to lift up all of your needs,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   to request the Lord to meet all the various struggles, trials,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   and requests that you have.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Now, I want to highlight that, as in previous sessions,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   the front rows of the chairs have been removed so that if later when the prayer
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   time opens up, you want to come forward to kneel.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   There's just a band of carpet where you can kneel.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You can go before the Lord and pray in that way.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You're also welcome, if some of you guys prefer to stand, you're welcome to stand.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Go stand in the back, etc., to stand and pray as well.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Okay?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Would you at this time please join with me in a word of prayer as we begin our time?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Heavenly Father, we are absolutely indebted to you.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   For, God, you have been so compassionate and gracious to us.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Lord, your word has revealed that although we were as lost as could be,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   although, Father God, we, like everybody else, was going our own way,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   living according to our own lust, our own passions,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and in the absolute blindness of our flesh, that it's you who had mercy.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And then, Lord, to know that God, even though we are yet fallen and so lost,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   at your mercy, Lord God, you hear us when we pray to you,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   when we lift up to you our requests.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We're so grateful that you avail yourself to us.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I pray, Lord, that with the conviction that, God, our lives are not victorious
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   because of our grit or our own power, but rather because of the hand of God,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I ask that you would help us to pray fervently.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And, Lord God, as we join in our hearts to lift up corporate topics to you,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   to lift up the ministry of the church,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   we really ask, God, that you would grant to us your blessings.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   We also pray that as we join our hearts in worship,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   as we join our hearts in praise,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   let this truly, Father God, be an outflow of the faith that we have,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and, God, would you grow it even more.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Would you help us to deepen in our affection for you.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Would you help us, Lord God, to have a deeper sense of dedication
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and a growing conviction that everything you say is real
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   and all your promise is true.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   We thank you for this evening. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Let's all stand together for a time of praise.

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   - Amen, before we go into time of individual prayer,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I'd like to give an encouragement from scripture
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   to inspire us, to get our minds just united
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   in the right place.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And the song that we just sang,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   just declaring that our God is a God
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   who's capable of saving.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And regardless of circumstance, how long, et cetera,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   there is hope in the name of the Lord.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   We look at a famous psalm, Psalm 116.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Take your Bible and turn there.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   This is a psalm that perhaps for us
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   may not be so familiar as, let's say,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Psalm 23, Psalm 19, et cetera.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   But within the Jewish community,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   this psalm, along with chapters 13 through 18,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   are some of the most famous.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Why?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Because it's a part of a collection
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   called the Hillel, which means praise.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Ever since some 1,445 BC,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   the time of the exodus,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   at the time when God delivered but the mighty hand,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   the people who were in slavery,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   and we have the Passover,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   at the end of that incredible celebration,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   this psalm was always sung.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And therefore, if you could imagine
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   that not just in one generation,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   not just amongst a hundred years
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   or a couple hundred years,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   we're talking several thousand years
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   of history of singing this psalm,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   all to the praise of God,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   all giving thanks to him for his great deliverance.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And so, even more today than even back then,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   because, again, this was tied to the Passover,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   now, in modern day,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   these psalms are connected to national festivals.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   These psalms are connected to any time
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   there's a joyous occasion.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   If there is a Jewish People History Day,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   they sing this psalm.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   If there is a journey to the wall,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   they sing this psalm.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   They regularly sing this psalm
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   as a praise to God.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And the reason why I mention that, then,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   is I want us to meditate on this
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   as both a national significance,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   a psalm of incredible impact
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   for the people as a whole,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   but for every single family unit,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   because you know that the way
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   that this Passover meal was practiced
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   was in every single home.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So just imagine throughout the land,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   or even when people are dispersed,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   the family unit would gather together
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   underneath the leadership of the Father,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and they would sing praises to God.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   But then, when you take a look at this psalm,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   you will immediately see
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   that it's intensely private,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   meaning personal.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   So on multiple levels throughout history,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   this has been the joyous,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   celebratory, and grateful heart
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   of the people who have experienced
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   the deliverance of God.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And so we're going to walk through this passage
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   not by way of just hitting points, etc.,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   but as a walkthrough of meditation.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   So let me first go ahead and read.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And it says in Psalm 116,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   starting from verse 1,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   "I love the Lord,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   because he hears my voice
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   and my supplications.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Because he has inclined his ear to me,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   therefore I shall call upon him
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as long as I live.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   The cords of death encompassed me,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and the terrors of Sheol came upon me.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I found distress and sorrow.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Then I called upon the name of the Lord.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   O Lord, I beseech you,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   save my life.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yes?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Our God is compassionate.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   The Lord preserves the simple.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I was brought low, and he saved me.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Return to your rest, O my soul,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   For you have rescued my soul from death,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   my eyes from tears,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   my feet from stumbling."
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Let's take a moment to ask God to bless that reading.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Heavenly Father, as we now
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   meditate, Lord God,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   as so many saints did
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   through the generations and years,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I pray, Father God, that this would be
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   our both cry, our praise, our heart.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   This would be the tone, Lord God, of our inner soul.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   God, that we have a testimony,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   experiencing your incredible compassion,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   and therefore we're overflowing with praise.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Take time with me to imagine,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   as you think about these words,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   again, it's pretty incredible to think
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   that these instructions were given,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and so in every home,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   at the end of the Passover meal,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   this would be the song, again,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   resonating through each household
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   at the dinner table.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And what's more, I mentioned just a moment ago
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   that it's so intensely personal
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   that whether it's like a horde of people
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   gathered at a huge festival,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   whether it was in Jerusalem,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   if you recall, thinking back to Jesus' day,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I mean, there was like a million people in Jerusalem, right?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And when the Passover act come,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   yes, there were both the gatherings of people
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   at the temple, and they would sing the halal.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   When they would spread into their homes,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   and they would sing the halal, right?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And so in thinking through that,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   everyone in singing, but the first verse,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   the first words out of their mouth is,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I love you, Lord, you know?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   How profound, how appropriate.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And I wonder, and from the eyes of the Lord,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and to the ears of God, how pleasing.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   But the passage goes that I love the Lord
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   because he hears my voice, and the supplications,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   because he inclines his ear.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And we can't help but again go back
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   to the Exodus generation,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and to take a moment and to meditate.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   These individuals and their suffering,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   when they talk about cords of death,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   it is not just simply symbolic.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   When they talk about the terrors around,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   it's not metaphorical poetry.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   For 400 years, they were seeing their family members
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   get buried in monuments.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   They were seeing people in front of them get whipped.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   They themselves experienced the excruciating pains
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   of the evils of Pharaoh.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And in the midst of this, it was God who said,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I surely have seen the affliction of my people,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I have seen it, I have given heed to their cry,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and I am aware of their suffering.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It was because God had pity,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   it was because God had mercy,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and it's because God hears
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   that entire generations can be delivered.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Likewise, in a cross-reference where King David
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   is singing something really similar,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   almost parallel,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   is a passage in Psalm chapter 18, verses 1 through 2.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   In Psalm chapter 18, verses 1 through 2,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   King David says, "I love you, O Lord, my strength.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   "The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   "my God, my rock in whom I take refuge,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   "my shield and the horn of my salvation,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   "my stronghold.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   "I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised."
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And if you look at the subscript of this passage,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   this is in context when David says,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   "And all around me was nothing but my enemies,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   "because King Saul was so desperate, so zealous,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "so jealous over David,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "as he was willing to throw his spear,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "he was willing to lie and said,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   "'Oh, you're so precious, I'll never hurt you,'
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "and then he's throwing spears to kill him."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   You recall?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   King David had to run through forests,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   live in caves, hide, hide, hide.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Who is he gonna call out to?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And he says, "I'm gonna call out to God.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   "Who else am I gonna call out to?"
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And so for us, I pray that our hearts, too.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Yes, there are gonna be times when absolutely
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   there looks to be no one else who can help.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   There may be moments when we can experience
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   true helplessness.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   What power do the other brothers and sisters have around us,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   even in their best intentions and thoughts?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But the one whom we will call is our Lord.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And if we go back to our passage in 116,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   verse two, he says that I shall call upon him
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   as long as I live.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And that phrase, this idea of I'll call
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   in the name of the Lord, it's chalked through the Bible.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   What does it mean?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   It's that we're gonna accept that we're gonna continue.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   If he truly is the one who is able to help,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   who else am I gonna call?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I will continue seeking him.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'll continue calling his name.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I'll continue worshiping him.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And I'll continue in my dependency and trust.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   These are the individuals, this kind of heart
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   is the kind of individuals we wanna be.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Moving quickly to the next verses,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   in verse three and four, he describes
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   the cords of death has encompassed me.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   The kind of helpless state that he was in.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   As the terrors of Sheol came upon me
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and I found distress and sorrow.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Then I called upon the name of the Lord.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Oh, Lord, I beseech you, save my life.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Save my life.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   If we meditate on the kind of situations
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   that the Old Testament saints have been in,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   again, sometimes when you read the Bible
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and we talk about suffering and even for me
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   as I'm preparing a sermon and I say,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   hey, the scripture sympathizes with you.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Half of me wants to stop and say, ah.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But is our suffering, are we allowed to compare
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   the things that we've been through
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   versus the things that they've been through?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Again, we're talking about people
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   who have literally been whipped.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   We're talking about people who cried out, cried out
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and then in their despairing situations
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   they experienced even more suffering.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   We're talking about generational kind of suffering
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Are we allowed to make comparison?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And then you think about King David
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and you know not only in his young life
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   but even because both because of his own sins
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   but because of the wickedness of the people around him,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   he had experienced betrayal by his own family.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   His sons trying to take his life.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   People who he thought were his friends backstabbed him.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   He lost his own child.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   You name the kind of suffering that we may experience,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   he has experienced it to an nth degree.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   When he says, "Around me there is nothing but suffering,"
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   he really means it.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Are we allowed to compare?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Now, what I want to say to that is
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   definitely we dare not exaggerate our hardships.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   We dare not exaggerate our feelings of pain
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   to think that somehow ours match theirs.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   But yet at the same time, we know, praise be to God,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   that it's not the degree of our suffering that deserves his ear.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Amen?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   It is God's compassion.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It is God's grace.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And it's because he's a listening God,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   any amount of suffering from his children,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the Lord hears. Amen?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   It's not because of the severity.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   It's not because of the loudness of our voice.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   But should we truly and sincerely ask
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and come just like the psalmist says,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   "Lord, I beseech you."
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And even if it's a whimper and a small voice,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   "Lord, it hurts a lot for me."
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I dare not compare my suffering with other people,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   but perhaps it's too much for me.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   In this way, it does not matter.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   But what matters is that we would humble ourselves
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and give this kind of supplication to God.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Supplication just purely means asking and pleading for God's grace.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   A beautiful passage comes from 2 Chronicles 6, verse 21.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   2 Chronicles 6, verse 21.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   It says, "Listen to the supplications of your servant
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   and to your people, Israel, when they pray towards this place.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Hear from your dwelling place from heaven.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Hear and forgive."
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   What's beautiful for you and me
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   is that sometimes we absolutely take it for granted.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   But the Old Testament saints,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   because they did not have the open curtain, the open access,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   the full privilege to come with the kind of confidence,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   with the kind of a level of privilege
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   to come in the name of the Son,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   they would have to ask and beseech the Lord,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   "Would you please incline your ear to us?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Would you please listen?"
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Thanks be to Christ, for us, we know that in his name,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   the Lord has already said, "Yes, I hear."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And so finally, we ask the question,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   "What do we think happens when we ask?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   What do we think happens when we pray?"
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Verse 5, "Gracious is the Lord and righteous.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Yes, our God is compassionate.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   The Lord preserves the simple.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I was brought low, and he saved me.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Return to your rest, O my soul,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   For you have rescued my soul from death,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   my eyes from tears, my feet from strumbling.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Reflect on God's compassion,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   how he preserves even the lowly,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   how he preserves even the simple."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   You know that term "simple" is an interesting one
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   because the literal term, or the most frequently way
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   that that term is translated is "naive,"
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   people who believe whatever.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   I think there has been so many times
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   through the journey of the nation of Israel
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   when God was just so fed up and frustrated.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   "Why do you keep turning to these idols?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   They're nothing. It's just a piece of wood.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Why do you keep turning to these nations?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Why do you keep listening to them?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   How many times do you have to be duped?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   How many times do you have to be disappointed,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and those promises fail you?"
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And he says, "But it's the Lord who preserves and keeps you.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It's the Lord who rescues."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   There is a lot of self-talk in the Old Testament
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   whenever you read poetry,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   talking to your own heart, talking to your own soul.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And I love the fact that here,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   the talk to your own heart is one that says,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "Return to your rest."
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   There's almost a question to pose at your own heart
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and to the state of your own soul.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Do you want to stop being anxious?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Do you want to stop suffering through all these sorrows and fears?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Do you want to stop being swayed left and right,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   having so many ups and downs?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Do you want to stop being so moved,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   almost devastated every time something goes wrong in your life?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And the Scripture says,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   "To go to rest, turn to the Lord.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Know that God deals bountifully with you."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   I want to wrap up by saying,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   this beautiful psalm, I didn't want to necessarily present to you
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   as principle one, "This is what you must do,"
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   but rather just to meditate or inflect.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   This comes from the heart of people who have a testimony.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It's just simply in like the shortest way,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   "Hey, I've got a story for you.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   There were deep pains and deep hurts,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   but do you know what happened?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I cried out.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I went to the Lord and asked Him.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   I begged Him, and I said, "Please have mercy on me."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And the Lord, He rescued me from my tears.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   He rescued me from my hurts.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   He made sure that even if I started asking all these questions,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   "God, why am I so weak?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And what about the future?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Am I going to make the same mistakes again?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And is this going to happen to me?"
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   He settled all that.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Why?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Because it's the Lord who will keep me.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I pray for us that whether you've gathered here from maybe a state of hardship,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   maybe you've been drifting,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   maybe you've been kind of kicked off your horse, so to speak,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   please know that however you look into the future,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   you have to know this song.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   It's the Lord who will keep you.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Amen?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Heavenly Father, God, we're so thankful that You have given such words
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   to be recorded in Your Word to testify of how good and compassionate You are.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Help us to know this day that, God, You have been faithfully compassionate.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You have been so gracious to hear the prayers of Your saints for thousands of years.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And this psalm that we take a moment to reflect on,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   it's so beautiful because it's the same words by Your people across time,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   across space, and throughout the world.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Then I pray, Father God, that when we pray,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Lord, You tell us to pray with confidence, to approach Your throne with confidence.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And we recognize, Father God, it's not because our voice is strong.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's not because my pains deserve it.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   But, Lord, it's because You're that good.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I pray, Lord, that when we pray, it would be with such faith,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   with such trust in Your love.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   We thank You.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Amen.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   At this time, what we'd like to do is just give you an opportunity,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   for those of you guys who want to come up,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   please go ahead and come up now to Neil.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And what we'll do is give you guys time for the next 10 minutes.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   There isn't necessarily like a long list of topics or prompt
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   because this first section is just for you.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Whatever is on your heart, whatever you came in with,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   whatever personal needs you have for yourself,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   please go ahead and take time to pray now.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   So, again, if you'd like to move forward, go ahead and do that now.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   We'll play the background music for you guys,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   and then we'll come back for some more praise afterwards.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Thank you.

[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   >> Amen. We're going to continue on to pray, but in this next
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   segment, I want to ask you to please pray in intercession for
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.340]   the brothers and sisters around you. Let's really pray for
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:13.340]   people by name, the people that you're aware of, and by way of
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:17.340]   examples. Recently, there have been a lot of people who have
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.340]   unfortunately experienced, you know, loss, a great loss of
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:25.340]   people close to them passing. So, let's really pray that the
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:29.360]   Lord will be their comfort and more. Let's continue to pray for
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.360]   those who have ongoing physical needs. You know, we do have
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   people at our church who have experienced, whether it's just
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.360]   chronic pain, recent diagnosis, et cetera. And so, please
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.360]   lift them up. And then, as you know, there is a kind of pain
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.380]   that completely outside of the hands of physicians, et cetera,
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.380]   whether it's your parents who are in conflict, married
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:58.380]   individuals who should be in harmony in conflict, children in
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:02.380]   conflict with the parents. Sometimes this kind of
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:06.380]   relational conflict is more painful, as you know. So, let's
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:10.400]   pray, because sometimes we think, you know, if we should
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   just change the way we talk or change our words, et cetera. But
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.400]   actually, I believe the best kind of resolution, the sweetest
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   kind of reconciliation comes when the Spirit of God breaks
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.420]   you and someone's willing to yield by the power of Christ.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   Let's pray for that to happen, that the kind of conflict
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   resolution we experience at our church is thoroughly spiritual.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:38.420]   Amen? And then also, as you know, there's continual rising
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:42.420]   struggling with spiritual and cognitive mental health kind of
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:46.420]   issues. They wish they were stronger in the way that they
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.440]   think and their thought life, et cetera. Let's pray that the
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.440]   Lord will strengthen them in every way internally, that God
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.440]   will strengthen them in the inner man. So, again, please try
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   to think of names specifically and continue to pray. We'll give
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.440]   you guys another 10 minutes or so. Thank you.

[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.840]   we do trust and believe that you are sufficient for all,
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.840]   that God, you are not a God who is distant,
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.840]   but Lord, you are near.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.840]   And so for those who are grieving within our midst,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.840]   those in deep pain or suffering,
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   those individuals struggling
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   through circumstance, conflict, or more,
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   we pray, Lord, that as you are the God who provides
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.840]   and you know their needs before they're even spoken,
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   Lord, would you minister in your way.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.840]   Would you bless and give us your mercies.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.840]   As a final segment of our time in prayer,
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   would you please take this time to lift up the ministry here?
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   And there are so many things going on,
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.840]   but I'd like to, again, for you,
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   my guess is within your affinity
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840]   or the people you're involved with,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.840]   there's a lot of ministry going on.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.840]   Please continue to lift those up.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   But right now from the outreach team,
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.840]   as we had our meeting this past weekend,
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.840]   we're so grateful because there are constantly people
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   trying to minister to their family members.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.840]   And so please continue to pray for people by name.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.840]   There are also a lot of non-Christians
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.840]   who with great interest are coming out week to week.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.840]   There are individuals within the Bible study,
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.840]   here on Sundays, and sometimes at fellowship events.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   So please both keep your eyes open,
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.840]   but also let's be prayerful.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.840]   The India team just yesterday capped off a visit
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   to a city that had a lot of persecution,
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.840]   and so they were asking for prayer.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840]   And then today they're pretty much
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840]   on their flight back arriving tomorrow.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   So let's pray for the team that God would use everything,
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.840]   all the contacts, the VBS, et cetera,
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.840]   in that short time to His glory
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.840]   and for the furthering of His kingdom.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.840]   What's more, this coming weekend,
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   we have members meeting
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.840]   and also the induction of new members.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840]   Now in thinking about this,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840]   when we think about our church's ministry,
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.840]   you guys know how important the thought,
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.840]   just a simple thought, is that every member
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.840]   convicted by truth, in love with Christ,
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   and passionate for His glory
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.840]   is going to be to the health of our church.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.840]   And that's just our simple church motto.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   And so even the new members coming in,
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840]   we really pray that they would be loved upon
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.840]   and ministered to,
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.840]   but that they would grow in all of those facets
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   of their spiritual life,
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.840]   so that they would be a healthy contributing member
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.840]   here at Beroean.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.840]   What's more, there's a retreat,
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   especially for the single adults,
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   coming up really soon.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.840]   Pastor Ian Kwon is going to be preaching,
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.840]   motivating to run with a sense of purpose,
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   not beating aimlessly,
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.840]   but running to win.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840]   So let's pray for that.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   Shortly after, it'll be followed up
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840]   by our youth group retreat,
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.840]   where I'll be preaching from the book of James
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   on what it means to have living faith.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.840]   And then, for everybody,
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.840]   the whole church is going to be starting off
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.840]   our next Bible study
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   just in two short weeks.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   So those are, you know,
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   the small group times of discussion,
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.840]   the learning and the personal practice at home.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.840]   All of this is a huge portion
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.840]   of the official discipleship
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.840]   and teaching at church.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   Let's pray that God would make it fruitful to us.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.840]   Amen?
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   So again, please go into individual time of prayer.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.840]   We'll have another 10 minutes or so
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840]   of praying over those topics.

[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:32.080]   Father God, with our hearts joined, we do love you.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.080]   We love you because you've been so good to us,
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.080]   so generous, and God so kind.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:41.080]   Thank you, Lord, that you not only hear, but you deliver.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.080]   And thank you that as we've just sung now,
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.080]   God, we have hope in every situation.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:51.080]   Thank you, God, that through Christ we've overcome the world.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.080]   Thank you, God, that through Christ we have eternity.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.080]   Thank you, God, that in Christ we have everything.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.080]   And so, Lord, I pray that, yes, we may grieve.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.080]   Yes, we may go through hardships.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.080]   We may complain at times, but not like the world.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   For the world, this is all they have.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.080]   For us, God, we have all eternity.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.080]   We thank you. It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.080]   I appreciate you guys being here tonight.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   And just as a couple closing announcements.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.080]   This weekend is a busy Sunday.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:26.080]   There is going to be a fundraiser lunch for the Collegians.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.080]   That's just $10 for adults and $5 for children.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:34.080]   So please plan on having lunch after the second and third service.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.080]   And then please remember that 2 o'clock we have members meeting here.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.080]   And it will be game sharp at 2 o'clock because we have stuff in the afternoon as well.
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.080]   And lastly, if you're available to help us,
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.080]   we're going to need help just gathering the carpet
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.080]   and then bringing the chairs back in.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.080]   That would help us set up for Sunday.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.080]   Good night, everybody. Thank you.
