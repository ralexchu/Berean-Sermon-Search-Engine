[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   We're in Revelations chapter 17.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:30.520]   Let me pray for us and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.180]   Father we come before you asking for your guidance, asking for your Holy Spirit to continue
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.360]   to lead and guide us.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.660]   I pray that you would soften our hearts, that your word would mold our thoughts, our affections,
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.480]   that you would stir in us a hungering and thirsting for righteousness that can only
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   be satisfied in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.120]   Lord, you know how we wrestle, you know how we are easily distracted, you know the longings
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.840]   in our hearts.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.560]   We pray Father God that you would direct us to you, that even as we continue to study
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:23.080]   the book of Revelation, some of it Lord remains a mystery to us, but it is clear Lord God
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.640]   that you are sovereign and you are completely in control.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.800]   And I pray Father that through the study that you would move us more than just to satisfy
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.440]   our curiosity, but that a glimpse of Christ and his glory Lord would constantly point
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   us to you.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.120]   So we pray for your blessing over this time, in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.240]   So if you've, hopefully you've had some time to look at the text, chapter 17 and maybe
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.120]   even 18 before you came, but chapter 17 and 18 is probably one of the more difficult passages
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.480]   to interpret.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.320]   And not that the other parts have been easy, but if you've taken any time to look at it,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.600]   you know about the seven horns and then the ten, you know, seven kings, seven hills, the
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680]   ten horns and then you have the beast and then you have the riding of the beast and
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   then you have the waters and you have all this stuff.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.420]   And so it requires a little bit more time to dig into.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.960]   And again, everything that we studied up to this point, remember we talked about there's
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.360]   four different ways to approach the interpretation of book of Revelation.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.520]   So depending on which commentary you read, you'll have a completely different application,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760]   completely different understanding.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.000]   And I already kind of shared with you, you know, our approach to this.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.200]   But again, so there are some things that we want to take some time to look and chapter
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.040]   17, 18 really is meant to be together.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.560]   I think I shared that last week.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.080]   So I'm going to jump into it and it may cause us to ask some questions.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.880]   Again, we're not going to go in too deep, but hopefully you'll have a better understanding
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.840]   of it after we go through it.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.600]   So if you look at the picture, it's a lady riding on a beast with seven heads, but it's
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.320]   a dark picture so you might not be able to see it.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.200]   Okay.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.000]   Oops.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.440]   Alright.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.000]   So the beginning, chapter 17 and 18, it is not a description of God's judgment as the
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.760]   previous chapters.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   So the three different judgments that we've seen, we had the seal judgments, the trumpet
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   judgments, and then we had the final bowl judgments.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.880]   All three of them were descriptions of how judgment was going to come upon the world
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.600]   at the end times.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.360]   Chapter 17 and 18 is not a description of his judgment, but why?
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.200]   What has brought the judgment?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.480]   So it's a description of the rebellion of mankind, the work of the beast, specific descriptions
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.920]   of how at the end, how they're going to be united and to go against the lamb.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.560]   And as a result of that, how they're going to be conquered.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   So it's more of a description, chapter 17 and 18, of why the judgment is coming than
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.280]   the specifics of what we've been looking at up to this point.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   So again, it's what is being judged.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.560]   And these chapters describe satanic kingdom in the last days.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.680]   So we talked about it before, how the application of this is not necessarily all chronological.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.200]   There are certain parts of what is mentioned here is not talking just about the end times.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.960]   It's talking about the satanic kingdom in totality, the world in rebellion in totality.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   So there are parts of it where we're talking about just the very end, when Christ comes,
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.280]   the ultimate, the battle of Armageddon.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.040]   It's a description of that, but all the events that lead up to that is not necessarily just
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.600]   about the end times.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.840]   So just keep that in mind, that what we're reading here is not just talking about the
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.200]   very end, but the totality of satanic kingdom.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.440]   So we want to jump into two parts.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.960]   One is the identity of the great prostitute that is introduced to us in the very beginning.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.040]   And then the second part of it is the explanation of that that we see in verse six and on.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.240]   So it's going to be two major parts.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.600]   So who is this lady and what is she doing?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.760]   And then the explanation of that at the end.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.480]   Now, where else do we see a woman and the relationship with the beast?
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.400]   Anybody remember?
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.760]   Chapter 13, right?
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   Chapter 13, we saw again a woman and the woman has a child and the beast goes after the woman
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   and the child.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.640]   Remember that scene?
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.400]   Is this woman that woman?
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.340]   Clearly it is not the same woman, right?
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.760]   Why is that the same?
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.000]   I'm just trying to see if you read it or not.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.720]   It's clearly not the same because the woman of chapter 13, who do we say, who do we think
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   she is?
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.680]   Most likely Israel and her child is obviously Jesus.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.640]   So here, she clearly is not Israel.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.680]   So even though it's a woman and she has an intimate relationship with the beast, but
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.160]   it is not the same woman of Revelation chapter 13.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.620]   So who is she then?
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:31.120]   In verse 18, she's described as, or she's called the Babylon the great, mother of the
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.080]   prostitutes and earth abominations.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.880]   So clearly that's not Israel.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.400]   In verse 5, we've already studied in chapter 14, the meaning of Babylon.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.000]   The Babylon is used to symbolize a fallen world in rebellion against God.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.640]   So we see, we saw that in Revelation 14, 8.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   And then again, if there was any doubt in verse 18, it describes again, the city of
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   Babylon.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.800]   So obviously we know that the specific city of Babylon existed in history, but oftentimes
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.600]   when the Bible uses the term Babylon, it is referring to the whole world in rebellion
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.240]   against God, right?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   So here it's talking about the fallen world.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.960]   But if you remember when we were studying chapter 14, remember the different distinction
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.600]   between the Assyrians attack and the Babylonians, right?
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.320]   What were the Assyrians known for?
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.560]   Remember when we were studying the book of Isaiah, Assyria was going to conquer by how?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.480]   Intimidation and by force, right?
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.680]   They were known to be violent and very cruel.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.280]   So if you remember the book of Isaiah, it describes the Assyrians and how they're going
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.680]   to violently overthrow them and they're going to again, cause a great harm, physical
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480]   harm toward the nation of Israel.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.280]   And then the Babylonians come in and then the Babylonians conquering of Israel, perversion
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   of Israel, how are they going to do it?
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.120]   Through beauty and temptation.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.280]   And that's exactly what the Babylonians were known for, right?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.240]   The Babylonians were not known for brutality.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.800]   They were also a mighty nation that conquered many other nations.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.200]   But after they conquer them, they wanted to be Babylonians, right?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.760]   It's kind of like, kind of like, again, they're exact opposite.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.600]   You have one coming by intimidation and fear.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.740]   The other one's coming and conquering by assimilation, by temptation.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.480]   And that's exactly how this woman is described.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.400]   Her primary corruption and immorality isn't through intimidation.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.580]   It's through sexual temptation.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.720]   And that term, sexual immorality, is mentioned three or four separate times.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.640]   And then when we get to chapter 18, if you've read ahead, the whole theme of Babylon repeatedly
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.840]   over and over again is sexual immorality.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.000]   And we'll see that more clearly in chapter 18, right?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.760]   So the reason why she is called a harlot or a whore is because her sin is not of intimidation
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.400]   and fear, but is of sexual immorality, right?
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.000]   So the temptation or the people who are going to go after and basically side with her are
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.240]   people who are doing it voluntarily.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.000]   They're not doing it by fear.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.560]   They're voluntarily coming and surrendering themselves in allegiance to this prostitute,
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   okay?
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:35.040]   Again, that's why the term Babylon, she is the queen of Babylon.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.360]   It states that she is seated on waters.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   The significance of that is that in the ancient cities, most ancient cities of any significance,
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.400]   they were usually near sources of water, either ocean, river, or lake, or spring.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.720]   Why do you think that would be?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.400]   Right?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.560]   I mean, it's pretty common sense, right?
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:08.040]   If it's agricultural, if their primary source of income and sustenance and wealth is agricultural,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.880]   you would need to be near a body of water, or you have to somehow be able to access the
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.000]   body of water.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.440]   So most ancient cities, usually the more significant ones who had wealth typically were near a
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   body of water.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.700]   And the Babylon was no exception.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:29.840]   They were located near the river Euphrates, which was known to be in that area the greatest
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840]   source of water.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.760]   And the Babylon is located right near it, right?
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:45.360]   So she's described, when she sits on top of many waters, what do you think that signifies?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.680]   So if a city is located near a body of water, you assume that they naturally had wealth,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.680]   right?
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.960]   The agriculture, their livestock, basically they had food, sustenance that was able to
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.680]   be sustained by that water.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.480]   So if she is sitting on top of many waters, what does that signify about her?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.080]   Wealthy, powerful.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.280]   So it's to signify the greatness of who she is, right?
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.760]   Greatness and then when it says she's sitting above many waters, what does that mean?
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.320]   Possibly over not just one, but many other cities, right?
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:33.840]   Hence, we talk about how she has seven kings, ten horns, right?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.440]   Referring to many other nations, many other authorities.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   So she's sitting over many waters.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.480]   So again, to refer to the significance of who she is.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:48.240]   I put the passage in the wrong place here, but I'll get back to this later.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.800]   And so just to summarize, to sit upon many waters signifies the power and wealth of her
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.880]   influence over many nations.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.000]   So all of this is a description of this Queen of Babylon, right?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.820]   Queen of Babylon the Great, mother of prostitutes and earth abomination.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.000]   This is not some insignificant figure.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.840]   She's going to have worldwide influence and her primary influence isn't by force, isn't
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.120]   by power, but it's through temptation, sexual immorality.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.280]   Sexual immorality isn't necessarily just in reference to sex though, even though that's
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.640]   a huge part of it.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.080]   But sexual immorality is in reference to corruption of what's good, right?
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:40.120]   So again, oftentimes the temptation of the world is generally described as sexual immorality.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.760]   Things that tempt us and lure us away from God.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.480]   Whatever lusts that is not God-ordained, oftentimes it's just simply described as sexual immorality.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.200]   So that's a description of who she is.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.680]   She rides the scarlet beast.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.740]   This signifies that her power and influence is helped by the beast.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.740]   So she clearly is not the beast.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.560]   She is also described as being arrayed in purple and scarlet as well.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.440]   So what is the significance of the color purple?
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.720]   Royalty, right?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.480]   Anybody remember why?
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:33.880]   Why was the color purple equated with royalty?
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.560]   There's a significant figure in the New Testament in the book of Acts that there was this lady
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.160]   who was known to be a seller of purple garments.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.640]   Remember her name?
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   Lydia, right?
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.000]   Lydia was known for selling purple, specific purple garments, not just garments.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.680]   So purple garments were in particular, it's kind of like saying she was known for selling
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.560]   Gucci bags or something really expensive, right?
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.840]   That's about the most expensive thing I know.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.560]   What's more expensive than Gucci?
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.680]   All right, let's stick with Gucci, all right?
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:18.600]   So basically she's known for selling like very expensive stuff because that purple dye
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.340]   was very rare.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.880]   So anything purple was extremely expensive.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   So the fact that she was known to be a seller of purple material meant that she probably
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.720]   was a very wealthy lady, that she was somehow able to get that.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.280]   So anytime you see in the Bible where the color purple comes out, it's in reference
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.160]   to royalty, right?
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:49.760]   So she's described as having, the beast is described as a scarlet, right?
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.760]   Scarlet beast.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.880]   And she's also described as having scarlet, right?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.360]   Or sorry, the purple.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.920]   Okay, I got that mixed up.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.180]   So purple is associated with royalty and the color scarlet is often associated with immorality
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.600]   and sin in the Bible, right?
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.960]   So when you put those two things combined, what does that signify?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.620]   That she is wealthy, right?
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.800]   She's powerful and she's immoral, okay?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.320]   Those two things are together.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.680]   She is powerful.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:30.560]   So up to this point, a description of her is very powerful, right?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   Very immoral.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.600]   What was the other thing I missed?
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.800]   And royal, okay?
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.500]   So she has authority.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:45.000]   So these two colors combined signifies immoral and sinful rule of the beast and the harlot.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.440]   So again, remember we talked about how her rebellion and the beast are two separate.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.180]   And we're going to see why later, right?
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.480]   Even though the beast is helping her because she's riding the beast and somehow the beast
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:06.560]   is in control of her, using her, or helping her, but later on we're going to see, clearly
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.920]   see that they're not exactly the same.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.720]   So Satan himself in Revelation chapter 12, 3 is described as having seven heads and ten
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   horns.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.680]   So here when it's talking about the beast, this is probably in reference to Satan.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:33.860]   So Satan himself is assisting her to do what she's doing.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:39.000]   So even up to this point, we're not exactly sure who she is, right?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.120]   And in fact, to be honest, it is, ultimately it is a mystery, but we'll get to that in
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.360]   a minute.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.160]   She's also described as being drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of martyrs
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.080]   of Jesus.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:03.680]   So as she is tempting the world toward her, at the same time she's going after the saints.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:13.720]   And she's going to be responsible for great persecution against the Christians.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.900]   Now her identity, again, this is a guess, but some believe that her rule will be through
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:28.840]   false religion, that this is all a description of false religion because of the use of the
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.480]   word mystery to describe her.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.880]   Where else is the word mystery used in the Bible?
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.940]   Referring to the gospel.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:44.860]   So if you remember that we've been studying satanic activity and Satan has been trying
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.720]   to mimic the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:54.260]   So remember some of the things that Satan was doing to mimic God and his activity?
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.400]   Do you remember?
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.360]   Remember you had even the Trinity?
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.880]   You had Satan, the Antichrist, and then the false prophet.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.400]   And if you look at the description of the false prophet, it kind of mimics the Holy
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.620]   Spirit.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.260]   If you look at the description of the Antichrist, and he's exactly what that is, he's this Antichrist.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.780]   So whatever Christ does, he mimics.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:23.820]   So what does the Antichrist do that is mimicking Christ?
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.820]   Something very significant.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.140]   I think it was mentioned in chapter 14.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.620]   Huh?
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.180]   Okay, glorifies the beast, I mean, Satan, right?
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.180]   He brings attention.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.340]   So he draws people to himself and then points to Satan.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.780]   But how does he do that?
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.780]   Who said that?
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.780]   Right.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.780]   So that was a big thing.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.140]   Remember he said he seemed to have a mortal womb.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.180]   It doesn't say that he had a mortal womb.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.580]   He said he appeared to have a mortal womb.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.900]   And then what happens to him?
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.980]   And he comes back to life.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.500]   And as a result of that, people what?
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   Marvel.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.980]   They marvel at him.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.700]   They follow him and they worship him.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.300]   So what is that mimicking?
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.100]   Christ's death and resurrection.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.820]   So the Antichrist is mimicking Christ and his activity.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   And as a result of that, he gets the glory.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.220]   When he gets the glory, he points to Satan and empowers Satan.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.980]   So we've seen Satanic activity as mimicking the things of God to draw people away.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:34.140]   So the very things that we worship God for, Satan is mimicking to draw people away from
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.680]   God and then to give glory to Satan.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.540]   So some people believe that this is maybe in reference to false religion, partially
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.260]   because twice it mentions mystery.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.740]   And we know that the gospel of Jesus Christ clearly is referred to as the mystery of God
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.080]   that is being revealed.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:02.780]   And we also see that her kingdom is very distinct with Satan.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:09.580]   So even though they're holding hands, they work together for a short period it says.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.600]   The beast and the harlot and whatever she has authority over, they hold hands for a
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.840]   short period.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.720]   And why is she holding hands with the beast?
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.760]   Or why is the beast helping her and her helping the beast?
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.920]   To attack the Lamb of God.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.680]   To have basically to have a confrontation with the Lamb of God.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:41.000]   So clearly, even though Satan's activity is clear, what they're doing seems to be against
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.280]   even though they're working together, they're separate.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:57.320]   And then the angel comes in chapter 6 through 18 to explain what it is that John was seeing.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:04.520]   The beast is described as was and is not and is about to rise.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.800]   What do you think that's in reference to?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:13.580]   Was, is, and will be.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:20.440]   What does that sound like?
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.520]   The great I am, right?
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.680]   We're actually going to study that this Sunday, Romans 11, 36.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.800]   All things are from him, through him, and to him.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.400]   To God be the glory.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.040]   He is the alpha and omega.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.300]   He was and is and will be.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:46.440]   So Satan is described as was and is not and is about to rise.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.800]   And so again, you kind of see how Satan's title and what he's doing, he's all trying
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   to mimic God.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.280]   Like, what's the number of God?
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   777.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.200]   What's the number of the beast?
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   666.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.760]   And everything is just mimicking God.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.840]   Just that poorer version.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.440]   A more perverted version.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:15.080]   So if you really think about a rebellion against God, and all that we have, it's what God has
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.000]   given but perverted.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.640]   What is sexual immorality?
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.120]   It's not, immorality is not the sex itself.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.240]   It's sex outside of what God has ordained.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:38.000]   It's imitation of what God has ordained outside of God's boundaries, right?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.240]   It's a perversion of what God has given.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   What's the temptation with money?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.480]   Is the issue with money itself?
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.720]   No, it's a love of money.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.000]   But in its core, the problem is not the item itself.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.120]   It's a perversion of it.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   That's the temptation.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.080]   So Satanic work, and again, I've heard this since when I was young, I said the greatest
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.560]   temptation of mankind is not between good and bad.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:14.600]   When we identify something to be bad, it's still temptation, but the greatest battle
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.560]   is not between good and bad.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.440]   It's good and what's best.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.760]   And that's the distinction between the world and pursuit of God, right?
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   How much of our affections for Christ is squashed, not because of perversion, even though that
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.080]   is also the case, but usually good things, right?
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.520]   Remember when Jesus calls his disciples to come, the ones that say, "Oh, I can't go because
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.920]   I've got to bury my parents," or, "I've got to do this and that."
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.760]   And so the temptation typically is not between good and bad.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:57.840]   It's between what we perceive to be good versus what's best, right?
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.200]   Look at Adam and Eve.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.560]   What is their temptation?
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.440]   They wanted to eat, right?
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.680]   They wanted to be wise.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:13.520]   So what seemed good in their eyes was perversion of what God intended, right?
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.680]   So it wasn't like if you just put it on paper and looked at it, it's like, "Well, what was
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.120]   so bad about eating fruit?
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.840]   What was so bad about wanting to be wise?"
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.960]   It was a perversion of what God intended.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.080]   So look at satanic activity.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.720]   Satanic activity is trying to mimic God.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.440]   So we don't get deceived if Satan comes in his, you know, like what we see on television,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:43.600]   like, "I'm Satan," with fangs and pitchfork and with red garment, and you can clearly
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.200]   identify that's Satan.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.340]   So no one would be tempted to go there, right?
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:55.600]   Usually it's by scheming, by mimicking, by pretending, right, to draw you away from what
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.900]   is best.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.480]   So that's how Satan's activity is described for us.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.520]   So even his very title, "He was and is not and is about to rise," sounds like the death
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.040]   and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.720]   So everything he's doing is to deceive the world to think that, "Could that be Christ?
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   Could that be the Messiah?"
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:21.040]   Again, so this is most likely a reference to the false death and resurrection of the
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.720]   second beast in Revelation 13.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.400]   And those whose names was not written in the book of life will marvel at the beast because
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.740]   of this false resurrection, as also stated in Revelation 13.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:37.160]   So again, we see the same thing being mimicked in chapter 13, right?
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.200]   So this may be in reference to what he is doing, pretending to perform this spectacular
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.280]   miracle and, as I mentioned earlier, that they're not coming to him by force, right?
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:58.560]   They're naturally drawn to him because of what he is doing.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.480]   The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:09.040]   These are the nations that the woman rules through which will eventually be usurped by
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.520]   the beast.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.880]   So that's the part that I mentioned earlier in verse 11.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.960]   It says, "As a beast that was and is not and it is, an eighth, but it belongs to the
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.920]   seven and it goes to destruction."
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:28.360]   So again, that's a very confusing verse, but one of the commentators said that that
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.680]   may be in reference to his death and resurrection, right?
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.320]   That possibly he pretends to die and everybody marvels and then he comes back and that's
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.520]   why he is able to usurp the seven, right?
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.800]   He gained so much attention and love and awe and marvel of the world that he's able to
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.520]   usurp or overtake the seven.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:55.660]   And he becomes, he basically, the power is concentrated in him, okay?
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:11.280]   And then as a result of that, he uses that power to usurp, okay?
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.640]   Verse 10, starting from verse 9, "This calls for a mind with wisdom.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.980]   The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.400]   There are also seven kings, five of whom had fallen.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.760]   One is and the other has not yet come.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.320]   And when he does come, he must remain only a little while."
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.440]   So this is a part where it may be a description of what has already happened, okay?
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.840]   So of the seven kings, five of them have fallen.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.480]   One is, the other has not yet come.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   Anybody have any idea?
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.600]   Again, this is just an educated guess what that may be in reference to.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.620]   Out of the seven, five have already fallen.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:56.660]   So think about the time that John may be writing this, which kingdoms have already fallen?
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:09.920]   You had the Egypt, Assyria, the Babylonians, Persians, and Greek, right?
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.640]   So you had five kingdoms that have fallen.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   So which is?
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.800]   Five have already fallen and one is.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.660]   During the time that this is being written, the Romans existed.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:28.380]   And then he says the final kingdom that's going to challenge God has not come yet, okay?
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:36.640]   So some may say, well, maybe the United States, maybe England.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.760]   Probably not, right?
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.440]   It hasn't come yet.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:51.080]   Some have, maybe you've read, I actually have a whole book in my office that argues that
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.600]   the final kingdom is the Roman Catholic Church and the woman is in description of Catholic
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.880]   Church.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   And why do you think it's the Catholic Church?
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.280]   Because worship of Mary.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.340]   I mean, I don't necessarily believe that, but I have the book if you are interested
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.400]   in reading it.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.640]   But again, this is just one of the theories.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:27.460]   But whatever it is, the last kingdom has not come yet and it's still to be future.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.560]   The other one that has not yet come is Antichrist and final world empire.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   So it hasn't come yet.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:51.200]   Can I move?
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.760]   I think chapter 18 will be a little bit easier than chapter 17, a little bit, right?
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:02.640]   But chapter 17, I think of all the chapters, I think chapter 17 may be a little bit more
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.040]   difficult than the others.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.240]   The 10 horns are kings who will receive temporary power.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.980]   It says one hour, but I don't think it's literally one hour.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.820]   It's just a describing how it's going to be very short.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:28.200]   And what was the whole purpose of them giving that authority?
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.480]   For a short period, they're giving that authority and that authority was for the purpose of
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.920]   giving allegiance to Satan, the beast.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.480]   And he's going to basically consolidate the power.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.440]   And what's the first thing he's going to do?
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   Challenge the lamb.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.480]   So he raises up the kingdom.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.120]   He allows these kingdoms to come to power.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.720]   And so he's using false religion, basically.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.400]   Remember, I think I talked about that before.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:01.360]   I think the world unification, if we follow that interpretation, the world unification
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   is not going to be united because of economy or politics, but because of religion.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.880]   And so Satan is behind that, allowing that to happen, and he's going to consolidate this
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.920]   authority and power.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:21.120]   And so when Antichrist first comes, he hides himself as a political figure.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.280]   And then he performs this fake miracle where he seems to die and then comes back to life
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.560]   and he gains all.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.040]   And people begin to come to him and give him the authority.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.600]   And then all of a sudden he becomes this religious figure.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.200]   And then he gathers all of that authority to himself.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.720]   And then what does he do with that power?
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.880]   He goes after the lamb.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.980]   He challenges the lamb, right?
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:47.160]   Which I believe that's where the persecution is going to be the most intense for Christians.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.880]   So up to this point, it seems like that's what it's describing.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.800]   And just in practical application, if you think about the world events today, and again,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.160]   I don't like saying like, "Look at this, look at chapter this, and look at what's going
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.160]   on."
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.720]   But for the longest time, ever since I've started studying the book of Revelation, it
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:11.920]   just makes sense to me that, again, the Antichrist is described as coming as an angel of light.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:17.400]   Angel of light meaning that he's going to sell himself as a God figure.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:24.480]   And because he's challenging the church, he's challenging Christ, that I don't think he's
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.880]   going to come as a Muslim.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.960]   I don't think he's going to come as a different religion.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.240]   Because angel of light is going to be something that's going to mimic the truth, which is
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.040]   Christ, right?
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:43.880]   So this is my guess, and I've mentioned this before, that if you consider all the things
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:52.280]   that are happening today, that there is this natural hatred toward anything extreme because
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.520]   of the Islamic state and because of the beheading.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.260]   And so there's this distaste and hatred toward anything extreme.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.760]   So if you've been watching the news and the current affairs for the last maybe 10 years,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:13.000]   there's a subtle linking between the extreme Islamic, what they're doing, with Christian
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.360]   extremism, right?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.640]   And because they've been making that link, they can say harsh things about Christians,
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   saying that Christians shouldn't be in the government, Christians shouldn't have a bakery,
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.800]   Christians shouldn't do this, and there's been threats about shutting down churches,
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.060]   and this extreme language that would have been unheard of 15, 20 years ago.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:40.960]   But because of the Islamic extremism and because of this subtle linking of Muslim extremism
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:48.040]   and Christian extremism, that you can almost get away with specific persecution toward
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040]   anything extreme.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.680]   So what's happening is, right now, there's a movement toward everything coming toward
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.680]   the middle.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.920]   So again, if you've been following current affairs, there's a mass movement for liberal
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.800]   Christians, liberal Muslims, liberal Catholics to come together and hold hands.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.480]   So they're having services together, right?
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.880]   So I don't know if you guys remember when the previous Pope, Pope John, when he passed
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:18.480]   away, they had this mass worldwide celebration or burial for him, and they had Muslim clerics,
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.880]   they had Buddhist monks, and all these different people.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.760]   And then Billy Graham happened to run the service, and there was a heavy criticism toward
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.320]   Billy Graham because he participated in this.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.760]   But there's been a mass movement, even prior to what's been going on, there's been a mass
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.240]   movement toward everybody coming to the middle, because they don't want to see this extremism,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.760]   right, in any community.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.560]   So now, you know, more and more, there's always been a movement toward that, but especially
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.300]   in the last 10 years, right?
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.520]   And the stronger that movement becomes, anybody who's against it, anybody who won't join it,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.820]   well, remember what he's talking about, the mark of the beast?
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.160]   If you don't get the mark, what's the consequence, immediately?
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.480]   Do you remember?
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.320]   Economic, right?
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   Remember that?
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.200]   Anyone who does not get the mark of the beast is going to have economic problems, right?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.760]   And so if there, it seems like to me that at the end, there's going to be a religious
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   unification and maybe the people who are going to move against this are the, are you going
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.800]   to lead this movement, are the liberal Christians, which is exactly what's happening right now,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   right?
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.520]   The liberal Christians, the Unitarians are coming together and gathering everybody together,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.600]   and then if you listen to people of influence, at least on television, they're all part of
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.880]   this movement, right?
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.320]   Oprah.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:55.040]   Listen to anybody on television who says they're Christian and is widely accepted on television.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.420]   Hear their views carefully, whether they're news anchors, whether they're TV hosts.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.600]   If you are an evangelical Christian, you get shunned, right?
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.040]   You're a homophobe, you know, whatever you say, your core doctrines are considered hate
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:16.480]   speech, so, but they love liberal Christians who reject the inerrancy, who accept all faith,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   right?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.160]   All roads lead to God.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:25.120]   And so that's the movement that we see, and it seems like to me the Antichrist is going
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:32.020]   to basically move these things in so that it will happen, and eventually he's going
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:37.760]   to come out of this as the head of this, and then when he is revealed, finally, when he
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.680]   is revealed as the Antichrist, that's when he's going to like directly challenge, right?
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.400]   Instead of just bringing people to himself, once he gains the power, he's going to use
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.560]   that power to directly challenge God, right?
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.280]   And that's what we see.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:57.040]   And it says, "The ten horns and the beast will eventually despise the prostitute, and
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:03.000]   they will devour and destroy her as God had put into their heart to do," because ultimately,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.160]   Satan's desire is not to rule her, right?
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.920]   Satan is only using the false religion to gain notoriety for himself.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.320]   Ultimately his desire is not just to have a lesser portion.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.480]   He wants to ultimately challenge God, right?
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.160]   But all of this, at the end of it, it says it's God-ordained.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.120]   Satan and his minions are going to challenge her and overthrow her, and he's going to step
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.440]   into power, and he says, "God has allowed all of this.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.600]   He put it in their heart to do this," because in the end, God's going to use all of that.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.620]   Remember, I said a such strong delusion is going to come at the end that even the elect,
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.600]   if it was possible, that they would be deceived.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.720]   That's how strong the delusion is going to be.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.880]   He's going to allow Satan to have that kind of power at the very end.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.060]   And so anyone who's nominal, anyone who doesn't have genuine faith, anyone who's been kind
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.800]   of putting one foot in and one foot out, he said, "The illusion is going to be so strong
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:11.440]   that today our biggest problem is it's hard for us to identify who is and is not of genuine
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   faith," right?
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.940]   In fact, we have to be very careful that we don't judge.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.380]   But at the end, he says we don't have to judge because the delusion is going to divide the
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.940]   people as it is, right?
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.700]   And so that's how chapter 17 ends, and then chapter 18 is going to take us into the fall
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:33.420]   of Babylon and the specifics of how Babylon is going to fall, okay?
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:40.180]   Let me go over the questions before.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.800]   Why do you think false religion, both outside of Christianity and inside Christianity, is
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.840]   such a powerful force in the world?
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:53.600]   Now we know, you know, if you're sitting here, obviously, 99% of you, if not all of you,
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.840]   we know how to identify false religion, right?
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.920]   I mean, they're not Christian.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   They don't worship Christ.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.560]   They don't have the same gospel.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.160]   And we know how to identify false religion in Christianity if they're liberal.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.600]   They reject inerrancy.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.280]   They don't believe in the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.040]   And so we know that there's liberalism there.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:21.660]   But false religion isn't simply identified by wrong doctrine, right?
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.160]   Bible talks about that, that you can have the right doctrine and still have demonic
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.620]   faith.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.040]   So false religion isn't just not having right doctrine.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.760]   You can have the right doctrine and have false religion, correct?
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.920]   Because the Bible tells us that, right?
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   You can be at church.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.040]   You can have the right doctrines.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.040]   You can have the right Bible.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.840]   You can go to the right church and be committed to false religion if the God that you worship
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.360]   is a God that you created in your own mind, right?
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:56.800]   Again, maybe not doctrinally, but you've never fully surrendered your life to Christ, right?
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.160]   You call me Lord, Lord, but your heart is far from me.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.520]   So we have the right confession, but wrong heart and wrong life.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.080]   So false religion is not just an issue of wrong doctrine.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:12.700]   False religion can also be very much part of the church that has right doctrine, right?
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:19.880]   So why do you think that false religion is so powerful and so deceiving?
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   That's the first question.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.520]   Number two, Satan's rule and sexual morality seem to go hand in hand.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:30.400]   Why do you think sexual sin is such a powerful force against the things of Christ?
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.360]   What role does God-ordained sex have in God's sovereign plan in creation?
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:42.000]   Now I can tell you as a pastor, if I sit down and talk to most pastors that have been in
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.600]   ministry for a while, especially the ones working with a younger group, but it's not
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.760]   limited to the younger group.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:53.240]   This is a problem no matter how old you are, that we say, "What is the biggest struggle
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:59.800]   in the church that distracts people from really giving their life to Christ?"
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.040]   Pornography right now is such a big problem, right?
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:13.280]   In fact, just today I was reading an article where in Canada they were trying to do a survey
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.560]   of the mindset and the heart condition and the thinking of somebody in their late teens
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:26.080]   and early 20s who was exposed to pornography, who are on a regular exposure to pornography
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.640]   versus somebody who has not been at all, right?
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.840]   And they were trying to do a study in comparison and at the end they ended up giving up.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.120]   Do you know why?
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.040]   Because they couldn't find any subject who wasn't exposed.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.080]   That's how rampant it is, right?
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.640]   You would think that maybe they went to church and asked some Christians, born-again Christians,
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.320]   or maybe gathered some pastors together.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.840]   Maybe they could have been the subject, but they ended up not being able to do the studies
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.320]   because they couldn't find any subjects.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.660]   That's how rampant it is.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:03.640]   And so if it's that rampant, what kind of effect does that have in the spiritual condition
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.720]   of the church, right?
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.920]   We can talk about discipleship, discipline, prayer, having right doctrine, but if the
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:16.520]   undercurrent of the church, there is sexual sin being practiced regularly and we're constantly
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   giving ourselves to that, how does that affect the way we listen to the Word of God?
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.360]   How does that affect our prayer life?
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.600]   How does that affect our evangelism?
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.820]   I mean, it completely wrecks it, right?
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:36.900]   And so sexual sin, in the end, is a perversion of what God had created, and it is one of
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.380]   the strongholds, not one of the, it is the stronghold that is mentioned over and over
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.940]   in Scripture.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:48.740]   So again, what role does God-ordained sex have in God's sovereign plan in creation,
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.020]   right?
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:58.140]   So my prayer is that tonight, and I know this is a sensitive subject and it is intense,
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:05.800]   and this is both for men and women, that you're able to be honest with one another and to,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.300]   you know, I think it's important for us to recognize that we all struggle with this,
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:15.060]   because you can't confess and be forgiven for a sin that you're unwilling to confess,
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.120]   right?
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.280]   But if we recognize that this is, we don't want to normalize the sin, and then it's like,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.520]   "Oh, we all struggle with it," you know what I mean?
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.000]   And then it just becomes okay.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.640]   And we don't want to create that kind of environment either.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.960]   But neither do we want to create an environment where we just pretend that that's not what
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.040]   we're struggling with, right?
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.320]   So if we're going to wrestle with it together, if we're going to keep each other accountable,
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.800]   the first thing that we need to do is to be honest, right?
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.760]   Yes, this has been hindering my prayer life.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.440]   This has been hindering my desire to evangelize.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.160]   It's hindering my Bible study.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.840]   It's hindering my fellowship.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.120]   It's hindering my marriage, right?
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.380]   And be honest with it and be open with one another, right?
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.600]   So you can take some time to pray.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.760]   Third, what is the one temptation that Satan can put forth in your life that you would
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.440]   have a difficult time resisting?
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.420]   And this is a hypothetical.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.680]   What is one thing in your life you have a difficult time giving lordship over to God
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   currently?
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.760]   So one is hypothetical, the other is reality.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.320]   So if we can take some time to, again, to confess and take some time to pray over these
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   things.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:30.280]   If Satanic work primarily is not forcing us but tempting us and drawing us away, right?
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.120]   Then we're just naturally drawn to these things.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.040]   So Satan is a master of that.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:41.600]   He was angel of light before he fell, meaning he's beautiful.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.660]   He's attractive.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.660]   He's not ugly.
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.560]   He doesn't have fangs, right?
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.720]   So his temptation, he knows exactly what's going to tempt us.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.340]   And it's part of the reason why the church is so important for us, right?
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.360]   As a community that we're able to share and openly share with one another so that we can
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.400]   fight these things together.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.240]   So again, all of these things are things that I'm hoping that you guys would take some time
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.400]   to be honest and open with one another.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.040]   And it's not just to say, "Oh, I'm open," right?
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.600]   If we do that, then we start normalizing.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.160]   It's like, "Oh, everybody struggles."
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.840]   So I don't feel as bad because I thought I was the only one, but we all struggle with
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.840]   it.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.800]   And then all of a sudden, you just normalize sin.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.960]   And again, that's not the goal at all.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.600]   Hopefully that will lead to the second part of it is learn to hate that sin because of
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.480]   the effects of it and then to fight together.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.560]   So let me pray for us and then I'll give you guys time to discuss with your group.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:49.920]   Heavenly Father, we confess our weakness.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:56.360]   We confess, Father God, that we don't think enough about the spiritual battle that you've
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:02.080]   warned us about, Father, that it is not against flesh and blood, that it's not simply by our
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:10.200]   hard work or being smart or being organized or even simply accountability.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.400]   We know, Father, that this is a spiritual battle and Satan is constantly working to
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.520]   devour your children.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.600]   Help us, Lord God, to remain sober.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:26.120]   I pray that you would strengthen this church, Lord God, and that we would not allow Satan
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.540]   to have a grip on our lives, Lord, because of our sins.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:35.120]   Help us to confess it, to be forgiven, to be washed by the blood of Christ, that Satan
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.960]   would not be able to scheme, Lord God, to shame us in front of you.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.480]   And so we pray, Father, that all of these things that we are studying, that even though
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:50.040]   we may not fully understand the details, we know, Father God, how Satan works and you
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.240]   reminded us, Lord God, to stay sober.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.440]   So I pray for your grace.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.920]   I pray for your Holy Spirit.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.400]   I pray that in our weakness that Christ may be shown to be powerful.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.520]   So we ask for vulnerability.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.180]   We ask for your grace.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:13.520]   We ask, Lord God, for community, true community, Lord God, and just asking, Father, for you
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.520]   to empower your church through your forgiveness.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.160]   So again, we entrust this time to you.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
