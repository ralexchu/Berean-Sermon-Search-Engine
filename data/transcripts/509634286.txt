[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 22, verse 15.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.200]   We're going to take some time this morning before I jump into the book of Hebrews to
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.120]   talk about the significance of communion.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.680]   So there's a...
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.440]   You know, there's some people who may go to church in and out and they're, again, not
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.680]   really understanding the significance of some of the things that we do at church.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.820]   And so there's a tendency to think that the most important things that we need to practice
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.680]   is tell us what to do, right?
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.880]   How do we raise children about finance, about evangelism, about making disciples?
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.760]   But when it comes to maybe baptism and communion, those are things for like, for religious people,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.520]   for you know, the pastors.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.480]   We learned this in seminary, but for the regular people, it really doesn't matter.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.880]   There's nothing in the Bible that differentiates between...
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.120]   These are important for pastors, but regular people, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.480]   When the Bible says not to turn from it to the left or to the right, that's a command
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.400]   for the whole church, for all of us.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.800]   So we need to be careful that we don't participate in things that we don't understand for religious
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.840]   reasons because, you know, if you look at the nation of Israel, before they went into
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.640]   captivity, they were very religious.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.360]   They were at the temple doing what God told them to do, and yet God would call them evil
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.360]   assemblies, that their worship was a burden to them because they were going through it
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.560]   through the motion, obeying the letter of the law, but they have no understanding of
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.240]   the spirit of the law, why God gave those laws to begin with.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.760]   So we want to make sure that as a church, that we are not just reformed in theology,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.040]   but that we are continuing to reform.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.520]   That everything that we're doing in church, we're doing out of obedience to what we see
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.120]   in scripture.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.400]   And so obviously this leads us to communion.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.760]   Communion is one of those things that if we don't understand what we're doing, it just
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.680]   becomes a religious practice that we do and say, "Well, it means the body, it means the
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.080]   blood, but why do we do it this way?"
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.120]   You know, you do it that way, this church does it that way, so it must not be significant.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.760]   Since there is no complete agreement, so whenever there isn't 100% agreement, it must not be
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   important.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   And it's dangerous for us to approach the scriptures that way because there isn't 100%
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720]   agreement in anything in scripture, even the gospel.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   And so if we dismiss something simply because there isn't 100% agreement, we're in danger
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.800]   of us picking and choosing what we think is important and what's not important.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.360]   So we want to make sure that as we continue to practice communion, that this is taught
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.600]   in our BCC class, but we also want to make sure that whether you are new to the church
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.040]   or whether you've been in here for a while, that there's nothing that we do, especially
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   the communion table, which is so sacred in a way that we don't fully get what we're doing
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.560]   and why we're doing what we're doing and how we're doing what we're doing.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.280]   So we want to take some time, and again, I'm probably already turned off some of you, right?
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.400]   We're going to spend the whole day just talking about communion, but again, we believe it's
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.920]   important enough that we want to make sure we're on the same page.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.240]   Luke chapter 22, 15, again, we're going to be in various passages, but we want to look
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.320]   at the central thing that Jesus gave us before and what initiated this communion, this Lord's
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   table.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.000]   In Luke 22, verse 15, "He said to them, 'I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   with you before I suffer.'"
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.080]   This is before Jesus goes to the cross.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.880]   Verse 19, "And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.120]   to them, saying, 'This is my body, which is given for you.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.320]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   And in the same way, He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, 'This cup, which
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.400]   is poured out for you, is the new covenant in my blood.'"
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.760]   So let's pray, and then we'll jump into the text.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued grace.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.320]   Help us to have a deepening understanding of what you have commanded the church to practice,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.860]   the significance of it and what it was given us for, that we would be sustained, strengthened,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.320]   and to be matured, Lord God, so that we may be anchored in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.280]   Again, if you've been raised in the church, so maybe your parents were Christians or maybe
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.520]   you went to church early, in elementary school or high school, there are certain things that
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   you do without fully engaging, without fully understanding why these things are done.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.560]   Every once in a while, somebody might challenge you and say, "Oh yeah, why do we do that?"
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.920]   Or maybe you'll go to another church that practices it a different way, and then you
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.840]   might ask, "Huh, I wonder why they do it this way?"
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.400]   And then, so you might dig further to properly understand, or you might just say, "Well,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.500]   you know, we have differences of opinion, but we don't really dig further."
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.100]   And then we have the superficial questioning of why are there denominations?
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.960]   Why can't we just get along?
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.640]   God clearly must not be happy with denominations, so therefore, anything that causes any kind
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.440]   of division in the church should not be emphasized too much.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.040]   Let's just talk about what we agree on.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.080]   Jesus loved us, died for us, resurrected on the third day, and we should gather together
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   to celebrate that.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.020]   And outside of that, don't talk about it too much, or it'll divide the church.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.840]   That is the misunderstanding, and again, a very dangerous approach to the scripture,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   because by doing so, all kinds of false doctrines enter into the church because we're not paying
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.240]   attention.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.600]   We have to make sure that we understand all of scripture, that we are practicing all of
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   it.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.440]   In fact, I have found that the more we pay attention to scripture, the more we practice
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.000]   the details of what the scripture says, I actually find a greater unity, not only within
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.360]   the church, even outside the church.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.080]   Whenever I see another pastor, another church that really is dedicated to the verse-by-verse,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.640]   careful analysis of what the scripture says, I find complete union with that person or
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.600]   with that church, more than you could say you're a Baptist or just have a name title,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.560]   but you're not studying the scripture.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.800]   And superficially, we seem united, but in reality, we're not.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.160]   You know where it first hit me, where there's so many traditions that we practice that we
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.360]   don't really understand, was when I first started officiating weddings.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.560]   Because I grew up in the church, so I just assumed a lot of things.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.080]   I just saw what my parents did, what my dad did, or what I was taught, and I just started
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.840]   practicing it in the church because the seminary doesn't, at least the seminary I went to,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.240]   doesn't teach us how to do all these things, right?
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.880]   We learn the scripture, but the practice of it, it's not really emphasized.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.560]   But I remember the very first wedding that I officiated, I was very nervous.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.860]   I was very nervous because it's a very important time, and you have adults and children and
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.000]   all different groups of people from various backgrounds coming, and I wanted to make sure
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.320]   that I did it right.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.360]   So I felt more nervous than the very first time I gave my sermon because I wanted to
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360]   make sure I got it right.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.720]   But obviously, I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.640]   So I was going off of what I remembered, right?
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.360]   What my wedding was like or a wedding that I participated in.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.600]   So I was just getting things from just from memory.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.880]   And this is before Google, right?
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.800]   I couldn't just go to the internet and say, "Okay, what is a Christian wedding supposed
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   to look like?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720]   What are the elements you're supposed to do and not do?"
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.200]   So I was just going off of memory.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.920]   I was asking people, but again, there weren't a lot of people that I could ask at that time.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.560]   So I remember the very first wedding, and it was a former youth student that used to
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.480]   be in my youth group, graduated, met her fiance, asked me to officiate the wedding.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.920]   And I remember the practice.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.280]   We showed up, and any of you who participated in that wedding, there's a lot of like, "You
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.000]   should do this and you shouldn't do this," right?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.400]   So they started asking me questions.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   Where do we stand?
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   So I'm just remembering.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   You just stand right there, you know?
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.320]   Well, where do the grooms, where do they stand?
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.480]   I guess you stand here.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.800]   And during the ceremony, like, there's an announcement.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.680]   Who gives the announcement?
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   I guess the father does.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.360]   So I'm just trying to remember all this stuff.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.560]   And then all throughout the thing, I'm trying to remember the tradition, but I don't remember
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.120]   the significance.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.960]   And I remember thinking, I don't know if I saw it in a wedding or I saw it in a movie
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   somewhere.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.920]   You know, I know that they throw rice at people.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   Is that Christian?
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.160]   It's like, okay, I don't understand that.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.520]   And then there's a part of the wedding where they would ask, "If anybody has anything against
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.600]   these two people getting married, speak now forever, hold your peace."
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.040]   That's a weird thing to ask in the middle of a wedding.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.320]   And I was thinking, they should have said that before they came to the wedding.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.640]   Why are they waiting until right before they get married to say that?
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.920]   I said, "No, I'm not going to do that."
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.080]   And I remember just kind of trying to figure this out at the practice.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.800]   And one of the moms asked me, the mom of the groom, you know, the side that I didn't know.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   I knew the bride's side, but I didn't know the groom's side.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.480]   She asked me, like, at the end of the wedding, who's supposed to go out first?
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.280]   Do the groom's side go out first or the bride's side go out first?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.720]   And I was just like, "Hmm."
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.680]   And I hesitated for a minute, for a second, you know, because I'm trying to figure out,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.880]   I'm winging this thing from the beginning to the end, right?
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.960]   I didn't want to act like I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.640]   But the mother of the bride saw that I was hesitating and she grabbed the other mother
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.160]   of the groom and pulled her aside and whispered in her ear where I heard, "Don't ask him because
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.480]   he doesn't know either."
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.880]   That's what she said.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.720]   And I was so nervous going into that practice, but after she said that, it's like, "Okay,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   there you go.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.140]   Forget this, you know, this is going to be a big joke."
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.880]   After that, obviously, after that wedding, we got through it.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.520]   And starting from the next wedding, I wanted to make sure, right?
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.680]   Why is the bride wearing white?
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680]   Why is there a middle aisle?
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.640]   Why do they light candles?
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.440]   Why is there thanking of the parents?
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   Why is there this?
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   Why is there benediction?
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.880]   Why is there, how do they pray for this?
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   And so I wanted to make sure.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.160]   And then, so I just kind of took out the things that I didn't fully understand.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.120]   And I realized that there wasn't really a standard.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.440]   It's not like a biblical standard, like the Bible says to do this, because there is no
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.060]   instructions in the Bible.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.120]   It just came from tradition.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.360]   So which tradition you follow.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.680]   So you'll see if you go to a wedding, their basic elements are similar.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.320]   I would say 90% is similar.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.120]   And then there's 10%, you know, sometimes they take off their shoes and wash their feet
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.520]   and do various things.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.920]   But there is no, you can or cannot do, because it's not instructed in the Bible, right?
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.020]   Now I say all of that to introduce to you, sometimes the things that we do in the church,
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.760]   we don't really realize is that biblical or is that not biblical?
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.800]   Because it's just been done.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   It's tradition.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.040]   If you go to church, you're supposed to be baptized, right?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.960]   You give offerings, somebody gives a sermon, you know, and then we have fellowship, and
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.840]   then we have discipleship, we have evangelism, we have short-term missions.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.280]   So you have all these elements that the churches do, and there's some things that are clearly
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.360]   biblical that's being taught, and then there are some things that may be biblical, but
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.280]   you don't understand the meaning behind it, but you just do it out of tradition, right?
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.200]   Because it was taught.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.640]   But because you do it out of tradition and you don't understand the significance of what
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.320]   it is, it doesn't benefit you the way it's supposed to.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.560]   It is ordained for a reason.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:38.320]   The Bible gives us two ordinances, the baptism and communion that is elevated above everything
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.480]   else that we do at church.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.680]   It's not because we elevated it, the Bible elevated it, and this is universal in all
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.640]   the churches.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.080]   Whether you are a Presbyterian or a Methodist or whatever denomination you come from, the
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:59.080]   fact that these two ordinances were given to us in the church is agreed upon.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.480]   The meaning and practice of it may be different, but the fact that they are ordained in the
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.100]   church to be elevated and to be taken seriously is universally accepted.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:17.280]   So as we practice communion, we want to make sure that just like we're doing baptism, we're
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.940]   reviewing baptism, and are we practicing it the way that the Bible teaches, and are there
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.360]   biblical things that we can stand upon and give you evidence that this is the reason
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.720]   why we do what we do?
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.280]   In the same way, we want to make sure that our church, not just the pastors, not just
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.960]   the elders, our church understands this thing that we do every other month.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.840]   Some of you may come from churches that do it every week.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.760]   Some of you came from churches that did it once a month.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.080]   Some of you may have come from churches that don't practice it at all.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.200]   Why do they do it that way?
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.680]   Why do we choose to do it every other week?
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.800]   What are the ways and what are the reasoning behind this?
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   So the text that we read in Luke chapter 22, 15 to 19, to start off, it clearly says that
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.960]   Jesus as he was participating in the Passover meal, he says to do this in remembrance of
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   me.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.400]   In other words, what the Jews were doing, what the Israelites were doing to commemorate
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.560]   the Passover was now to be taken and to be applied to Christ.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.120]   So the most clearest understanding of the communion comes from the Lord's table before
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.000]   Jesus goes to the cross, to do this in remembrance of me.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.240]   So the first part, I want to make sure that we understand what does the Bible teach us
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.800]   about the meaning behind this, right?
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:44.560]   I'm going to go over the first different views that people have of communion and then I'll
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.640]   start with the meaning behind the Baptist meaning.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.600]   The Roman Catholics believe in transubstantiation, which literally means that the elements actually
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.880]   physically become the blood of Christ and the body of Christ.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.200]   It actually converts into that.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.720]   Obviously we don't believe that, but that's what the Catholics believe.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.400]   The Lutherans believe in consubstantiation, that they're a step below that where they
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.600]   don't think that the elements actually turn into the body and the blood, but the actual
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.920]   body and the blood appears at the communion table with, alongside, that's what consubstantiation
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.920]   means.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.120]   Obviously we don't believe that either.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.200]   The Presbyterians believe what's called a sacramental memorial.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.320]   Sacramental memorial is the primary meaning behind it is a memorial, is for the purpose
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.560]   of remembering.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.900]   But it's a sacramental memorial, meaning that they believe in the dynamic presence of Christ,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:44.640]   that in the element of itself, when it is participated, there is grace given to everybody
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.180]   in the element itself.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.420]   So there is a dynamic presence of Christ in the communion.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:58.660]   The Baptist view of the communion is memorial for the purpose of remembering, reviving.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:04.940]   It's kind of like celebrating an event and you have a memorial in order to remind people
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.060]   so that we do not forget, so that whatever it is that we are to do going forward, that
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.060]   we don't forget.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.940]   That's why when you have important events in history, they set up memorials, right?
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.740]   If you go to New York, they have memorials for the people who died there and they have
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:25.700]   a memorial for the firefighters and for the police officers who gave their life in sacrifice.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.900]   Why did they have that there?
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.940]   So that people will not forget the sacrifice, that they may be honored for the life that
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.340]   they gave for that purpose.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.860]   That's why they have memorials.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.900]   So baptism, from our point of view, from what I see in scripture, what Jesus says,
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:45.020]   to do this in remembrance of me, in remembrance of me.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:51.660]   So when we participate in this communion, there is no power in these elements.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.660]   You can't take this into your car and then drink it and say, "I feel it."
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.420]   There is no power in itself.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.220]   You can't just participate in it.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.940]   Somehow God has ordained this bread and God has ordained this drink and all of a sudden
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.060]   there's something supernatural going on inside because you happen to participate in it.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:14.820]   It's what it signifies and what it causes us to remember as a memorial that has the
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.020]   benefit, right?
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.540]   So if we think that way, some people think that, well, if that's the case, if it's
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.500]   just a memorial, why do we take it seriously?
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.500]   It's just a symbol.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.820]   Can we do anything, right?
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.860]   We're going to get to that, right?
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.660]   Because the Bible doesn't present that even though it is a memorial, the Bible just doesn't
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.940]   say, "Well, since it's a memorial, it's not important.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.420]   In fact, it is very sacred," right?
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.900]   It is only one of two ordinances given to us.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:48.220]   The word "ordinance," before we get into the meaning of the Passover, the word "ordinance,"
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.300]   at some point, I forget if it was in November or December, remember the governor of the
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.600]   state passed an ordinance that there was going to be a curfew at 10 o'clock.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.060]   So what does that ordinance mean?
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.740]   A law, right?
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:06.420]   A law that is passed that everyone is supposed to obey, which nobody obeyed.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.540]   I don't know a single person who even knows that that even existed, right?
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.020]   People didn't take it seriously, but at least that's what it means by an ordinance, like
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:21.140]   a set of rules that's supposed to govern wherever that law has authority.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.040]   And so in the Scripture, the local church, two ordinances have been given, the baptism
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.980]   and the Lord's Supper.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.420]   So we want to make sure, we want to make sure that the Bible is handled correctly.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.660]   We want to make sure that the fellowship reflects who God is, that we do evangelism.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.860]   But above all the things that the church has been called to do, there's only two things
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:48.100]   that are elevated as an ordinance, baptism and communion.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.540]   So we want to make sure, right?
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.680]   We want to make sure that we don't just simply dismiss that and say, "Oh, we're not completely
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.500]   united so therefore it's not important."
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.060]   It's an ordinance.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.380]   You can't simply say, "We're not united so it's not important."
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:08.060]   It's because it's important that we need to pay extra attention that we apply it biblically.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.860]   And so that's why we visited about the baptism and certain things are being taught and certain
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.820]   things being practiced because we want to be, we want to respect what the Bible says,
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.100]   not to turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.260]   And we want to do the same thing when it comes to communion.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.940]   That you understand that this thing that we do every other month, what is the significance
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.540]   of it and what is it supposed to do and why do we practice it the way that we practice
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.540]   it?
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:40.700]   So, first of all, because Jesus said in the Passover meal to do this in remembrance of
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.980]   me, there's three things that the Passover meal was supposed to cause them to remember.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.980]   Okay, three things.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:54.900]   The first thing is, the first thing of the Passover meal was a celebration of God's
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.860]   deliverance of Israel, right?
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:02.420]   That's the clearest and the obvious and the plainest teaching of the Passover meal.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:08.340]   So you remember the Passover where God's Spirit comes and he judges the nation of Egypt and
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:14.420]   he says to put the lamb's blood on the doorpost and as a result of the lamb's blood, the angel
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.580]   of death crosses over and they are delivered.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.900]   So that's why it's called the Passover.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:26.220]   So every time they commemorated this, the Passover, they would remember by God's protection,
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.860]   the lamb of the blood caused them to be saved.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.740]   And that's what it says in Exodus chapter 13, 3, "Moses said to the people, 'Remember
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.620]   this day in which you went out from Egypt from the house of slavery, for by a powerful
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:44.900]   hand the Lord brought you out from this place and nothing leavened shall be eaten.'"
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.300]   And so every time they had the Passover meal, it was to remind them of God's deliverance
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.740]   for them.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.460]   That the only reason why they even exist is because God was merciful.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.460]   God delivered them.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.020]   They didn't work hard to get out of slavery.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.440]   They didn't overpower the Egyptians.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:08.140]   God supernaturally had mercy and had a power encounter with the Egyptian idols and delivered
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.340]   them by mercy.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:16.540]   So it was to constantly cause them to remember, you live because of Him.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.440]   That's what they were to remember.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.900]   And so when we come to the New Testament, when Jesus says to do that in remembrance
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:27.900]   of me, He says all of that what the Israelites were doing was to prepare for the real deliverance
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.380]   that was going to come in Christ.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.180]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 26, "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:40.580]   proclaim the Lord's death until He comes so that we would not forget."
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.980]   That we would not forget.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.500]   You know, again, I think in the last 10 years there was this movement, like the gospel-centered
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.500]   movement.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.900]   We need to get back to the gospel.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:56.300]   And I think the important part of that movement was it's true.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:03.460]   The moment we begin to drift away from what saved us, we can easily drift to think and
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.980]   to be sidetracked to think somehow that if we work hard enough, if we find the right
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.820]   method, if we write the right books, if we have the right leader, somehow revival is
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.860]   going to come.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:20.140]   It was to constantly cause the nation of Israel to remember so that they do not drift from
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140]   their salvation.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.900]   And it is to remind us.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:31.040]   Because there's so many things in our life that can easily cause us to be distracted.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.420]   If you were going to Hawaii on a little, tiny little sailboat, right, and you may have heard
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:44.200]   this illustration before, but you don't need to change the boat from here to here to get
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.740]   you off target.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.720]   All you need is a slight change of direction.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.820]   That in the beginning seems like nothing, but after you've traveled four or five miles,
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.560]   you could be hundreds of miles away.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.800]   And that's why when the Bible says not to drift, drifting is when we're not clearly
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.960]   anchored in Christ, little things that we do causes us to drift toward things ultimately
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.560]   will lead us completely away from God.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.120]   So when people fall away from God, most of the time they can't point to something and
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.520]   say, "Oh, this is when I decided to fall away from God."
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.160]   They can't have, there's not a clear point where it says, "Oh, I rejected God at this
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.640]   point."
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.200]   At some point in their life, they gave into their compromise.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.680]   At some point in their life, they didn't take their faith seriously.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.560]   At some point in their life, they began to slightly drift.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.600]   And that slight drift a year later, five years later, 10 years later, 30 years later, you
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.800]   end up waking up one day, "How did I get here?
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   I remember when I was in college, I was willing to give my life for Christ.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.880]   I was going to missions.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.600]   I wanted to marry a missionary and I want to do all this stuff."
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.800]   Twenty years later, after tiny compromise, one after another, you realize you are so
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.940]   far away from God and you can't pinpoint exactly when this happened.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.840]   It just happened because we forgot.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.680]   We just continue to drift.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.480]   God knew.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.240]   God knew exactly what our tendency is.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.800]   And I think there's many of us, even in this room and all over the world, who they can
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.280]   look back at a certain stage in their life and say, "You know, man, I wish I could turn
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.320]   the clock back to when I was back then.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.560]   But now the worries of life, concerns about retirement, about paying bills, about raising
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.720]   children has got me all caught up and I've drifted.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.320]   And I know I've drifted, but how do I get back?"
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.520]   You know, our human tendency is when we see people drifting, like we have to switch programs.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.680]   We have discipleship programs.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.360]   We have leadership programs.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.880]   We have one-to-one programs.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.920]   We have older brothers looking out for younger brothers, senior to freshman.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:52.040]   So we establish all of these things, saying like, "If we wanted to get back to God, we
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.760]   need to implement this."
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:00.600]   Well, none of those things are wrong, but none of those things are explicitly written
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   in Scripture.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   The only thing that is explicitly written in Scripture is to fix your eyes upon Christ,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.520]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.440]   We've been studying the book of Hebrews because they were drifting away, right?
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.920]   They weren't denouncing His deity.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.400]   They weren't saying that He wasn't resurrected from Christ.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   They just drifted.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.280]   They didn't take seriously the weightiness of what they had.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.240]   So because they were drifting, the solution to their drifting is Christ.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.560]   So we spent 10 chapters, from chapter 1 to chapter 10, and then in chapter 11, being
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.760]   reminded about the supremacy of Christ.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.840]   Because what God gave us so that we do not drift is to constantly remember what saved
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.960]   us to begin with.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.360]   In the book, Ask Guinness, "No God but God," he describes three generations that
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.840]   lead to apostasy.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.800]   The first generation are the ones who convert, and they're the builders.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.040]   They're the sacrificial ones.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.200]   And then their children are the second generation where they become lukewarm, where the passion
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.060]   that they had initially starts to wane at the end of their life, and their children
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.680]   remember who they were at the end of their life.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.120]   And so they inherit the form without the power.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.060]   So they become lukewarm.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.880]   But the lukewarm Christian at the end of their life begins to drift so far away from God
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:30.400]   that with the third generation, all they remember is the tail end of the lukewarm life.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.120]   And so that's how he says in his study, by third generation, there's apostasy.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:42.740]   So if you're part of the first generation that received Christ, tendency is, and don't
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.840]   accept this tendency.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.120]   We need to fight this tendency.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.320]   But the tendency is if we do not continue to anchor in Christ all our life, our next
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.560]   generation is going to inherit the church, inherit the Sunday school, inherit VBS, inherit
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.080]   the form without the passion, without the faith.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.960]   But that's not where apostasy happened.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.120]   Apostasy happens in the third generation because there was nothing for them to inherit at the
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.520]   tail end of the second generation, and the third generation just walks away from their
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   faith.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.480]   And this is why the communion table is so important.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.080]   Not the form, not putting this in our body and say, "Well, I did it, so I have somehow
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.720]   sustenance," but why it was given to us.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:34.320]   As a pastor, my constant struggle is when I forget what saved me, what I value, and
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.600]   why I came into ministry, it just becomes a job.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.120]   It just becomes a job.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.760]   And when it just becomes a job, it's unbearable.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.160]   And so I have to constantly fight in my heart, not just through communion, but through devotions,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   through prayer, through fellowship.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.600]   I have to constantly remind it, "Why did I start this?"
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:01.200]   For the moment I drift from that and it becomes a job, it's not worth it.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:09.240]   As Christians, if you forget and you start to drift, eventually you have to salvage something
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.800]   from the church, right?
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.840]   Because if it's not your devotion, if it's not your love for Christ and Christ's love
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:21.080]   for you that's drawing you to church, something else is drawing you to church.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.240]   And usually it's people.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.160]   So when people are nice to you, when you fit in and you're loved and you're part of a community,
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.680]   it's great, but as soon as that starts to break down, I don't want to go to church anymore
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   because the church is filled with hypocrites.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:39.360]   So at some point in their walk with God, the fellowship became the primary thing because
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.280]   they've drifted away from what is central.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.800]   Again, when that happens, there's no, you can't pinpoint at one point that happens,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   but you know in your heart when that happens.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.880]   It's no longer the love for Christ, it's no longer his sacrifice that's drawing me to him,
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   it's the people.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.600]   A church that forgets and begins to drift, it becomes nothing more than a social gathering
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.200]   for social purposes.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.120]   Where you know, we need to salvage, why are we gathered together?
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   We have these resources, we have homeless people, we have sex trafficking, and so we
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.520]   want to do good.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.160]   And so none of these things are bad things.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.480]   The Bible tells us that those things ought to be our characters, those things ought to
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.360]   be things that we practice.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.320]   But that is not the central purpose of the church.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:34.720]   Chuck Colson in his book, The Church, he writes of a story of this church in the South where
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.000]   it's a tiny church, they wanted to help for social causes and there was this lady who
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.520]   was really good at fried chicken.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.820]   And so she started cooking fried chicken, they started raising a lot of money and everybody
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.700]   around town started to hear about her fried chicken.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.960]   And so the fried chicken became the central thing at this church.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.160]   The people outside the church would come and buy this fried chicken, but at the same time,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.060]   the core things of the church, preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible and fellowship
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.960]   in Christ started getting neglected and this fried chicken started to really take off.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.760]   And they were doing good things with this money, helping the poor.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:15.400]   And he talks about how this church eventually drifted away, ended up shutting down the church
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.040]   and establishing a fried chicken business.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:26.760]   A church that forgets why we are gathered together becomes nothing more than a social
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.280]   gathering.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.240]   And sometimes we're not even aware of it until we start having relational problems
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.720]   and then the church has no longer any meaning.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.600]   That's why the communion table has been given to us so that we do not drift.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.480]   So that we would always focus on Christ.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.640]   The reason why you and I are gathered together is because He is our salvation.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.160]   That's what the communion table is to remind us of.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.960]   Secondly, the Passover served to remind Israel of God's care and deliverance during times
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   of hardship.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.200]   He says in Deuteronomy 7.17, "If you should say in your heart, 'These nations are greater
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.760]   than I,' how can I dispossess them?
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.960]   You shall not be afraid of them.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.760]   You shall well remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt."
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.680]   He says, as you wander in the desert, as you get into the promised land, there's going
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.800]   to be nations that are much more fortified and stronger.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.600]   You're going to experience some hunger.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.760]   You're going to experience some thirsting.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.160]   You're going to experience trials and maybe some of it that you're not even going to understand.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.680]   But during those periods, remember that God delivered you.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.320]   God is your deliverance.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.440]   He saved you, so He's also going to sustain you.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.880]   And so that's what the Passover, not only to remember what He did in the past, but because
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.960]   of what He has done in the past, how will He not, who saved you from all of that, not
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.760]   sustain you, just kind of send you out into the wilderness and say, "Good luck.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.760]   Hope you make it."
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.920]   And it's to remind them that their strength is in God.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   As long as they're in God, they are safe.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.560]   That's what it was supposed to remind them every year at the Passover meal.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.060]   And in the same way, it says in Romans 8.31-35, Apostle Paul says, "What then shall we say
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.180]   to these things?
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.200]   If God is for us, who is against us?
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.520]   He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us, so how will He not also with
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.200]   Him freely give us all things?"
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.400]   That's exactly what the Passover meal was for.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:29.520]   If He delivered you, if He cared for you enough to deliver you, why would He not sustain you
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.000]   on the path to the promised land?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   If we truly believe that He loved us enough to send His only begotten Son.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.400]   It is illogical.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:49.000]   It is inconsistent to believe in a God who would send His only begotten Son and then
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.480]   question what God is going to take care of us financially.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.240]   Whether we're going to stay healthy or not, or worried about the future.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.160]   Now, obviously, we're human beings, so as long as we live on this earth, there's going
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.320]   to be things that concern us.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.000]   But in the big scheme of things, we're to constantly remember the communion table that
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.960]   not only has He justified us, it is by His mercy we are sanctified.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.080]   So there is nothing that's going to happen in our life that doesn't come through a sovereign
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.800]   and loving hand.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.880]   So whatever pain that we experience, whatever things that we cannot understand, once we
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.200]   understand that God is in the midst of this, all of a sudden, it's okay.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.080]   We can experience pain, but if that pain is coming from somebody who's trying to hurt
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:45.640]   us versus a doctor who's giving surgery and this pain is going to lead to fixing the problem
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.280]   that we came in with, those two different pains have a completely different purpose.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.320]   How we approach it is completely different.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.600]   So in our Christian life, there may be things that come in where we need sustenance, we
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.200]   need guidance.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.360]   Before we run to counselors, before we run to friendship, before we run to community,
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:11.080]   that we come to the communion table and remember, He who did not spare even His own Son to deliver
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.840]   us, how will He not, along with Him, give us all things that are necessary?
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.600]   Sometimes even pain.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.320]   Sometimes even pain is given to us for our good.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.760]   That's what the Passover was to remind us of.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.080]   God is with us.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.160]   He's in our midst.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.200]   2nd part of Romans 8, again 33 says, "Will He bring a charge against God's elect?
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.480]   God is the one who justifies.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.640]   Who is the one who condemns?
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.480]   Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.200]   Who is at the right hand of God?
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.680]   Who also intercedes for us?
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.600]   Who will separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.360]   Will tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness, peril or sword?"
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.020]   In other words, nothing.
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.280]   Because He justified us, He will sustain us.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.420]   That's what that means.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.240]   He doesn't justify us and then He sends you off and is like, "Try hard to be sanctified
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.840]   and see if you can make it."
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:10.960]   He said, "No, if He justified us, He will sanctify us and then He will eventually glorify
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.960]   us."
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.440]   That's what the communion table teaches us.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.880]   It's not just in the beginning.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:21.280]   Our very practical needs today, there's a tendency to think the church is good for religious
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.320]   stuff.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.760]   When I want to think about eternity, when I want to talk about evangelism, then the
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.920]   church is necessary.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:36.840]   To pay my bills, raising children, retirement, these are things that I need to do.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.040]   I need to be good at it.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.600]   Sometimes again, that causes us to get into trouble and that's what the communion table
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.440]   is, past and present.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:54.000]   But the third reason I think is the most relevant to us for the Passover.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:02.120]   Because when trials and hardship comes, if you are a genuine believer, it causes us to
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.520]   be desperate and to cling to God.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.400]   So when persecution comes, it almost always leads to the purification of the church.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:16.200]   I was reading this week that because of the pandemic and so many people who've been online
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.520]   and not physically at church, as an ability to be fellowship, participate in Bible study,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:28.280]   the surprising number of people who fell away from church, they said 50%.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.000]   So we have no idea when all the churches open, what the church is going to look like, because
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.760]   at least on paper, their survey, 50%.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.880]   Out of the 50%, some of them have gone for good.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   Out of the 50%, some of them have moved churches.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.960]   Some of them are in between churches.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:51.640]   The 50% is, if you take the totality of the churches, that the people who used to be at
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.800]   that church, 50% are no longer at that church.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.480]   Now we may be shocked by that and say, "Well, I mean, we had hardship and it's actually
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   destroying the church."
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.200]   No, that's not destroying the church.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.600]   In fact, you know, when I talked to the Indian pastors, they said, "With all the persecution
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.720]   that's coming and literally they don't know if they're going to walk into the village,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.640]   if they're going to get stoned or not, how does that affect you guys?"
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.240]   And he said, "It's been good because it purified the church.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.320]   Only real Christians come now."
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.680]   And so he said, "It's bringing revival."
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   And so the few who are genuinely walking with God are more fervent in their faith.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   They share more boldly.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.520]   So persecution is not what worries the church.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.480]   If our end goal is not safety.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.280]   If your end goal is safety, if your end goal is to live a good life where your children
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.120]   are raised in a godly home, go to a good church, go to VPS, and then they live a peaceful,
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.280]   comfortable life until they're 80, and then they live...
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.400]   If that's your goal, yes, persecution is going to disturb that.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.280]   Before end goal is to glorify God and to share the gospel, persecution is actually good.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.120]   The challenge and the struggle is actually good for us than to live in peace.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:16.520]   Our problem is not persecution, it's in times of peace when we don't feel pressure.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.560]   And our natural tendency is we want to live where there is good neighborhood, where we
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   don't have to worry about our children.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.860]   Of course, what parent wouldn't?
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:31.560]   But our natural tendency to live in comfort is what causes us to drift.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.960]   When the storm comes, everybody anchors because they see the danger.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.080]   Because if you're not anchored when the storm comes, I mean, you can literally die.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.180]   But we don't drift during the storm.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.200]   We drift when we don't see the danger.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.120]   And that's what he says in Deuteronomy 8, 11.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.920]   "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments and His
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.200]   ordinances and His statutes, which I am commanding you today.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.000]   Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied and have built good houses and lived in them,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.160]   and when your herds of your flocks multiply and your silver and gold multiply, and all
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.200]   that you have multiplies, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.720]   Lord and your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery."
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:20.360]   17, "Otherwise, you may say in your heart, 'My power and the strength of my hand made
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.320]   me this wealth.'
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.640]   But you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He," look at how many times he says
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   "He."
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.120]   "It is He who is giving you the power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.080]   He swore to your fathers, and it is this day."
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.280]   So that was the problem.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.240]   The main problem of the Israelites was not when the enemies were coming.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.480]   It wasn't the Midianites.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.520]   It wasn't the Philistines.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.560]   It wasn't the Egyptians.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:58.160]   It was when they were financially stable, when the temple was being used at full force,
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.940]   when everything was being done, and they were following the command, the letter of the law.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.840]   And yet God says, "None of that is for me."
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.780]   Your singing has become a burden.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.280]   Your assembly is evil.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.940]   He said, "Even the music, the instruments that you play," He said, "has become noise
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   to me."
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:22.840]   Hosea 13, 5-6, "I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of the drought.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   As they had their pasture, they became satisfied; and being satisfied, their heart became proud.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.460]   Therefore they forgot me."
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:43.040]   If you look in the book of Judges, right before revival, there's judgment because they forgot
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.440]   God.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.920]   So when they were in the greatest danger was not when the judgment was there, was not when
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   the enemies were attacking.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.560]   Because when the enemies started to attack, that's when they cried out to God.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:00.240]   God had mercy and would raise up a judge and through the judge overthrow their enemies,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.780]   and then they would celebrate.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.720]   And after they celebrated, they became satisfied.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   And once they became satisfied, they became proud and they forgot God.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:15.320]   So the most dangerous period in Israel's cycle is when they were at peace.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.000]   Because next step is they forgot God.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.040]   They became proud and they forgot God.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.420]   Because when we are doing well, our bills are paid, and things are going well, our natural
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.080]   tendency is I made a good judgment, I bought the house at the right time, I sold it at
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.040]   the right time, I put my money at game stop when it was $6, and so therefore if I find
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.840]   two more of these, I can retire by the time I'm 35.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.560]   And when things are going well, that's when we need to be careful.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.520]   Be careful when you think you stand, because that's when you will fall.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:54.200]   See, the communion, the Passover meal was given to us even in times of peace to humble
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.600]   us when we come before.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.800]   Every time we come to the communion table is to remind us, you did not get here on your
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.000]   own.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.020]   You did not come to the table because you were good this week.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.520]   And you cannot resist the table because you were bad.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:16.160]   The communion table humbles Nicodemus and it raises the Samaritan woman.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.760]   Because the path to Christ is the same.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.000]   It humbles the proud and it lifts up the humble.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.760]   That's what the communion table does.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.080]   And so we are to remember this.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.800]   And that's why we participate in this communion, because once we forget that, what it symbolizes,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:38.720]   what it was supposed to remind us, and the moment we start to drift, we rely on our own
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.320]   resources, we are satisfied where we are at, and we're no longer desperate.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.000]   And again, when we are the most in danger is when we don't feel this desperateness for
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.080]   Christ.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:57.360]   Because our bills are paid, our children are doing well, you have enough money in the retirement,
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.760]   all these things that make you a good father, good mother.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.640]   And when you begin to take a step back and say, "Wow, I've done my job," he says, "Watch
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   out."
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:12.240]   Because the communion table is to remind us of our constant need for Christ.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:18.040]   So after saying that, I said, "Well, if you believe in this symbolism, why do we take
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.000]   this so seriously if it's just a symbol?"
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.400]   One, like I said, because it is an ordinance.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.000]   It is law.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.280]   This was not suggested.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.440]   It was commanded in Scripture.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.000]   So we're going to practice it.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.240]   But there are a few names that different denominations, different groups, and even within the same
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.440]   church we may use different names, and it conveys some of the things that the Bible
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.120]   teaches why we should take this seriously.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.040]   We've already talked about ordinance.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.760]   It's commanded, right?
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   This is not a suggestion that every church that is obedient is to practice this.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:59.960]   That's why the parachurches, we don't call them churches, because one of the key factors
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.520]   of what a church is is to practice the ordinance.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.600]   You can't say, "We're not a local church, so we don't practice it."
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.000]   Well, that's not a suggestion.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.160]   It was commanded in Scripture, right?
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.120]   That's a side thing.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.160]   Another word that is used is sacrament.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.360]   We don't normally use the word sacrament because there's historical connotations attached
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.040]   to that in the Catholic Church.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.840]   But the meaning behind it is something that we need to understand.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.800]   Sacrament basically means sacred or set apart.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.200]   Just like when the priests were entering into the Holy of Holies, there was a degree of
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.280]   seriousness that they were to take when they went into the Holy of Holies.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:43.600]   Jesus was angered because the Jews were doing selling of other products and animals and
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.320]   making profit out the outer court where it was supposed to be a place of worship.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:55.360]   And that's why Jesus says He will be consumed with His Father's house, that it ought to
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.160]   be a place of worship, of prayer.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.040]   And so that's what the word sacred means.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   Now, though it is symbolic and it is a memorial, it is to be taken seriously, just like with
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.400]   the baptism.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.720]   We don't just do it because that's what we think or I believe.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.720]   That's what I was taught.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   What is the tradition?
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.400]   That we do not turn from it to the left or to the right because it is an ordinance commanded
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   in Scripture.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:29.280]   In fact, it is so sacred in 1 Corinthians 11, 27, 28, some people were actually dying
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.040]   because they were disrespecting the communion table.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.360]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.560]   shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.800]   In other words, you're taking something that is so sacred and you're treating it like it's
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.580]   very trivial.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.920]   And so what was happening at Corinth, they were coming together and the rich people were
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.240]   eating and the poor people would not eat.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.720]   And so by doing that, causing division, right?
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.040]   If you have, you're going to get together.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.280]   So they weren't acknowledging that the communion table itself and so they were participating
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.880]   in an unworthy manner.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:07.600]   And because God wanted to teach the early church the significance of this ordinance,
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.460]   the consequence of that was some of them were actually dying from this.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.480]   And so though we may not experience that, right?
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.340]   But the point that God was trying to make in the Corinthian church of the sacredness
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:25.160]   of this event, we ought to take seriously because it is meant to be sacred, it is meant
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:31.780]   to be law, that we ought to practice it exactly the way or the way that honors God, that lends
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.920]   to the weightiness of what it is that we are doing.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.640]   The other word that we use in our church that we use commonly is the word communion.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.400]   The word communion literally is koinonia, fellowship, to partner.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.200]   And so the significance behind that is that the communion was to bring the church together,
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.320]   that this is what binds us together.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.320]   So communion was never meant to be done in private.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.200]   It is not an event between you and God.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.360]   It was meant to be done in the context of the body of Christ.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:05.640]   And this is the reason why we do not practice communion at home, because it is to be done
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.800]   at the presence of the whole church.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:14.000]   And we do not practice communion at the wedding, because the wedding is not a gathering of
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   the whole church.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.280]   It is a segment of the church, it is not a gathering of the whole church.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.880]   And so we practice communion when the physical body of Christ is gathered together.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.720]   So I know that at the beginning of the pandemic, we were discussing about how come we do not
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.920]   let the people who are at home participate in the communion.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.760]   And again, as much as we would like to, we do not want to give disinformation about what
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.680]   the communion is.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:43.040]   Communion was meant for the physical gathering of the church, not to be done privately between
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.040]   me and God.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:52.360]   And that is why a long time ago, understanding this, we used to practice communion with the
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:57.880]   Hawaiian bread, because that is kind of like the way I learned it.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.640]   And so the Hawaiian bread basically means it is one body and everybody participating
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.680]   in one body.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.760]   And so the way I learned it when I was young, again like I said, I was never taught this
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.320]   at seminary.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.800]   So as I was practicing communion, I was just kind of going off of my memory as a youth
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.640]   student, what my youth pastor did.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.240]   And so I remember going up to retreats and he would pass around Hawaiian bread.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.800]   And if he did not have one loaf, it would be just coming in that bag.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.560]   And then we would take pieces.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.800]   And then we did not have little cups, so he would give us the grape juice boxes.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.920]   So we would have a box of that, right, or a cup, but we would have something with the
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.960]   juice and then Hawaiian bread.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.600]   And then we would eat it.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   And that would be our communion.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.320]   And after we were finished, we would bring salami, because salami tastes really good
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   with that bread.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:52.840]   And then we would drink the rest of the grape juice and we would have lunch, right.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:59.560]   So earlier part of the church, we kind of had a version of that at church, right.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.960]   And I know this is sacred, but that is kind of what I remember.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.760]   So I remember the first three, four years of the church, we would have the Hawaiian
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   bread.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   And then we would practice.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.800]   I would pour the grape juice in a big bowl and then take the Hawaiian bread from one
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.360]   loaf and then dip it and then eat it and then go.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.400]   Like that was what we were practicing.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.600]   And then after we're done, whatever's left over, we would drink and get salami and then
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   eat it.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   So we were doing that.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.520]   And then we had a brother who came to church and he was fairly new.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.160]   And then he started practicing communion.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.800]   And he wasn't upset or anything.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   He just kind of passionately said, you know, he saw us like taking the bread and everybody
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.680]   was tearing it to pieces and eating it.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.200]   It's like, "That kind of seems sacrilegious.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.560]   Should we be doing that?"
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.800]   And then, you know, I just heard it in passing.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.400]   And I said, "Oh, we do that because, you know, it's one loaf, one bread and we're doing all
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   that."
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   And then I went home.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.560]   I was like, "Yeah, that doesn't seem right.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.440]   This is after years of doing this.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.440]   Maybe we shouldn't do that."
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.920]   And so I had a meeting with our leadership.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.320]   It's like, "Maybe we shouldn't be doing that."
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.000]   And then we started thinking like, "It's supposed to be unleavened bread.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.120]   That's very, you know, sweet.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.840]   Maybe we shouldn't be doing that."
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.440]   And then the wine part of it that, you know, we said, "Oh, we just stopped that because
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   it was unsanitary."
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.780]   So we found cops and we started doing it differently.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.360]   So we started kind of like, "What is the best way?
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.440]   What is the best way for us to signify what it means and convey the meaning of significance?"
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.440]   Right?
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:35.000]   And so that's why when we started practicing the communion, we want to make sure that we
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.840]   handle it with sacredness.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.480]   So every once in a while, somebody would see us stumbling up here, putting it together
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.480]   and throwing it away.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.840]   And somebody would say, "Hey, do you guys need some help?"
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.480]   And you probably had to say, "Oh, we don't need your help," even though we're fumbling.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   Right?
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.920]   A part of the reason why is because we wanted to convey the sacredness of what it is that
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.920]   we are handling.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.840]   That this is not just some bread.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.480]   Even though it is symbolic, it's not just bread.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.440]   It's not some grape juice.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.880]   That this is sacred enough that God has separated this as an ordinance, a command for the church
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.520]   to practice.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:13.040]   And so even this, you know, like this existed a long time ago, you know, and there was some
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.440]   talk about, "Hey, why don't we do this?"
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.120]   And it'd be so much easier than to set it up.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.160]   We just buy this and put it on the thing, just throw it away.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.480]   We'll be done with it.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.980]   Obviously, we introduced this because we're in a pandemic.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.480]   And so we're trying to be sanitary.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.600]   But once this is done, you know, we choose not to practice it this way because of the
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.440]   meaning behind it.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   We want the church to understand that the body of Christ is coming together.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.680]   We're handling the body of Christ and the blood of Christ symbolically.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   Right?
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.920]   Same thing with baptism.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.160]   The baptism signifies a death and resurrection.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.240]   So we practice immersion as the Bible teaches.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.000]   So once we are done with the pandemic, we're going to go back to that.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.520]   But we want to make sure that everybody understands that that's exactly what we're doing.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.520]   Right?
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.560]   To remember Christ's sacrifice, that He's sustaining us, that this is an ordinance,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.000]   that this is a sacrament.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.360]   This is a communion to remind us that we are one together.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:11.200]   That's why before we participate in communion, we ask you to think, "Are there relationships
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.120]   that have been broken that you need to confess?"
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.840]   You know, and obviously, it's hard to practice that perfectly.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.000]   But are there things that you're holding in your heart that you need to confess and reconcile
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   in the body of Christ?
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Right?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Are we acknowledging the body of Christ or have we drifted away from the church and we're
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.160]   no longer participating?
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:36.000]   And to remind us that this is supposed to galvanize us together, the body of Christ.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.520]   Another word that is used is "Eucharist."
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.800]   Sometimes the Lutheran church uses this term, but the meaning behind "Eucharist" basically
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.880]   is good grace.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.360]   That's where we get the word "thanksgiving."
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   Right?
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.720]   It's a table of celebration to give thanks.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   Right?
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.480]   Maybe you come in and there's things that you're not happy about.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.680]   You've been grumbling this week or last week, and there's a lot of things, and you have
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.460]   a tendency to articulate things that you're frustrated, and I catch myself doing that
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.080]   all the time.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.920]   And so at the communion table, it is a place to celebrate, right?
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:16.680]   In light of what he has given me and recalibrate my thoughts, my heart.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.360]   I have way more things to be thankful for than to be concerned about.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.540]   Way more things to praise him for than to complain about.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.680]   And so that's what the Eucharist is meant to be.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.880]   And then the last one, again, this is a term that we often use as well, "the Lord's table."
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.880]   Right?
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.560]   It's meant to be a celebration, to remind us, ultimately pointing to the second coming
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.300]   of Christ.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.520]   The Bible says in Revelations 19, 7-9, "Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.780]   to him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:55.400]   It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean, for the fine linen
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.180]   in the righteousness, righteous acts of the saints.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:02.160]   Then he said to me, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   Lamb.'
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.760]   And he said to me, 'These are true words of God.'"
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.600]   So this communion table, the Lord's Supper, is to remind us, not only did he die for us,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.880]   but because he died for us, he's going to take us into eternity.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:22.100]   And in eternity, we're going to be celebrating in his marriage ceremony.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.800]   He's the groom and we are the bride, and we're going to participate in this joyous wedding.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:33.040]   People ask me all the time, because I told you the first wedding that I did, since then
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.400]   I've counted about a hundred.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.100]   My guess is about a hundred to 120 weddings.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.040]   And people ask me, "Doesn't it get old?
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.020]   You go to so many weddings, you do the same thing every time."
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:50.760]   My honest, honest answer, it does not.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.320]   It does not get old, even though it looks the same, and sometimes you might hear the
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.500]   sermon and you say, "Oh, I heard that."
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:03.120]   And I know I'm preaching to the same people a hundred times, so I'm aware of the pressure.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.000]   So I'm not dumb.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.200]   So it gets harder and harder as it goes.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.040]   But wedding ceremony never gets old because it's the beginning of two people starting
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.160]   a new life.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.840]   Disneyland is not the happiest place in the world.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.280]   I think the wedding banquet is the happiest place in the world, where everybody's excited
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.240]   to see these young couple celebrate the beginning of a new life.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.600]   They get to go home with their best friend.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.280]   And to be able to be a part of that and be a part of that ceremony, that part never gets
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   old.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.480]   I never come back from a wedding depressed.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.480]   So the communion table is to remind us of the real celebration.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.440]   All of that to point to the celebration of the coming of Christ.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.460]   And so that's why we want to lift up the communion, that we understand as a church,
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:56.400]   not just the pastors, not just the leaders who make decisions, but the church understands
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.880]   what it is that we are doing.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.220]   Remember who saved us.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.520]   Remember in times of hardship, remember when things are well, that God had given us this
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.680]   ordinance not simply to go through the motion and say we did it, but to remember him and
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.480]   to celebrate him and eagerly anticipate.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:21.320]   So those of you who are not doing well, by the grace of God, participate.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.840]   Where those of you who are filled with pride thinking that you're going to come here because
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:29.200]   you've been good, to be humbled when you come to the communion table.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.680]   And for all of us to eagerly anticipate, no matter what's going on now, we're just passing
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.120]   through.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.860]   We're just passing through.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.120]   This is temporary.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:43.120]   Our eternity is coming and we're going to be at the wedding together with Christ.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:43.980]   Okay.
