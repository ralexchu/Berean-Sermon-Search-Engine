[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   So the text that we're going to be looking at today is in Revelation chapter 1 verse
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:17.040]   9 through 20 and it's the beginning or the commissioning of Apostle John so that he sees
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.240]   the vision, he encounters the glorified Christ and then the vision that he sees he is commanded
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.800]   to go and teach to the six or seven churches.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.680]   So we're going to be looking at that this afternoon.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680]   Let me pray first and then we jump in.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:44.080]   Gracious Father, we thank you for answering our prayers and we thank you Father God for
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.920]   guiding our steps and at times our hearts become anxious Lord God because we don't know
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.960]   what's coming.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.360]   We look at our present circumstance and it's not exactly where we would like to be.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.760]   So we pray Father God that as we continue to walk with you that every day and everything
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.200]   that we experience and as you continue to answer our prayers and reveal to us that you
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.820]   are concerned for us and that you have our well-being in your mind that you would continue
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.160]   to cause your church to grow.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.920]   As we are exposed to your word that we would have continued confirmation Lord God that
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.000]   you are truly Lord, that you are sovereign, that everything that you've promised and everything
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.240]   that we study in this book that one day will come true and that we would have that solid
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.040]   assurance Lord God to build our lives and our future in Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   Amen.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.080]   All right so we're going to start looking at the beginning Revelation chapter 1 verses
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.080]   9 through 20.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.360]   We're going to look at the first few verses.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.440]   The first section where John, okay John who's the recipient of the vision and we're going
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.600]   to look at that in verse 1 and starts by saying John your brother partner in the tribulation
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.200]   and so God gives this vision to John in order that he may be prepared.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.480]   So basically the first section begins with John being called and revealing his glory
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.640]   and his vision to him so that he can convey it to the church.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.240]   So God gave this vision and glory and this is very similar to what you'll see and again
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.760]   I'm for the sake of time I'm not going to turn there but Isaiah, Ezekiel and the book
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.520]   of Daniel and we can give countless other examples but every time God wants to use somebody
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.360]   to represent him he basically reveals himself in a greater light and the purpose of that
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.840]   obviously is so that he can be his messenger and so we see that with his disciples where
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   before he sends them out he doesn't sit there and say here's some instructions and I want
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   you to regurgitate what I have to say.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640]   He spent allows him to spend a significant amount of time walking with him, watching
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.440]   him, knowing him because their calling wasn't simply to say here's the gospel information
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   that I have for you and it is no different for us that our calling in life isn't to regurgitate
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.480]   information that we know about Jesus.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.080]   It is very ineffective so if you've ever tried to share the gospel with somebody here's a
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.160]   bunch of facts that I know that I believe in and I hope that one day you'll believe
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.840]   these bunch of facts.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   The gospel was never meant to be transferred from fact to fact, from person to person that
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   way, from in a classroom.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.680]   It was always meant to be as a form of testimony.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.840]   That's why we call it witnessing, that we witness something and then we convey what
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   we witness to the other person and so that's the pattern that we see in the scripture.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   He is about to give this revelation to the church and obviously to all of us but in order
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.280]   to do that he prepares him.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.160]   He does that, we see that in the book of Isaiah chapter 6, Ezekiel chapter 1 and we're going
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.760]   to refer back to Daniel's prophecies over and over again as we're studying Revelation
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.600]   and we see the same pattern with Daniel.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.720]   That God first reveals himself to Daniel before he gives his prophecies.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.120]   We know that John had intimate knowledge of these churches and why I say that is because
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.480]   he calls them partner, he calls them partner in tribulation and in kingdom and patient
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   endurance.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.880]   So we're going to take a look at that.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.200]   So John is not writing this letter to seven churches that he doesn't know.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   He's very intimate and he knows their faults, he knows their strengths and especially the
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   church of Ephesus.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.080]   He probably has a lot of interaction with the other churches because he spent so much
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.200]   time in the church of Ephesus, most likely he spent a lot of time with these other churches
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.520]   too.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.160]   So John is not taking this message and sending it to a group of people he doesn't know.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   He knows them very well, he knows that they're in the midst of intense suffering and that's
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.080]   why he's writing to them and he says, "I'm suffering with you.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.360]   I'm not just saying these things and saying, 'Hey, you should suck it up because Jesus
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   is coming.'
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.840]   He said, 'I'm in the same boat as you and the same things that are encouraging me will
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.520]   also encourage you.'"
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.440]   We're told that he's at the island of Patmos and he said it's an account of his word, meaning
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.000]   specifically in the context of him suffering.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.120]   I think I have some pictures.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.920]   This island of Patmos was used by the Romans for political prisoners.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.720]   So there was a small group of people that already lived in that island but for the most
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.880]   part it was a pretty desolate area, not a lot of vegetation.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.760]   In fact, I have some pictures.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.040]   So just for your information where Patmos is.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   So does this have a laser?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   Pastor Mark, does this have a laser?
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   Am I too far?
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.720]   Oh, there it is.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.320]   So there's the island of Patmos.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   This is Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Lathaiatira, Sardis.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.280]   So you'll see that all the seven churches are located right in this area.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.520]   And this is Asia Minor.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.680]   This whole area is Asia Minor.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.000]   Apostle Paul begins his ministry somewhere over here in Antioch.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.760]   His first missionary journey is limited to right in this section.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.200]   Second missionary journey, he comes here and then he tries to venture out and he comes
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.560]   all the way out here.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.040]   And then he wanted to go to Asia Minor but the Holy Spirit tells him not to go.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   He wants to go to Bithynia.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.320]   The Holy Spirit tells him not to go and then he crosses over to Philippi and then he begins
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.240]   to do ministry over here.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.360]   So John, sorry I got John and Paul mixed up.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.040]   John was very familiar with these churches.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.520]   So what he's writing to them is not, he's not writing as a third person.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.400]   He's writing because he's very intimate.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.880]   He knows this church very well.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   Okay.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.200]   This is an actual picture of the island itself.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.960]   And obviously this is a portion of it.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.600]   This is not what it looks like everywhere.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.040]   Obviously there are people, there are villages there now but this is probably a lot closer
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:24.800]   to what it may have looked like for John when he was on this island.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.140]   The context of the vision.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.760]   It says that John was in the Spirit.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.560]   Okay.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   So John was in the Spirit.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.720]   Now all of your Bibles probably have that capitalized as the capital S.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.320]   Now there's a debate as to what that means.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.920]   Is he talking about that he was filled with the Holy Spirit or the Holy Spirit was the
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.960]   one who was kind of like put him in a trance and he was speaking to him directly?
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.280]   We don't know for sure what exactly that means but we do know that there is a pattern again
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.940]   where God shows himself and it says in each one of these instances where Peter or Paul,
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.200]   they also encounter Christ.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.400]   They tell us again in Acts chapter 10, 10-11 that he became hungry.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.840]   Talking about Peter when he has this vision of Jesus telling him not to call the Gentiles
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   unclean.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.140]   If God calls them clean, that you should consider them clean.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:35.200]   But here we can see that he fell into a trance.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.720]   Now again we don't know exactly what that trance is.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   When I used to be a part of the charismatic group, I thought I knew for sure what that
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   was.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.440]   And it could be, it could be kind of like you're not asleep, you're not awake, it's
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.600]   kind of in the middle ground somewhere.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.680]   But again that's all conjecture, we don't know that for sure.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.040]   And we see that Apostle Paul, same thing, when Jesus speaks to him, he said when I had
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.360]   returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple I fell into a trance.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.000]   And so most commentators believe that John also was in that kind of a state where visions
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.960]   were given to him so he wasn't necessarily awake like we are awake now, and he wasn't
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.040]   necessarily asleep like we would normally sleep, but he was somewhere in between.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.840]   Now we don't know, we can conjecture and add stuff and say this is what it was, but again
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.920]   that's all just our opinion, our guess.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.140]   We don't know exactly for sure.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:35.400]   But that's the context in which John receives, and he said that he received this on the Lord's
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.320]   Day, and the reason why this is significant is because the Lord's Day is most likely in
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.800]   reference to the first day of the week, Sunday.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.220]   Now why is this significant?
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:59.800]   Why is it significant and why are we spending time talking about the Lord's Day?
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.880]   When was the Lord's Day for the Christians?
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.160]   It was Sunday, right?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.120]   They called, the early church began to call the day that they were worshiping God on Sunday
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.800]   the Lord's Day.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.480]   They worshipped on Sabbath for 1500 years.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.400]   And again it's not like today.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.280]   Today we have one worship on Sunday and we have a lot of churches that don't do it on
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280]   Sunday.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.400]   We have Wednesday, Saturday, oh why do we have to do it on Sunday?
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.440]   And I know that some churches debate this issue, and maybe even within the church.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.320]   It's like well let's not be legalistic, you know, like missing church every once in a
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.720]   while is not that big of a deal.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.600]   And I know we have kind of a nonchalant attitude toward corporate worship, at least in our
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.720]   generation.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:50.160]   You have to remember that the Jews for 1500 years, what happened when they blasphemed
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.720]   or they didn't observe the Sabbath?
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.640]   They were more than exiled.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.280]   They were taken out of the city and they were stoned.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.720]   It was a very serious offense.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.800]   So they took this very, very seriously.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.840]   So remember when Jesus was performing miracles, right?
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.820]   Remember in John chapter 5, he heals a man, you know, and his great miracle took place
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.360]   and everybody sees this and then the Jews get angry because of what?
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.600]   Because it happened on a Sabbath.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.160]   They were so committed to the Sabbath that even after seeing a miracle, a man who was
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.600]   obviously lame, and even they acknowledge this, clearly a miracle took place, but they
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.760]   become angry at Jesus.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.500]   How can this be a man of God if he breaks the Sabbath?
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.680]   So they decided that he must not be from God.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.280]   If he's a man of God, he has to keep the Sabbath.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.120]   So if you read the New Testament, if you read the Gospel, you can see just how important
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   the Sabbath is.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.280]   So, you know, one of the things that we say that as evidence that something very, very
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:07.560]   drastic, spectacular must have happened in order for the early Jews to begin, even just
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.080]   to begin to worship on Sunday.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:16.180]   It may not sound like a big deal to us, but this is how they worship for 1500 years, right?
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.760]   And all of a sudden, the Lord's Day for them changed from Saturday to Sunday.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   And obviously the reason behind that is because that's the day that Jesus was resurrected,
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   right?
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.240]   Something drastic has to have happened for them to have changed that, right?
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.960]   And that, again, we believe is the resurrection.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.880]   I think it's significant here as well because when John is giving this revelation, we can
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:44.880]   already see the impact of the Gospel in the early church, even in the introduction.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.460]   The first thing that John hears, before he sees anything, he hears his voice.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:13:00.040]   And the voice is, what does the voice sound like?
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.120]   Trumpet, right?
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.520]   He turns around to hear this voice and it is not a quiet whisper, right, like Elijah.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.720]   He's sitting there and a gentle whisper comes and God speaks to different people in different
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   ways.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.880]   He speaks like a trumpet, like he said it sounded like a trumpet, right?
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.240]   Now was it an actual trumpet?
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   I don't think so.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.920]   He said it's like a trumpet, right?
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.360]   So what is the significance of him turning around and he hears Christ's voice?
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.840]   And he hears it like a trumpet.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.960]   So Jesus is somebody that he knew personally, walked with, slept with, ate with, right,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.920]   for more than two, three years.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.040]   But he turns around and he hears his master's voice, right?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:53.680]   In fact, John says of himself, the one that Jesus loved.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.860]   That's how he describes himself in the Gospels.
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.120]   So he had an intimate relationship with Christ, but when he turns around and he sees his resurrected
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   Christ, he's not seeing a friend.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   Not that he isn't a friend, not that he isn't somebody that he was very intimate with, but
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.680]   he sees a glorified Christ.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.840]   And so he hears his voice.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:26.800]   So if it is a trumpet, what was the trumpet blown for in Israel's history?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.920]   It could be war, right?
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.160]   Warning, some kind of declaration.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.160]   But it's definitely, you don't use a trumpet if you have something quiet to tell somebody.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.480]   Trumpet is not what you would use if you have something to tell and you don't want anybody
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.920]   else to hear it.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.100]   So the fact that John turns around and he hears his voice and his voice sounds like
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.440]   a trumpet, it immediately tells us this is something that needs to be declared.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.460]   And when you blow the trumpet in the context of war, it means it's something urgent.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:02.640]   That what he's about to show him and his calling to go and tell the people is very, very urgent,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.880]   right?
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.200]   Now we can look at that and say, well, we're 2,000 years removed from that, so it's no
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.540]   longer urgent to us.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:16.280]   This obviously was written for all of mankind, not only for the first century.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.860]   So the impact of us reading it and saying, well, he's blowing a trumpet, we should receive
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.720]   it with the same kind of impact that the early church had.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.040]   That what he's about to say in the book of Revelation requires careful attention because
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:36.080]   he's speaking to us with a sense of urgency.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.560]   The recipient of the letter, the seven churches, they're all about 50 miles apart, so these
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.840]   little tiny dots represent the churches, and they're all about 30 to 50 miles apart, so
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.760]   they're not too far away.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:58.000]   What would be about, like from here to LA, would that be about 50 miles?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.240]   About 30 miles would be from here to maybe Downey, Gwinnett Park?
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.120]   So it's not that far, even if they were walking, I mean, for that time.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:18.440]   So they're all about close proximity, and again, when he's commanded to write this and
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.460]   then take it to the churches, it was meant not only for one church, but they were to
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:28.420]   take his writing and go to each church and read it out loud for every church.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:34.060]   So the content of what he says, even though it says Church of Ephesus, Church of Smyrna,
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:39.520]   Church of Thyatira, those letters were not just meant for an individual church.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.040]   What he says to those individual churches may be relevant to that particular church,
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.000]   but the general content was meant to be read by every church.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.240]   There are certain things that he meant to say universally to everyone.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.120]   The order in which the churches are mentioned, again, we're going to get into a little bit
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.620]   more detail next week, so I'm not going to get into it too much today.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.080]   It goes right down this line, right?
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.880]   Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, so basically, you know, knowing that this is where the letters
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:17.900]   are going to go first, so most likely if one of John's disciples takes the letter, he would
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.620]   probably cross the sea right here and then stop by Ephesus and just make his way and
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.440]   just kind of travel this road, and that's why it's written in that order.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.240]   And next week, we're going to deal with the first four, and the week after that, we're
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:39.400]   going to deal with the second four, second three.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:49.380]   The vision itself, if you Google image of Jesus in Book of Revelations chapter one,
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.820]   there's so many scary images.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:18:00.640]   I chose the most acceptable one for the church.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.820]   I don't think I have, there's one with Jesus literally fire coming out of his eyes, double
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.060]   edged sword coming out of his mouth, but I chose the more tame one.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.820]   So the seven lampstands, Jesus standing in the midst, first thing that John sees is the
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.140]   golden lampstands.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:25.180]   These lampstands are not like the lampstands that they saw at the temple where you had
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:33.420]   kind of like the seven candles on one stick, but it's just seven separate lampstands.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.020]   So what is the significance of that?
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:45.420]   The very first vision that he sees is not of Christ, is not of all these other things.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.980]   First thing that he sees is the seven lampstands.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.980]   What is the seven lampstands?
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.340]   Later on it tells us.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.380]   It's the church.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:00.020]   So what do you think the significance is that John turns around and the first thing that
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:07.260]   Jesus shows him is the seven lampstands representing the church?
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.380]   The significance of the church, right?
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:16.260]   That Christ is very concerned about the church, right?
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.300]   He says he sees the lampstand and then the second thing that he sees is what?
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.100]   Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:30.000]   So the first image that John sees before Jesus shows him anything else is that these seven
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.500]   churches and Christ is in the midst of them and he's about to write a very intimate letter
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   to each one of them.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:41.980]   So everything that he has to say, not only from chapter three, we can kind of disconnect.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.900]   He writes the seven things to the church and then the rest of the book of Revelations up
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:53.020]   to chapter 22, we can study it as if it's not connected to the first three chapters,
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.180]   right?
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.620]   So we have to be careful to remember that everything that Jesus has to say in the 22
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.140]   chapters of the book of Revelation is directly related to what he says in the first three
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.340]   chapters to these churches, right?
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.940]   Because he says, "I want you to see this vision.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.820]   I want you to see that I'm genuinely concerned for them and I care for them and then tell
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.980]   them that these things are about to happen so that they may wake up.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.740]   If you are falling asleep, wake up.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.220]   If you lost your first love, repent.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.660]   Renew your first love.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.380]   If you're compromising in doctrine, if you're not careful, Christ is going to come and he's
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.700]   going to take away your lampstand."
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.020]   So everything that he says in this book is directly related to the seven churches that
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.100]   he's talking to.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.700]   Some churches have no particular issue and he's telling them to hang on.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.460]   Christ is coming, right?
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.100]   And you've been faithful to the end, stay to the end because Christ is coming and he's
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.500]   going to be victorious, right?
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.620]   So the first thing that he sees, again, the significance of that is it connects us to
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.420]   everything else that he has to say.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.740]   So when we're reading the book of Revelation, we have to read it like you're one of the
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.220]   seven churches, right?
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.340]   What does chapter 20 have to do with the church of Ephesus?
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:18.260]   How would a lukewarm church, a Laodicean church, how would they have read chapter 13, chapter
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.260]   15, right?
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.540]   And so you kind of have to see it in practical application because he wasn't just writing
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.540]   a bunch of mysterious things for the rest of the church to figure out for the next 2,000
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.540]   years.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.460]   It was a very personal letter to these seven churches where John says of himself that,
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.060]   "I'm a co-laborer.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.540]   I'm suffering along with you.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.740]   I'm also waiting patiently for him."
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.820]   And then the very first thing that he sees is Jesus standing in the midst of these seven
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.020]   churches concerned for them.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.460]   And he said, "What you have seen, take this to the seven churches."
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:59.500]   And then he says he sees the Son of Man standing in the midst of the seven churches, right?
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.940]   Or the seven lamb stands.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.100]   The term Son of Man is very significant.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:10.260]   It is the most favorite self-designated term that Jesus used of himself, right?
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.380]   He's called the Son of God, right?
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.700]   Sometimes prophet, Lord, master.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.540]   But the term Son of Man is the term that Jesus used most frequently of himself.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.420]   Now the term Son of Man generically, kind of like the term Son of God, generically can
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.060]   apply to the nation of Israel.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.220]   It could apply to children of God.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.700]   But the term specific Son of Man is related to the term that is used in Daniel chapter
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.700]   7, 13.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.700]   I don't know if I have that passage.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.700]   I don't.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.700]   Okay.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:48.860]   Can you turn your Bibles to Daniel chapter 7, 13 because this is very important and I
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.980]   want you guys to see the connection.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:58.500]   Turn to Daniel chapter 7, 13.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.860]   And I think I mentioned to you, I think the very first day that when you study the book
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.300]   of Revelation, a big chunk of some of the prophecies, you'll see the direct connection
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.500]   with the prophecies in the book of Daniel.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.340]   So this was not, a lot of these prophecies were not new.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.100]   It was a continuation or fulfillment in Christ.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.020]   So if you look at Daniel chapter 7, verse 13, Daniel sees a vision.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:26.180]   He says, "I saw in the night visions and behold with the clouds of heaven, there came one
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:31.300]   like a Son of Man and he came to the ancient of days and was presented before him and to
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.540]   him was given dominion, glory, kingdom that all people, nations, languages should serve
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   him.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.460]   His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom one that
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.740]   shall not be destroyed."
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:50.160]   So we see elements of this also in Hebrews chapter 1, describing Christ.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.740]   So clearly this is talking about the Messiah that's coming and this Messiah is not just
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.220]   a glorified human being because his kingdom will last forever.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.220]   It is eternal.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:05.180]   And all the nations, every single nation will bow before him.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.820]   So he's not just a glorified human being.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:22.020]   So Jesus uses that of himself, that title of himself more than any other title.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:39.540]   And you'll notice that when John sees Jesus, he says he sees one like a Son of Man.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:45.820]   Now why do you think he uses that term "like a Son of Man"?
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:54.860]   I talked about this a little bit last time.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.940]   How many times does he use the word "like"?
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.140]   Let's see.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:06.100]   Like the long robe, golden sash, his hair was of his head and was like wool, the word
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:12.100]   like flame, like furnished, like roar, right?
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.500]   Like did I miss any?
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.460]   So in all the descriptions of Christ, he uses the term "like."
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.100]   He's like this, he's like that, he's like this.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:26.780]   So when you Google Jesus' vision or John's vision of Jesus in Revelation chapter 1, if
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:32.380]   you were to draw him literally, I mean, it's a pretty scary picture, right?
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.140]   And you got a sword, double-edged sword coming out of his tongue.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:43.620]   He's got eyes of fire, hair like wool, white as wool, and all this stuff.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.780]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.260]   Why does he use the term "like"?
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:57.300]   He's seeing a vision, a glorified Christ that he may have seen a glimpse of maybe at the
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.580]   transfiguration, right?
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.540]   But again, that was only a glimpse, and this is before he was buried and resurrected.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.860]   So now in his full glorified, resurrected body, he's seeing Christ like he's never seen
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.060]   before.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:16.020]   So everything that he's seeing, is he actually seeing a sword coming out of his mouth?
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.900]   He said it's like a sword.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.900]   So we don't know.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.340]   Maybe it was a sword, maybe it wasn't a sword, we don't know.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:30.040]   But he's trying to do his best to describe the glory that now resides in Christ.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.060]   And so if you've never seen anything like that, he can say, "Well, I mean, Jesus, I've
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.900]   seen something like that.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.820]   Maybe the emperor of Rome, there's this majesty about him, and there's something about the
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.540]   beauty of that, or the power of the nuclear bomb."
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:52.980]   And you can kind of sense that, but if you've never really seen glory up close, how would
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.100]   you describe that?
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.220]   If you've ever traveled anywhere, and you've tasted a flavor that you've never experienced
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:07.180]   before, and you just loved it, you loved it, and you come back and you say, "Man, I went
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:13.180]   to India and I tasted this particular spice, and it was so delicious.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.180]   What is it like?"
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:23.540]   It was kind of like burrito and sushi and pizza.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.300]   The best hamburger you've ever tasted.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.060]   You say, "That's strange.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.060]   What is that like?
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.060]   That sounds disgusting."
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:36.660]   But you're trying to convey something that you've tasted that doesn't exist.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.860]   This is the first time you've tasted it, and you loved it.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.980]   So you're going to use language that's going to convey that this is what it was like.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.640]   It was kind of like this.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.060]   But I can't tell you it was like a burrito because it wasn't a burrito.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.660]   I can't tell you that it was like hamburger because there's nothing quite like it.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.620]   So the best that I can do is to give you an image of this is what I saw.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.220]   I saw the glorified Christ.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.460]   So everything that he sees is something that he can't explain with words.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.180]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.380]   And that's why he's saying "like."
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:16.700]   So we can draw a picture of him with the fiery eyes and all this stuff, but I don't think
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:29.020]   that's quite exactly what he saw.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:36.900]   I've already mentioned this, so I'll move on.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:42.680]   The next part is very important because he sees a vision of Christ, and it's not conveyed
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:56.860]   in one verse, but in totality what he sees, he's presented as Jesus, as prophet, priest,
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.860]   and king.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.020]   Remember Melchizedek?
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:12.060]   No king was ever allowed to give sacrifice, and only people who are in the line of Judah
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.140]   can be a king.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:20.180]   But Christ comes as a prophet, he's a priest, and he's a king.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.700]   And this is an office that only Christ can hold.
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.880]   This is unique to Christ that no other human being, no other king, no other prophet, no
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.760]   Levite has ever come close to, and they're not allowed to, because this is specifically
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   reserved for Christ.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.940]   So all those offices that was created and God used for a particular purpose in the nation
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.100]   of Israel, they are all types of Christ.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.860]   So if you look at the Levites and the things that he told them, all of that was to convey
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.380]   the office that Jesus was going to come and fulfill.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.940]   Every single king in the nation of Israel, they were sub-kings of the real king.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.620]   Remember why Saul got punished?
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.300]   Because Saul didn't recognize a king above him.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.220]   He thought he was the king of Israel, and he was punished for that.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.660]   So every king subsequent, after that, that they need to first and foremost recognize
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.560]   that they were simply servants of the real king, which was Christ.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.120]   So in this beginning picture of Christ, he's presented to us as a prophet who receives
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.600]   the revelation of God and to give to the servant through the angels.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.680]   He's the mediator between man and God.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:39.400]   He comes as a king who is exalted, sorry, prophet, and then he comes as a priest, finally.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:47.240]   In fact, the very first thing that is mentioned, Jesus is clothed in long robe and golden sash
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.040]   around his chest.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.320]   For the sake of time, we're not going to go there, but in Exodus 28 and 29, 5, that's
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.140]   the dress of a priest when he would come and serve.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:08.320]   So Jesus is wearing priestly garments.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.080]   Hair on his head were white like wool.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:17.280]   Let me go back real quick because the picture of Jesus mentioned here, "Son of man, he came
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.440]   the ancient of days and was presented to him."
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.440]   Okay, no, it's not this passage.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.440]   Is it?
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   No, no, it was a previous passage.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   Okay.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   All right, I'm going to go through this real quick because I'm not going to sit here and
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:48.960]   say the hair means this and feet means this and, you know.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.800]   I think we can guess when he says eyes of flame that he has piercing eyes, he sees all
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.080]   things, right?
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.480]   His feet were like burnished bronze refined in furnace ready for action.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.520]   He's got solid feet.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.920]   His voice like roar of many waters.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:16.400]   And again, that same description of Christ is given about God in Ezekiel 43 verse 2.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.440]   So all of these qualities that are describing Jesus is exactly the way God is described
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.200]   to us.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.360]   So if any Jehovah Witness comes to you and says, "Now, Jesus is not God.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   He's the Son of God."
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:38.320]   There are so many places in the Bible that can only refer to Jesus as God himself, right?
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:44.640]   Nobody who reads the Bible faithfully can come up and say Jesus never declared to be
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.260]   God, just the Son of God.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.560]   That is not the case, right?
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.040]   In his right hand, he held the seven stars.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.120]   See the seven stars here?
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.760]   I might have the one with the flaming eyes.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.240]   I might, maybe.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.640]   I forgot if I put it in here.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.360]   And those seven stars represents the angels.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.160]   And so each one of those angels, when he writes to the seven churches, he says to the angel
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.380]   of the church of Ephesus, the angel of the church of Smyrna.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.720]   So we're going to talk about that later when we get to that.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.740]   Okay, I'm not going to get too deep into that today.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.300]   From his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.000]   And obviously, you know, in Hebrews 4, it says the Word of God is sharper than any two-edged
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.460]   sword, double-edged sword.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.560]   So meaning that it's sharp, it can cut, right?
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.640]   It is very powerful.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:50.560]   His face was like the sun shining in full strength, again, to convey that he was seeing
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:34:07.920]   the glorified Christ.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.160]   John's response to this vision.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.240]   Yeah, this is the one.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.080]   But I hid his face.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.320]   If I lower him, you'll see his eyes of fire.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.600]   Okay.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:25.120]   John's response to the vision is the typical response that we see in any human being in
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.880]   the presence of God's glory.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.960]   He falls down in terror.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.520]   Now remember, he walked with Jesus.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.040]   He said of Jesus, "I'm the one that he favors and loves."
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   Right?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.560]   I mean, if anybody had an intimate relationship with Christ, it was John, and it's according
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.620]   to him.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.600]   But he sees the glorified Christ, and he's in terror.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   He's in fear.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.440]   He's never seen his master like this before.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.520]   Maybe at the transfiguration, he saw a glimpse of that.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.440]   Maybe after the resurrection, he saw his glorified body when Jesus came forward.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.680]   Remember, I think it was in Matthew chapter 28.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.740]   They all fall down and they worship him.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.040]   So they saw a glimpse of that, but nothing like this.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:17.280]   As soon as he confronted with that, he has a similar response of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:25.560]   every single person in the presence of his glory falls down in terror.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:32.760]   Now I think this is so crucial to a proper relationship with Christ.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.680]   Because we can have an intimate relationship with Christ, and we know that he loves us,
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   he cares for us, and all of these things are true.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.600]   But if we don't know that same God who terrifies sinners, then that grace isn't going to be
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.160]   a biblical grace.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.640]   It's going to be a grace that's created in our culture, kind of like grace like a generous
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   grandfather or grandmother that just kind of lets you get away with anything.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.960]   It's going to be a kind of grace where there is no punishment for sin.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.380]   God just kind of overlooks the things that we do.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:13.720]   So if we don't understand grace in the context of this terrified vision of Christ, and the
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:19.120]   only reason why John is able to have any kind of contact with Christ is what does Jesus
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   do?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:26.360]   Look at the text.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:35.240]   What does Jesus do?
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:40.280]   When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:48.040]   He was terrified, but laid his right hand on me saying, "Fear not."
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:55.680]   The only reason why John is able to even look up is because Jesus lays his hand in gentleness.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.440]   Even though he's in his full glory, he says, "Fear not.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.080]   I am the first and the last."
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.240]   So let me stop right here.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   Now he's trying to tell John not to fear.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.200]   You would think that he would say, "Don't fear.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.400]   I am gentle.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.280]   I'm not going to hurt you.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.920]   I am compassionate and loving.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.440]   I cover for your sins."
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:25.560]   Now all of these things are true, but he says, "Do not fear because I am almighty God."
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.200]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.780]   Do not fear.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.520]   I am the first and the last.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.120]   This is the same description of Yahweh.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.120]   Do not fear.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   I am God.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   Sorry.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.560]   I'll do it.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.800]   I am the living one.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.440]   I died and behold, I am alive forevermore.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.160]   I have the keys of death and Hades.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:38:01.200]   Isn't that the reason why he was fearing him in the first place?
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.000]   Wasn't that the reason why he saw the glorified Christ and said, "Oh my God, she's in his
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.120]   glory," and he's terrified and Jesus says, "Do not fear."
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:18.080]   What does all of this convey to John?
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.800]   Think about the big picture.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.200]   Why this letter is going out and who it's going out to.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:31.600]   In what context is this going out to?
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.560]   He's saying he's the almighty God.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.080]   I am the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.200]   I am the first and the last.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   I died.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.520]   I came back to life.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:48.640]   I have the power of death and hell.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.840]   How would you feel?
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.000]   Probably scared.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.800]   Right?
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:04.320]   But that God is on your side.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   As terrified as he may be, that's your God.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.560]   When he says, "I am the first and the last," he's not simply telling that to him.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:22.680]   He's conveying to him because his world has been flipped upside down.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:29.440]   We don't know for sure if he was actually put into boiling oil and then he survived.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.520]   We don't know that for sure, but we know for sure that all of his friends have already
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   died.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:39.920]   If not everybody, most of them have already been martyred by this time.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:46.120]   So John knows, he himself probably was thinking, "I'm ready to go myself," and he sees his
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.400]   brothers and sisters suffering in Christ in these churches and they're all terrified.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.960]   And we're not just talking about dying.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.680]   We're talking about a very painful death, some of them.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   Crucified, thrown into boiling oil, having lions and wild animals tear them apart.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.200]   They were torturing Christians.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.320]   And it's a horrific death.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.040]   So when Jesus tells John, "Do not fear because I am the first and the last.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.000]   I died and I was resurrected and I have the power to give life and I have the power of
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:28.320]   death and hell," all of this is conveyed to John that this Almighty God is on your side.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.560]   I am with you.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   I'm your master.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.160]   That master that you followed for three years was resurrected and you thought was being
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.600]   killed by the Romans.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.320]   Now he sees the glorified Christ.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.600]   This is who I am.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.680]   So can you imagine, John already probably knew this because he bowed down and worshipped
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:51.120]   him, but now he's meeting God himself, which he already conveyed.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:57.240]   He already bowed down and worshipped him, but now he's in the presence of his glory.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:02.320]   So can you imagine just being a part of the transfiguration, how that might have changed
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   the three of them?
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.880]   And how Peter talks about that later on, how he was there in the transfiguration.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.800]   So can you imagine if that had that kind of impact on them, that what kind of impact this
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.720]   would have had on John?
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.600]   I think his letters would have been affected by this.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.880]   His sermons probably would have been affected by this.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.400]   Every person that he met probably would have been affected by this.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.560]   How do you stand in the presence of the glory of this God that you've been worshipping,
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:39.280]   ancestors who created the universe, and then not have that as the center of your conversation
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.960]   for the rest of your life?
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:49.640]   So we see that John is given the privilege to be in his presence because he has something
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:54.040]   very, very important for him to write.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.120]   The sinful man is clear, the Old Testament says the sinful man in the presence of God
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:05.360]   without his mercy and grace, without being covered by his blood, would surely die.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.560]   Only because Jesus lays his hand and says, "Fear not."
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:15.320]   Because he's the high priest, he's the mediator.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:21.680]   And so all of this leads to his commissioning.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.080]   He is absolutely sovereign.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.780]   He is alive forevermore that even when you die, you shall live.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.760]   And he has the keys to Hades.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:43.320]   In other words, fear not.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.520]   And then the final, and this is kind of related to, again, going forward to help us to understand
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.640]   these prophecies, his commissioning involves past, present, and future.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.600]   So if you look at, let me put the last part up there.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.040]   He's commissioning, he says, verse 20, "Ask for the mystery of the seven stars that you
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.600]   saw in the right hand."
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:20.560]   Okay, verse 19, "Write therefore the things that you have seen," right?
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.440]   I know there's a delay.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.360]   Past.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.520]   Those that are present.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.200]   Remiss.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:41.560]   And then those that are to take place.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   Okay, future.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:51.120]   So we talked, again, I think we talked about this in the introduction, that why when we
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:56.000]   interpret these visions that we have to keep in mind that he wasn't simply talking about
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.160]   one particular event, right?
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.560]   Because even as he is commissioning him, he says, "Write down what you have seen, what
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.480]   are, and what will be."
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.760]   So when we're trying to interpret these visions, we have to keep that in mind, that John is
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.320]   not just looking at the present.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.840]   He's not only looking at the future.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.380]   He's also looking at the things that he's already seen.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.320]   So we have to dig and find out which makes the most sense.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   So there's always threefold application, right?
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.480]   There's present things that are going on that may have already happened that John has already
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   seen, right?
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:37.960]   And so the things that he has to say to the church of Ephesus, he already knows all of
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   that, right?
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   Those are past tense.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.760]   Those are things that he's already known about them.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.000]   And then there's things that are, meaning that there's things that Christ is fulfilling
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.360]   even at this moment.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.880]   It's not the ultimate deliverance, but Christ, is he their mediator now?
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   Is he their God?
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.160]   Is he the God who is sovereign?
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.960]   Is he the God who will protect them?
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.240]   Like all of these things are true as of now, right?
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.680]   Even as he is writing it.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.200]   And then there's things that he says will be, right?
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.860]   These are things that can be ultimately fulfilled when Christ comes.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.440]   And those are the things that we ought to look for.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:19.360]   So again, everything that he's about to tell us is not present tense, is not past tense,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.200]   is not just future tense.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.080]   It's all three, right?
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.880]   This is how Jesus commissioned him.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:33.960]   All right, that's all I have for today.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.600]   The three discussion questions.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   When was the last time that you thought seriously about the second coming of Christ and how
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.440]   does the hope of the second coming affect your walk with God?
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:47.960]   So I think for today, it'd be great to be in your small group and take some time for
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.120]   personal discussion about where you are in your walk with God.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.560]   Do you have a personal relationship with Christ or is it just a legal standing?
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.240]   And again, I think I mentioned this last week and Sunday and even today.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.840]   So I'm not asking, do you believe in Jesus?
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:11.840]   The question is, do you actually have a personal relationship with Jesus or is it just a legal
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.720]   standing like my sins have been paid for?
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.360]   So how do you understand that?
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.320]   Well, think about any human relationship that you have.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.080]   Does it look anything like it?
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.640]   Is it anything like if you, your relationship with Christ, right?
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   You don't talk to him.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.000]   You don't think about him.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.360]   He's not real to you, right?
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:40.080]   So would you consider that you have a relationship with another person if it looked like the
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.160]   relationship you have with God?
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.160]   That's a little bit more practical.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.080]   Does that make sense?
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.520]   So that's the question that I'm asking.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.800]   I'm not asking where do you stand legally before God.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.400]   It's a much more practical, personal, subjective question.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.240]   Do you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:10.080]   So take some time to think about that because the cliché is it's not religion, it's about
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.320]   relationship and I know it's a cliché and everybody uses it, but it's a cliché for
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.120]   a reason because it's true, right?
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:23.960]   Because at the core of the meaning of that is Christ died for us so that our sins could
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.880]   be forgiven, so that our relationship could be reconciled, so that we can have a personal
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.640]   relationship with our Abba Father, right?
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.320]   So that's a more practical question, number two.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.240]   And third, why do you think the study of the end times is important in the life of a Christian,
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.240]   practically speaking?
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.800]   Why do you think God communicated mostly through visions and dreams when speaking in the end
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:50.080]   times rather than through clear writings like the epistles?
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.880]   We talked a little bit about that last week, but maybe you can take some time to talk about
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:59.280]   this and maybe it'll help us to prepare for the future study in Revelation, okay?
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   All right, so let me pray for us and then I'll get you guys to get into your small group.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:14.080]   Heavenly Father, I thank you for my brothers and sisters and at this time as we break up
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:20.320]   into our small groups, I pray, Father, that you would bless the times that we will have
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.600]   and that discussions would be honest, that we would be transparent, that in our weakness,
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.720]   Lord God, that we would not try to pretend.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:34.480]   And I pray, Father, that those of us who are striving and enjoying our fellowship with
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:40.160]   you, I pray, Father God, that you would turn the frustration into compassion.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:46.520]   Help us, Lord God, to be strong for the brothers and sisters around us and care for them, Lord
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.960]   God, as people that we love.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.280]   For those of us who are struggling and weak, help us to be vulnerable enough to lean on
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   others, to ask for prayer.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.080]   Help us not to think about what they will think.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.520]   And I pray, Father God, that each one of us has been called because we are weak.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.120]   I pray, Lord God, that you would give us the spirit and you give us strength, Lord God,
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.960]   to empty ourselves, that Christ may be magnified.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.640]   So I pray that our small group time will be sanctifying for all of us.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:27.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
