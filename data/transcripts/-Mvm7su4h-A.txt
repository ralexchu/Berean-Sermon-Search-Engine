[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   (Music)
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   Charles Spurgeon himself once said, "There is no joy in this world like union with Christ.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.520]   The more we can feel it, the happier we are."
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.480]   Such a great quote there from Spurgeon.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.200]   You know, union with Christ is the center of our salvation, it's at the center of our
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.620]   sanctification and it's central to all of the deepest joys that we have in this life
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.640]   and dozens of New Testament texts prove the dominance of this theme over and over again.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.640]   So how can we get our head around all these texts and really feel this union as we ought?
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.640]   That's today's email.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.800]   My name is Taylor, a 21-year-old student at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.880]   Thank you for your teaching and preaching over the decades.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.120]   My question is, what is union with Christ?
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.520]   The more I study and read, especially older theologians and church fathers, the more I
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.400]   see this concept spoken of, but it does not make sense to me yet.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.840]   I don't hear a lot of pastors talking about it today even.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.840]   Can you help me?
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.040]   What does it mean to be united to Christ and what are a few of the most significant implications
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.960]   for my life?"
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.760]   I think the most important thing I can do for Taylor is to give him confidence that
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   he can answer this question for himself with his concordance in a way that will bring more
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.960]   assurance and more insight and more transforming power and more personal sweetness and more
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.400]   life application than if he read 10 books about the doctrine of union with Christ.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:51.080]   So my strong suggestion to Taylor and everybody else is that if you must choose—and you
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.800]   don't have to, but let's just say you do, and I hope you don't—if you must choose
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.480]   between reading a book on union with Christ, and there are some great ones, or studying
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.080]   your Bible on union with Christ, then set aside time that you would have spent on that
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.800]   book and type into your search feature in your Bible program on your computer, "In
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.840]   Christ," a little phrase, "In Christ," and you'll find, what, 89 uses or something
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   like that.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.520]   And then type "In Jesus," and you'll only get a handful, like nine.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.480]   And then type in the phrase "In Him."
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.120]   Now, you're going to have to exclude a lot of those because those are going to not all
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.240]   refer to Christ, but dozens of them will.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.240]   And then type in the phrase "In Whom," and then read them all over whatever days
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.160]   and weeks it takes, writing down all that you see about the nature of what it means
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.240]   to be in Christ, what it means to be in Him, what it means to be in Jesus Christ, and its
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.400]   cause—how do you get in?—and its nature, what's it like to be in, and its effects,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.040]   what does it produce when you are in Christ?
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.520]   And I dare say that when you are done, you will have a better grasp on the glories of
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.760]   this biblical truth than if you read many books, even though, if you can, read the books
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.680]   too, because you won't see everything you need to see.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.080]   So let me just give you a taste of what you're going to find if you do that.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm saving my definition, which he asked for, of union with Christ, for the end, in
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.560]   just a minute.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:55.160]   It hangs in great measure on what the word "in" means in the phrase "in Christ."
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:04.400]   And we would be totally unwarranted to think that the idea of being in Christ is used in
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.360]   the same sense in every case.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.800]   For example, Paul says, "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive."
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:25.160]   Well, "in Christ" is like "in Adam," so that's some kind of "hmm, what?"
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.600]   What kind of "in" is that?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.200]   Is that the same meaning as "the branch is in the vine" in John 15?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.480]   I doubt it.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   I doubt it.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.000]   I think John has a different conceptuality of what he's talking about in the nature of
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.280]   the way the juices flow from the branch to the vine that is different from the covenantal
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.840]   idea that Paul had in mind with "in Adam, in Christ."
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.760]   So the point is, there's not just one meaning of "union with Christ."
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.320]   And let me just pause here or put in a parenthesis and say, I am so concerned that seminary students
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.960]   and just Bible students in general get a hold of a theological word or phrase like "union
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.400]   with Christ," and they have this idea, "Okay, that's a reality.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.800]   I've got to go to the Bible and find what that reality is," when in fact that limits
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.100]   their understanding of reality because they've already packed it into one single conceptuality,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.840]   when in fact there may be a half a dozen ways that "union with Christ" is conceived of in
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.000]   the Bible.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.440]   So here's what you're going to see if you do this.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.160]   These are just tastes.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.400]   Ephesians 1:4 says, "God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world."
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.740]   So in Christ, in connection with Christ, God sees us before we existed in such a way that
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.480]   our election hangs on our being connected somehow with Jesus before we even exist.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.620]   Ephesians 1:6 says that we have received grace in the Beloved.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.360]   So in Christ.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:22.320]   So the only way that grace flows to a sinner is somehow in our connection with, union with,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.880]   relationship with—I'm leaving all that undefined right now—in Christ.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.080]   Number three, that's Ephesians 1.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.600]   7 says that we have redemption in Christ.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.220]   So God's purchase of us from bondage to sin and Satan and death becomes real and effective
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.100]   for us in connection with Christ.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.760]   Without this relationship, this connection, you could say union with Christ, we're lost.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   There's no redemption.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   Ephesians 1.13, "In Christ we were sealed by the Holy Spirit."
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.660]   Well, that one's interesting, because now you have the Holy Spirit, who's the active
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.760]   agent, and he does this sealing in Christ.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.520]   Whoa, that's worth an hour or two of reflection and prayer.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:21.760]   The connection with Christ is what makes it possible for the Spirit to secure us forever.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:28.920]   Philippians 3.9 says that the righteousness we need to stand before God we have in connection
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.280]   with Christ, that we may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of our own that
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.320]   comes from law, but that which comes through faith in Christ.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.460]   Same thing in 2 Corinthians 5.21, "For our sake God made him to be sin who knew no sin,
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.280]   so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.960]   Same thing in Romans 8.1, "In Christ there's no condemnation."
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.080]   So we only stand righteous and uncondemned before God because of our connection with
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   Christ.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.680]   We're in Christ.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.680]   First Corinthians 1.30 helps explain why that is.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.360]   You are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360]   redemption.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   In other words, in connection with Christ, we have righteousness that is not ours, but
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   His.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.920]   He became our righteousness.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.760]   He became our wisdom.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.320]   He became our redemption and sanctification, and it all happened in Him.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.520]   So three final observations.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.600]   What's the cause of this inness, this being in Christ Jesus?
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.880]   How did we get into this connection?
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.080]   And right there in 1 Corinthians 1.30, I left out a phrase.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:58.100]   It says, "From God are you in Christ Jesus," because of God, by His agency.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:04.000]   This happens by the new birth, and you can see that in 1 John 3.6 and 3.9, we're abiding
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   in Christ comes from being born of God.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So one way to see the connection or the relation or the union being caused is by God's seed
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.960]   in new birth entering us so that now we have a new nature, a new seed, a new DNA from God,
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.280]   and in that sense, we are united with Christ.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.520]   Here's the second closing observation.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.080]   How do we experience this day by day?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:47.260]   And Paul answers, "By faith, having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.980]   raised with Him through faith."
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.800]   Buried with Him, so you identify with Him, and you die with Him and you rise with Him
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.240]   through faith, Colossians 2.12.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   And if that's how we experience our initial identity with Christ, how do we go on living
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   it?
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.680]   Galatians 2.20, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.080]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.760]   That's an amazing union that virtually you say, "Not I, but Christ, and the life I now
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God."
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   So if you say, "What does it mean to get up in the morning and experience union with
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.600]   Christ," it means you bank totally on Him for the living of your life.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.800]   And the last thing I would say is, in general, I would define union with Christ like this.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:46.600]   It is the reality of all the ways that the Bible pictures our human connectedness to
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:55.440]   Christ in which He is indispensable for every good that we enjoy.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:07.520]   No saving good, no eternal good, no God-exalting good, no soul-satisfying good comes to us
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.680]   except as we are connected to Christ.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.240]   Yeah, that is so good.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   Amen.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.640]   What a beautiful conclusion to the matter.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   Appreciate that.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.480]   And thank you for the question, Taylor.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.160]   And thank you for listening to the podcast over at our online home.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.120]   You can explore about 1300 of our past episodes and you can scan a list from most popular
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.360]   ones, read full transcripts of those episodes, and even send us a question of your own.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.360]   Go to DesiringGuy.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.800]   Well, I think most of us would confirm that gender differences do play a specific role
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.840]   in defining how husbands and wives relate within a marriage covenant.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.920]   But do these biological distinctions also give shape to our roles in society, even for
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.320]   those who are unmarried?
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   That is the final question on the table for the week.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   It's a really good one.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.420]   [END]
