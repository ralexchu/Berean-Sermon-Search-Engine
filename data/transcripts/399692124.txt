[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.280]   You can turn your Bibles to Exodus chapter 3, 13 to 15.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   We're going to take a break in our Hebrews.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.060]   I've been teasing you that we're going to be back in Hebrews for a while.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.360]   But knowing that our children are going to be joining us and that this is probably going
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.480]   to be temporary, I thought it'd be a great time for us, as we said that our theme for
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.780]   this year is knowing Christ and making him known.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.480]   We're going to be spending probably the next month, depending on how long we're together,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.560]   the I Am Statements of Christ.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.680]   And we're going to start today with the I Am Statement where it started in Exodus chapter
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.620]   3, 13 to 15.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.960]   So as you guys are going there, I'll just give you a minute.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   I think it's already on your thing.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.280]   But as a pastor, there's two dreams that pastors have, negative dreams.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.240]   And one is that you show up to church and you forgot your notes and you have to stand
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.720]   in front of people and you got to preach and you just kind of have to wing it.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   And then that's kind of a -- obviously you wake up in a cold sweat.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.240]   The other one is that everybody is -- that you came thoroughly prepared and you show
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.480]   up to church and nobody's there.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.920]   You know, that's the other dream.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.120]   And today my dream has come true.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   Okay.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.320]   So I'm preaching to -- except for you guys here.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320]   Okay.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   All right.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   I'm going to read it.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.320]   But anyway, let me read the passage and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.400]   "Then Moses said to God, 'Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel and I will say to them,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.680]   the God of your fathers has sent me to you.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.400]   Now they may say to me, what is his name?
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.520]   What shall I say to them?'
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.320]   God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.'
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.720]   And he said, 'Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, I am has sent me to you.'
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.880]   God furthermore said to Moses, 'Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, the Lord, the God
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob has sent me
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.040]   to you.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840]   This is my name forever and this is my memorial name to all generations.'"
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.800]   Let me pray.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.100]   We pray that your word would truly go forth.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.120]   Open our ears that we may understand.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.160]   Help us, Lord God, to know who you are.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.960]   That all that we think, all that we feel, all that we do may stem from who you are.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720]   So we pray for your guidance and your blessing.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.780]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.320]   You know, this whole thing has been a blessing in disguise.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.480]   And I know a lot of people that I talk to often say how little time that they have,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.840]   especially if you're working full time and you're taking care of children and by the
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.960]   time you put the children to bed, you're tired, you wake up early to go to work and this pattern
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.480]   goes on and on and on and on.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.360]   And so we speak to many people who are always saying, "It would be great to take a break,
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.560]   spend more time with our children."
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.480]   Well, now you have that time.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.280]   You know, so I want to encourage all of you out there to make the best of the situation
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   that we have, that we don't become like people who are always looking at the grass greener
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.000]   on the other side.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   So when we're working, we want to be home.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.040]   When we're home, we want to be at work.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.600]   That God has given us a blessing in disguise.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.480]   What the virus meant for evil, God means it for good.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.240]   When I think about something that happened in my life with Esther, that at the moment
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.280]   was very difficult but turned out to be the greatest blessing, I have to say it was Isaiah,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.260]   the birth of our fourth son, Isaiah.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.200]   And I remember Esther and I, we were all prepared to move on to our next stage.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.360]   All the children were going to be at school.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.580]   Finally Esther was going to be able to get a job.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.760]   And then we were able to just kind of, you know, be okay financially.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.460]   And then when we found out that Esther was pregnant with our fourth child, Isaiah, obviously
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.480]   we were surprised is an understatement, right?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   Maybe shocked, stared into the space for a while.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.640]   And I remember breaking the news to the church slowly and not one congratulations.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   Not one.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.080]   It was, you know, and I don't want to repeat the things that I heard during that time,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.240]   but it was not encouraging.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.840]   But I can honestly say, and I think we, our whole family would agree, that having Isaiah
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.920]   in our home has been a tremendous blessing.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.040]   And I can't imagine what life would be like without Isaiah.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.760]   Hi Isaiah.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   Hi Addy.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.480]   If I was Pastor Nate, I would say hi to Addy.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.200]   But you know what's really funny?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.720]   Was when we had Isaiah, and obviously my parents, my father who was alive at that time, named
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.320]   Isaiah's name, his Korean name, and it basically means in Korean, the end.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   Or that's enough.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.320]   And I think, you know, the grandparents were saying like four is enough.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.760]   But you know what's funny was Serenity, Jennifer and Tommy's, their fourth child, and I think
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.280]   their birthdays are off by maybe a month or something like that.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   Very close.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   And it was also their fourth child.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.880]   And I didn't know this until years later that her grandfather named her in Chinese, the
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.160]   end.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.360]   So basically it means the same thing in Chinese and Korean.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.240]   You know, I think both grandparents were telling us that's enough.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.680]   We obeyed and they did not.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.200]   And so they had their fifth.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.560]   What's interesting is that the names that are given, at least in the previous generation,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   was very significant.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.640]   That's why when we do baby dedications or presentations, we always ask the meaning of
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   the name.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.920]   So I don't know, you children who are watching out there, if you know what your name means.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.960]   If you don't, you can ask your parents later what the name means.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   But again, in the previous generations, names were given with specific purpose.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.840]   Like this is what is desired of you.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   This is what we're praying that God would do in your life.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.680]   Well, in scripture, the significance of the name is very, very important.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.560]   In fact, when God was doing something really great, he would often change the name of the
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.140]   person that he's working through.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.500]   So if you look in the Old Testament, Abraham's name, which means father, is changed to Abraham
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.020]   because God makes a covenant with him that he was going to be a father of many nations.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.760]   And Abraham basically means father of multitudes.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.840]   Jacob, his name means the one who is slippery or the one who holds the heel because that
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.680]   was kind of like his character.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.880]   He was always kind of maneuvering to get what he wants.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.060]   And then he wrestles with God later on in life where his faith really grows and becomes
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.520]   a man of God.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.680]   And God names his name Israel, where we get the name Israel from.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.040]   And the name Israel basically means the one who contends or wrestles with God.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.000]   And I'm not going to go through all the names, but Simon, the disciple, his name is changed
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   to Rock, Peter.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.800]   And Apostle Paul, he already had both names, but Saul was his Hebrew name.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   But when God calls him to be an apostle to the Gentiles, he predominantly uses his Gentile
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.400]   name Paul.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.740]   And so in the Old Testament and the New Testament, the significance of the name is tremendous
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.680]   because just by reading that person's name, you can tell what God is doing in their life
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.960]   and what God is doing at that particular time in history.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.840]   And it is no exception with our God.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.600]   When we want to know who God is, the first place that we need to start is how did he
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.400]   introduce himself?
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.720]   What is the significance of his name?
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.640]   The way we use it now in our culture, we generally just generically use the word God.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.880]   And as a result of that, I think what has happened is many people, even inside the church,
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   has become confused that whether you call God of the Bible or God of Buddhism or God
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.120]   of the Islam, that maybe it's the same God because we're calling him God, as God is the
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.640]   God who is above.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.080]   But that is not how the Bible introduces God to us.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.140]   You know what's interesting in Korean Christian history?
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:32.160]   When Christianity first began to come into Korea, the generic word for God is "Haneunim."
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.280]   So for a few of you who speak Korean, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.400]   Haneunim is how they used to call him or non-Christians call him.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.520]   It basically means a being that is above.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.520]   Haneunim.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520]   Koreans changed it.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.800]   Korean Christians changed it to distinguish him from the God of the shamans, the shamanistic
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.960]   Buddhist background, and changed that name to Haneunim.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.120]   So if you know what that means, Haneunim means one.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.040]   So the Christians call God Haneunim.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.640]   The generic word in Korean means Haneunim, means the one that is above.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.500]   But in English, we just have a generic word, God.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.360]   And if you don't know what the Bible says and you don't know your faith that well, we
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:19.000]   can mistakenly think that God is God no matter how you call him, no matter what your background.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.800]   But that is not how the Bible introduces him.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:29.080]   The text that we read in Exodus chapter 3, 13 to 15 is where God is answering Moses'
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.400]   question.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.840]   God is about to deliver Israel from bondage from Egypt.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.600]   They were in bondage for hundreds of years, and finally God hears their groaning and answers
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.120]   their prayer, and he calls Moses to speak on his behalf and to go to Israel and say,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.200]   God is going to deliver you.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:54.560]   And he asked a question, when they come and ask me who it is that is giving us this promise,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.600]   God says, tell them this.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.820]   And this is where we get his name Yahweh, or at least it is explained to us.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.920]   So first thing that we need to understand is God is not introducing himself to the nation
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.040]   of Israel for the first time.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.640]   God is not all of a sudden, like Israel didn't know who he was, and then all of a sudden
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.920]   he's saying, well, I'm Yahweh.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.040]   In fact, if you look at the text in Genesis 2, 4 through 9, I gave you a short example.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.840]   And I highlighted every time the word Lord is used.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:33.000]   And if you notice that it should be in your Bibles capital L, capital O, capital R, capital
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.920]   D. It should be.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.640]   If it is not, it's not done correctly.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.520]   The reason why that's highlighted is because every time the word Yahweh appears in the
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:51.080]   Bible, because the Jews didn't want to use the Lord's name in vain, breaking one of the
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   commandments of God, they would not pronounce it.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.920]   Instead, they would use the word Adonai, the word Lord.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.600]   But in the original Hebrew, it has the word Yahweh.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.840]   The reason why I gave you this example is because the word Yahweh, his name Yahweh was
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.040]   used from the very get-go, from Genesis.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.360]   And I only gave you this example, but all throughout the Bible, when the word Yahweh,
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:22.760]   his specific name Yahweh is used, it is much more frequent than the generic word God.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.880]   And the generic word for God is either El or Elohim.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:35.920]   The word Yahweh, his specific name Yahweh is used 6,828 times, where the word God generically
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.080]   is used 2,800 times, singular or in plural.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.160]   The reason why this is significant is because if we're not careful, we can also reflect
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   this generic relationship with God.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   Because we don't know who he is.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.280]   It's just like calling me Asian man, or guy, hey guy.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.720]   You know, we may do that if we don't know, when we meet each other for the first time,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.480]   or calling my name in a crowd to distinguish me from everybody else.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.000]   But if we have a personal relationship, you would not call me, hey dude, hey guy, you
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.800]   know my name.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.840]   You know who I am.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.000]   Well God, God has a name.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.640]   And his name is Yahweh.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.440]   And it is not to say that every time we call him, that if we don't use his name Yahweh,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.760]   that we're not calling the right God.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:34.160]   But again, if we're not careful, our generic understanding of God may be a reflection of
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.520]   a generic relationship that we have with him.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.000]   And it's important for us that God was not introducing himself for the first time.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.200]   He was actually describing himself.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.320]   He wasn't saying, he wasn't saying, what is your name?
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.840]   Who do I tell, what do I say to the nation of Israel who is telling me that he's going
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   to do this powerful thing?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:01.800]   Well he said, tell them, I am who I am is sending you.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   He says tell them, again in verse 14, tell them that I am has sent you.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.040]   And then the third time he says, tell them that Yahweh has sent me to you.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.120]   This is my name forever.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.560]   So in other words, the word Yahweh, or his name Yahweh, is being described.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.880]   And that's why the theologians believe that the statement I am is the description, is
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.120]   the meaning behind the name Yahweh.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.160]   So how significant is this?
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.060]   Extremely significant.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.600]   Because our understanding of who he is, our personal relationship with him, is directly
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   tied to our understanding of who he is.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.120]   Because a lot of people imagine God to be one way or the other.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.600]   Some people think of God as a holy bell hop that if I need something I pray to him, he
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.040]   answers my prayer.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.840]   Or he's a grandfather who always has candy in his pocket.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:04.640]   If I go to him, he always loves me, there is no judgment, and he's always caring no
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.760]   matter what you do.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.300]   Bits and pieces of that is true, but we need to make sure that we understand how the Bible
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.980]   describes who he is.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.880]   So what does he mean when he says I am?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.000]   What does that mean?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.880]   Because Jesus uses that exact same term to describe himself as God of the New Testament.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.520]   He says if you have seen me, you have seen the Father.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.080]   Because he is I am, and then starting from next week we're going to go to the book of
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.840]   John and we're going to be studying through when he says I am.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.540]   I am the bread of life.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.920]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.760]   I am the light of the world.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.960]   What does he mean by that and how is that tied to this, what he's saying here?
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.320]   First of all, there's three things that I want to mention.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   First of all, first and foremost meaning of the word I am is that God is.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.880]   Now if you're paying attention, you should be asking what does that mean?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.920]   Because that's what the word literally means.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.940]   I am means God is.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:19.820]   In fact, there's two very well-read books, one from Francis Schaeffer and another from
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:26.380]   D.A. Carson, and the title, both of the books' title is God Who Is There.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.340]   So I remember the first time picking up this book from Francis Schaeffer, reading the title
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.340]   God Who Is There.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.340]   This guy's some philosopher.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.380]   He's going to be talking about some weird philosophy that I don't understand.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.260]   But one of the most profound things that I learned about the identity of God, that God
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.780]   is.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.900]   And I could probably spend weeks and weeks and weeks just diving into this because there's
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.680]   so much content, it's just in that phrase, God is.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.960]   But for today's sake, and the purpose of this is really to kind of use that as a springboard
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.740]   to get to Christ.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:06.980]   Look what it says in Acts 17, 24 through 18, how God is described.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.100]   The God who made the world and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.600]   does not dwell in temples made with hands.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.860]   Nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.700]   to all people life and breath and all things.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:29.020]   He made from one man every nation of mankind to live in all the face of the earth, having
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:35.620]   determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, that you would seek God.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.780]   If perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:46.060]   us, for in him we live and move and exist.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:52.300]   In the NIV it says we live and move and have our being.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.540]   So our being is directly connected to his being.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.460]   It's because he is that we are able to call ourselves human being.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.380]   So our being is not independent of his being, because our being comes from his being.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:15.100]   So the Bible says the reason why death came to mankind is because we were disconnected
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:22.140]   from his being, because only his being is self-sustaining.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:27.100]   Only his being who is independent of anything else.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.820]   So in order for us to have our being, we need to be connected to his being.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.180]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.420]   I can't tell, because I don't see your face expressions.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:44.740]   But the core of our understanding of our salvation is connected to this.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.500]   You and I cannot have our being independent from him, because our being has a cause and
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.900]   effect.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.580]   We are here because our parents had us, our parents had us because their grandparents
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:01.780]   had us, and we all came from this chain, because ultimately our life, spiritually and physically,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.860]   is tied to something else that has happened.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.680]   When God says that he is, there is nothing beyond him.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.300]   He is independent.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:18.620]   And so when Moses is asking the question, who is going to deliver us from Israel, God
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.220]   is reminding them there is nothing above him.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:28.140]   He is of himself.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:36.860]   From Shakespeare's play, The Hamlet, probably the most famous question is to be or not to
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.860]   be.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.540]   Some of you may be familiar with that, because you did homework when you were in high school
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.060]   or took AP English or something.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.700]   To be or not to be.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.860]   Basically the question to be or not to be is really a question about life.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:59.780]   And if you remember reading that or studying that, basically Hamlet is giving a speech
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:08.300]   or in his speech he basically is going over, should I live or not live?
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.900]   That's basically the question.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.500]   To be or not to be.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.060]   And he goes over the benefits of living.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.300]   But he also goes over the benefits, the sufferings of living.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.540]   The trials of living.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.540]   And then he'll switch over back and forth to what it means to not to be.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:32.400]   And the benefit of not to be is the cessation of suffering.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:39.260]   But then also the difficulty of not to be means to be separated from your loved ones.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.460]   To go somewhere where you have no idea what is there.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.940]   And that's what he contemplates, to be or not to be.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:55.720]   But at the fundamental thing that that question gets wrong is that you and I do not have the
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:01.340]   ability by ourselves to be or not to be.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.640]   Because you and I do not have power of life.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.660]   Our life is dependent on a life source.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.620]   So only God could actually answer that question, to be or not to be.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.300]   Because only he carried out.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.820]   Now we say, well, we can physically take our life, right?
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.400]   So that means that we are able to be or not to be.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.980]   You can physically take your life, but the true life that is inside of us, the Bible
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.960]   says is eternal.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.220]   You cannot annihilate yourself.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.280]   There is a physical life and there's a spiritual life.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.620]   And only God has the ultimate power for that.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:46.260]   And so when he says, when they ask, when they were faced with this tremendous task, who
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.580]   is going to deliver us from the superpower?
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.660]   Egypt was America at that time.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.100]   They were the superpower.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:00.700]   This tiny little group of people who's worshiping this God, he's going to challenge Pharaoh
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.740]   and deliver us?
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.500]   So he's not introducing, hey, my name is Yahweh.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.540]   He's telling them who Yahweh is.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.040]   And the very first thing that he is, he's saying is, I am.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.680]   Tell them, I am has sent you.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.740]   I am has sent you.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.620]   Doesn't matter how great Pharaoh is, no matter how powerful he is, no matter how small Israel
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.340]   is, tell them the God that you serve is I am.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.140]   You know, right now with all the coronavirus thing going on, people are freaking out.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.140]   How many people are going to die?
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.800]   How many people are going to get affected?
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.420]   Be careful that we do not react like the rest of the world.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.540]   Because the God that we serve is I am.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.700]   Hebrews chapter 11, 6, he says, and without faith, it is impossible to please him.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.700]   For he who comes to God must believe that he is.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.540]   This is one of the reasons why I switched to NASB.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.100]   One of the reasons.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.200]   In your other translation, they may say that God exists.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.180]   But I think Hebrew really captures, the NASB really captures the meaning behind that.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.880]   Because it connects us to God of Exodus chapter 3.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:20.380]   It says, before you come to God, you must believe that he is I am.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.840]   Because if you don't believe he is I am, you can make him into something that you want
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.980]   him to be.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.960]   But no matter what you make him out to be, he will always be a lesser God of the Bible.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.540]   No matter how great your imagination, he will always be a lesser God than the God that we
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.540]   see in the Bible.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.800]   There is nothing above I am.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.180]   So whatever you imagine God to be, it is lesser if we do not first and foremost recognize
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.440]   that he is.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.900]   Because if you do not recognize he is, the second part, that he is a rewarder of those
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.220]   who seek him.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:03.620]   If you don't believe that he is, he is not the one you're going to seek.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.060]   You're going to be seeking comfort, you're going to be seeking other authorities, you're
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.040]   going to be seeking a fatter bank account, you're going to be seeking a better marriage,
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:18.020]   you're going to be seeking everything else because you do not truly believe that he is.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.420]   Because he's the only one who has the power of life and death.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.740]   In fact, in the Lord's Prayer, when the disciples asked, "How should we pray?"
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.020]   The first thing that he says in the Lord's Prayer is, "Acknowledge God.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.620]   Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.620]   Recognizing what?
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.300]   That he is.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.100]   In Psalm chapter 90 verse 2, "Before the mountains were born, or you gave birth to the earth
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:49.140]   and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God."
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:57.020]   Now to theists, or to Christians in particular, we don't need to reemphasize this because
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.220]   we already confessed that we believe this.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:07.940]   But there is a huge difference between saying it, confessing it, signing a doctrinal statement,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.520]   and believing it.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.460]   There is a huge difference between the two.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.180]   Sometimes God allows certain things to happen in our lives to refocus our attention.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:26.100]   You guys who are watching me from the internet, you won't know, but our sanctuary looks very
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   different.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.060]   Normally, I like the lights turned all on.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.540]   The reason why I like it turned on is because I can see your faces.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.660]   I know who's falling asleep.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.660]   I know who's tired.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.140]   I know who's alert, who's taking notes, who's going to the bathroom four times.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.780]   I can see all of that.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.540]   But today we deliberately turned off the lights.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:52.420]   And the reason why we did that is so that the film, what do you call it, internet, whatever
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:58.500]   you're seeing on your screen, would have a better effect, to highlight what's going on
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.340]   here.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:05.300]   Sometimes God will turn off the lights in our lives in order to highlight what is most
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.940]   important.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.580]   And I think we will all admit that that's what's going on with us.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.020]   All the clutter, all the busyness, and even though our heart is anxious, that God has
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.500]   taken away all the fluff and right now to focus on what's most important.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   That God is.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.860]   In Revelations 1.8, "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.900]   was and who is to come, the Almighty."
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.980]   So in the midst of all of this turmoil, first and foremost, let's recognize who it is that
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.420]   we serve.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.020]   God is not a God who serves mankind.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.300]   God does not worship us.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.460]   We worship him.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.820]   No matter what country, no matter what authority, no matter how great the army, he is and no
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.420]   one else is.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:02.820]   Secondly, the second meaning or the ramification of his name, "I am," is that God is the ultimate
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820]   cause.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.060]   He is the ultimate sovereign.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.740]   John 5.26, "For just as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son, also
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.820]   he has life in himself."
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:23.060]   Not only does he have life, remember, John 5.26, Jesus basically is saying that he is
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.260]   I am because nobody else has life within themselves.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.540]   Only God can say that and Jesus says, "As the Father has life in himself," he says,
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.820]   "I am."
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.860]   The Son has it.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.140]   But not only does the Son have it, he can give it to other people.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.500]   He's the ultimate cause.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.260]   Only God can create something out of nothing.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:52.940]   There are a lot of really great magicians who are really good, especially some of these
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.940]   street magicians.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.660]   Some of the things that they do, it's mesmerizing.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.640]   People pay a lot of money to go and see.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.980]   But we all know that it's trickery.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.620]   They just happen to be really good at it.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.940]   They can go out in the street and levitate in front of people or turn a $1 bill into
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.940]   a $50 bill.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.420]   I mean, they do some crazy stuff.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:19.220]   But we all know all of that is a movement of the hand and tricking you and diverting
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:25.460]   attention to get you to see over here and then just to wow you with that.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:31.060]   But only God has the ability to create something out of nothing.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:37.020]   And no matter how much you study science, science will never be able to answer that
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:44.340]   question because our reality, something has to come from something.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.860]   No matter whether you believe in the Big Bang or something beyond that, there will always
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.260]   be a question.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.260]   Well what caused that?
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.260]   What was there before that?
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.620]   What was there before that?
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:03.540]   Well if he is, if he's the only being that is independent and sustains by himself, that
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.740]   means all things are coming from him.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.700]   That all questions ultimately stem from him.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.180]   Romans 4.17.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:18.780]   He, God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.260]   Only God can do that.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.660]   Only he can create something that is not there and say it's going to be there.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.380]   Or it is there.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.100]   Everybody else can trick.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.240]   Other people may look to the future.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.260]   Maybe they can prophesy and they can look at the picture and describe what they're seeing.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.380]   But only God could create something from nothing.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.540]   Colossians 1.16-18.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.300]   For by him all things were created, both in heavens and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.340]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.100]   through him and for him.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.980]   He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   So in other words, our God is the ultimate cause.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:08.260]   So let me break that down and how that applies to us.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.060]   Just as God created all things from nothing in the beginning, only he can create a man
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:18.780]   into a new man from being a dead man.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.540]   Only he can recreate a man.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.400]   Romans 8.29-30.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.740]   For those whom he foreknew.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.980]   Basically when he says foreknew, he's talking about people he loves.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.780]   He also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:43.180]   If you notice the whole order of salvation, it's all him from the beginning to the end.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.900]   There is no breaking in and saying, "Well, if you do this, I'll calculate this."
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.900]   He says, "No."
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.940]   Whom he loved, whom he chose, he predestined to be conformed to the image of his son so
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.020]   that he would be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.380]   And these whom he predestined, he also called.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.400]   Whom he called, he also justified.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.020]   And these whom he justified, he also glorified.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:09.580]   In every stage of our salvation, he said, "God did it."
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:15.300]   The reason why you and I do not have power of our own salvation is because you and I
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.460]   cannot exist by will.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.420]   A dead person does not just one day say, "I'm going to live."
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.380]   It doesn't happen that way.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:32.180]   Only God who created and only God can recreate.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.180]   What does this mean?
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:38.460]   Obviously, you and I are here not because we're smart, not because we made some wise
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.460]   decisions.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.700]   It's because God loved us.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.780]   And so he predestined us.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.300]   He opened our eyes so that we may see his glory.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.340]   And then now he is sanctifying us.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:55.060]   And then he will preserve us until the day of glory.
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:59.380]   If you're sitting out there and maybe you haven't confessed Christ as your Lord and
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:07.620]   Savior, maybe the fact that you are even watching this is because God is calling you, that God
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.020]   is beginning to open your eyes and your heart is becoming softened.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:17.660]   And the whole reason why you may be doing that is because God is drawing near to you.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.980]   Only God can recreate man into the image that God intended.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.620]   He is the ultimate cause.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.940]   Because remember, when God calls Moses, remember Moses' response?
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:36.660]   Moses' response was just like any one of us would respond.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.420]   You want me to go to Pharaoh?
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.380]   Pharaoh!
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.620]   I know he lived 40 years in his house, not, you know, they didn't know his true identity,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:53.900]   that he was a Hebrew, but he spent the next 40 years cleaning up and taking care of sheep,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.220]   which at that time would have been the lowliest of jobs.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:06.380]   So maybe for the first couple years, maybe he was humbled, but 40 years, he forgot about
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:12.200]   Egypt's, you know, Egypt's palace a long time ago.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:18.140]   His identity now, after 40 years, is he's a shepherd.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:25.940]   You're calling a shepherd to go talk to Pharaoh and demand that Israel be released?
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.740]   So his response was like anybody else.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.260]   I'm not a good speaker.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.180]   In fact, my older brother Aaron, he's the one who speaks, he's always the one who's
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.220]   putting me down.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.100]   He has words, not me.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.860]   I stutter.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.380]   And you would think that God would say, well, you know, stop being humble.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.940]   You're better than you think you are.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.940]   You would think that God would say that from our perspective.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.380]   No, but he gets rebuked.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:58.460]   And the reason why he gets rebuked is because he didn't know who God was.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.180]   I didn't call you because I needed your help.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:07.420]   I didn't ask you to do this because I created a universe, but Pharaoh, I can't handle without
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.580]   your words.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.740]   I created your mouth.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.220]   I created Aaron's mouth.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:20.900]   So I am calling you not because I need you, because I choose to use you.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.740]   And he was again reminding him, I am.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:30.700]   Not only was he telling Israel, but he was telling Moses, go speak on my behalf because
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.660]   tell them I am ascending you.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.460]   He wasn't just telling Israel.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.420]   He wasn't just telling Moses.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.700]   But ultimately, the way he delivers Israel, he was going to declare his glory to Egypt
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.460]   and to Pharaoh.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.900]   He was going to show him who I am is.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.700]   They were sitting on the top of the world thinking everybody else is going to have to
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.900]   be subject to him.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:02.260]   He's going to use this tiny little nation who was serving as slaves at the time, and
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.360]   he was going to declare I am.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.060]   Tell him I am has sent you.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:15.740]   You know, when all of this happened, our vice president, Pence, took the people who were
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:21.100]   overseeing the coronavirus and making decisions, and they had a prayer meeting, and the media
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.380]   went nuts.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.660]   How can we get this superstitious guy who's going to be praying to some unknown God, how
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.300]   can we allow him to make decisions?
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:37.580]   We need somebody smart, not somebody religious.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:42.100]   That is exactly what we need now.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.440]   No matter how smart we are, no matter how many smart people are putting their attention
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.100]   on this, you and I do not have the power.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.180]   This pestilence didn't happen because we didn't have enough smart people in the world.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.460]   It's not spreading because we don't have enough money in the world.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.020]   It's not happening because we're not organized enough that maybe people are thinking that
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.380]   if we made the right decision at the right time with the right people, with the right
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.340]   money, with the right organization, this wouldn't have happened.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.020]   That is nonsense.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:25.340]   Do not forget that when God chose to deliver Israel and to show his glory, he used pestilence.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:31.820]   And every one of those 10 plagues was an idol that they were worshiping.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.940]   And one of the things or many of the things that God used to demonstrate his power was
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:41.340]   pestilence to show them that you do not have power.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.420]   That he is the only I am.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.000]   Third and fourth, third, finally, the third meaning of his name is that God is the ultimate
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.900]   goal of our existence.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:58.160]   Not only is he self-existing, not only is he the cause, he's our ultimate goal.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.620]   Our purpose in life is ultimately to get to him.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.020]   Because that was the biggest problem in our life.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.940]   All the problems that we have, maybe you're having struggling with your children, maybe
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.020]   because of what's going on now, there's going to be many, many people who's going to lose
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.500]   their jobs.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   We feel for you.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.700]   A lot of you health workers who are literally risking your health and possibly even your
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:27.780]   lives to be in the front line, you're doing something very, very noble.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.580]   But our greatest problem is not financial.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.640]   Our greatest problem is not physical.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.520]   Our greatest problem is not governmental.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.580]   Our greatest problem is spiritual.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:46.520]   The Bible says that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.760]   Meaning that we've all been separated from I am.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.320]   From this being.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.060]   So we're trying to have this being independent from God.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:00.920]   But just like any other household products, when you disconnect it from the source of
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.880]   power, what happens?
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.920]   Either it will die immediately or maybe you have one of those rechargeable batteries.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.840]   It'll last for a while but eventually it will wind down and it will also die.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.960]   It's just a matter of time when you are disconnected from the source of life.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.320]   The Bible says that all of mankind, because of our sins, we've fallen short of that glory
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.460]   and we are slowly winding down.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:32.500]   That's why a one-year-old versus a 90-year-old is closer to the finish line.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.600]   We don't grow and we don't become more alive as we get older.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.360]   We become less alive as we get older.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.880]   Because we are all winding down.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.400]   And the Bible says that inasmuch as it's appointed for all men to die once, after this comes
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   judgment.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.300]   The second death, our spiritual death.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:59.940]   So our greatest goal in mankind before anything else is to be reconnected with this being,
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.220]   with this I am.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:09.300]   You know the problem with the health and wealth gospel is that they see God as an avenue to
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.980]   pursue their idols.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.640]   That God is not the ultimate source.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   God is not their ultimate goal.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.360]   God is somebody that they go through to get what they want, health and wealth.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.200]   And that's why that's so destructive.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.240]   Because even though they may be preaching the same gospel, they are not worshiping the
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.200]   same God.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.600]   God is the ultimate goal of our salvation.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   John 17.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   3.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.900]   This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.200]   have sent.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.440]   This is eternal life.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.720]   This is not how you get eternal life.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.600]   It says this is eternal life, that they may know you.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.360]   Knowing God is eternal life.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.240]   Our being is connected to his being.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.960]   And that's what he means.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.680]   Christ came and he suffered for our sins, for the penalty of our sins that you and I
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:07.440]   deserve in order that he may restore us back into a relationship with this being.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.920]   That's why Jesus says in John chapter 14 verse 6, I am the way.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.300]   I am the truth and the life.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:22.420]   No one comes to the Father but through me.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.460]   It's not that we have Christ and health.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:34.060]   It's not that we have Christ and a job, and a good family, and friends, and even church.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:40.740]   In the end, God will allow certain things to happen in our life for us to recognize
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:47.340]   that all I have is Christ and all I ultimately need is Christ.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.540]   Right now, all of us, there are certain things that we value and like, certain habits that
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.780]   we've had.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.300]   Certain things are very important.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:02.020]   Your health and finances, they are important.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.500]   But in the end, where are you with Christ?
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.980]   God has turned off the light, not just locally, but globally.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:16.580]   A lot of people don't like getting on Facebook because many people have shared with me how
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.840]   they covet and sometimes they feel left out.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.200]   They don't like what looking at Facebook does because they see what everybody else does
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.860]   in the world, which is, to be honest, it's not fake, but they're highlighting the best
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.060]   part of their life.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.420]   They don't record themselves getting angry at their children.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.980]   They don't record themselves when the food that they cook burned or they get fired from
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   a job.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.980]   They don't post things like that.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.980]   I mean, who would?
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.220]   I wouldn't.
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.580]   So we get to see the highlights, the good things that we want to present, and then when
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.740]   we look at that, we covet and we get jealous.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.460]   It's like, "Oh, why are other people's lives like this?"
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.940]   But when you actually talk to people, we're all going through the same thing.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.920]   But now I invite you to come onto Facebook because it's easier for me to communicate
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.580]   with you and there's nothing to covet.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.820]   Everybody's home.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.740]   Nobody is traveling.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.940]   Nobody is eating great food.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.140]   All the restaurants are closing.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.420]   There's no great things.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.100]   Nobody's outside playing basketball, or they shouldn't be.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.840]   We're all experiencing the same thing.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.740]   God has turned the lights off.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.260]   Why has he done that?
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.660]   Why did he put us in a place where we are sitting hours upon hours of, "How are we
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.460]   going to fill this day?"
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:43.540]   Maybe some of that is so that the light can shine on the I am.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.660]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.020]   I saw this on the internet and I thought it was really interesting.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:53.420]   It was a woman who was stuck at home with her teenage girl and was having a conversation
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.380]   and she was so encouraged by what her daughter said that she put it online.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.380]   And so let me read this.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:03.540]   It says, again, this woman describing her conversation with her 15-year-old daughter
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.900]   said, "I had a very interesting conversation with my 15-year-old yesterday.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:12.300]   She said, 'You know, mom, God has allowed us to be at a point in this country where
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.940]   so many of our gods are being taken away.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:26.660]   Sports, the arts, entertainment, education, money, travel, and even church and traditions.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:33.860]   I am thinking maybe he wants us to get our eyes on him and be like the early church in
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.980]   small groups learning and growing in him.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:41.000]   We are blaming the big government for this chaos and confusion.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.540]   Have we ever stopped to think that God in his wonderful loving kindness is giving us
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.500]   this opportunity to experience him fresh and anew?
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.900]   He is sovereign.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:52.900]   He is good.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:58.060]   I, for one, was very convicted by her words."
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.580]   You know, all of you out there, you have the print of that and I was so encouraged, challenged,
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.660]   and rebuked at the same time.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:09.540]   I pray that what God is doing all over the world would not be wasted on us.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:15.140]   That at the end of this, that we would come out more focused, more loving, more challenged,
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.860]   more sober than ever.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:23.740]   Let's pray.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.300]   Sorry before I pray, if I can have the priest come up.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.820]   I wanted to sing this song.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.060]   So the way we are going to end this is we are going to sing this song, "All I Have is
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.540]   Christ" because it correlates with what I just spoke.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:40.060]   I am going to ask you guys instead of taking time to pray, I mean you can pray as we are
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.900]   singing this, but after we pray we are going to sing this song and we are going to finish
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:51.140]   it and then we are going to finish our service for today.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:58.140]   But starting from tomorrow, again, our church is going to be more present online through
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.860]   our Facebook, through various media.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.260]   You are going to see more devotions and possibly video content.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:14.740]   Our soul ministry, our sprouts and seeds and vines ministry, they have already made a bunch
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.180]   of videos for the children to see and I am very thankful because we didn't ask them to
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.100]   do that, they just did that on their own.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.220]   So very thankful for so many people.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:28.820]   And also, many generous people have donated masks and I do have different masks still
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:34.700]   at home so if you are in the health work system and not only for you but you want to get some
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.580]   for your friends, I still have some so please text me or email me and I will be able to
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.340]   get that out to you.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.740]   But again, let me read this song.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.660]   All I have is Christ and I want to review it over with you so that when you sing it
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:50.300]   that this would really be your confession.
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:56.540]   I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.460]   The sin that promised joy in life had led me to the grave.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:07.120]   I had no hope that you would own a rebel to your will and if you had not loved me first,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:10.340]   I would refuse you still.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:16.500]   But as I ran my hellbound race, indifferent to the cost, you looked upon my helpless state
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.520]   and led me to the cross.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.820]   And I beheld God's love displayed, you suffered in my place, you bore the wrath reserved for
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.380]   me, now all I know is grace.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:34.340]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ, hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.180]   Now Lord, I would be yours alone and live so all might see.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.940]   The strength to follow your commands could never come from me.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:49.540]   Oh Father, use my ransom life in any way you choose and let my song forever be, my only
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.340]   boast is you.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.740]   All I have is Christ, Jesus is my life.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.780]   Let's pray.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:04.680]   Father, I pray that the words of this song would be our honest confession.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:11.140]   Whether we have been sober entering into this or whether we have been drifting, we pray
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:17.540]   Father God that your word and your spirit would cause us to have a fresh look at the
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.580]   glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:27.760]   That we would be able to confess that you are I am and we are because of you.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.440]   So we ask Lord God that you would bless this time, amen.
