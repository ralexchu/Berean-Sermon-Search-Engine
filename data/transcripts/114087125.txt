[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Chapter 3, I'll be reading from verse 14 to 17.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   2 Timothy 3, verse 14 to 17.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "But I ask for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work."
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   We thank you for the opportunity that we have to celebrate the communion table
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and to remember, Lord, of Christ's sacrifice and what it means for us.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   We pray, Father God, that your love for us and your sacrifice would never be old news,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   but it would constantly change us, renew us,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   to establish a firm foundation, Lord God, on which we are to build our life in our church.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   We ask, Lord, that you would be gracious in allowing your word to speak
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and challenging us, teaching us, rebuking us, correcting us, Lord God,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   that the man of God may truly be equipped for every good work.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   May your name be blessed as we come to bless you. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Again, as you guys know, 2 Timothy, as we continue to study, is being written to Apostle Paul's disciple.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And the environment in 2 Timothy is very different than the environment that he wrote his first letter,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   even though not a whole lot of years have passed by.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   The first letter that he writes in prison to the Philippians, there is a tinge of hope.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   In fact, he says he's confident he's going to come out.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   The result of the persecution, more Christians have become more bold to preach the gospel.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Yet here in 2 Timothy, the persecution has intensified.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   There's been confusion of doctrine in the church of Ephesus.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And most likely Nero has kind of revered up the persecution and people are actually being executed.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And Paul being one of the first, being the leaders, and eventually Peter will be caught.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And every one of the disciples will be caught and some way or another will be executed.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And so Timothy and the other companions of Paul are beginning to backslide.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Some of them are beginning to go back.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   In Timothy, again, there's danger of him becoming timid and afraid.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   You know, whenever we run into some kind of crisis in our life,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   whether it's an individual crisis or a crisis in the church,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   it causes us to re-look at everything.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So sometimes you would get sick, and I'm talking about serious illness that comes into your life,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and then you take a step back and you begin to evaluate how you spend your time,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   how you spend your money, your outlook on life.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   What am I pursuing? Is this right to pursue, not to pursue?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And so that causes us to have a change in paradigm,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and oftentimes it kind of brings a new trajectory in our life.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   That happens even in the church.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Certain things happen, and we want it to be a certain way, and it is not,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and it causes a crisis, and this crisis causes us to re-examine the church, re-examine what we do.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I remember in the late '80s and early '90s,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   there was a crisis in the church because almost weekly, monthly,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   there was something being written about how the church is failing.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And there were statistics coming out left and right.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   For every two people convert, three people are backsliding.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And in particular, within the Southern Baptist denomination,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   they were saying that the churches were closing faster than they were being reproduced.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And in particular with the younger generation.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   The younger generation, they said the statistic was,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   they graduate high school, by the time they go through college and get to young adult,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   anywhere between 40 to as high as 87 to 90% were walking away from their faith.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And so churches are closing down.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The gospel is not being effective.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And so everybody's scrambling to, what are we doing?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Maybe the traditional way of doing ministry isn't working.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And all of a sudden, we start hearing these rumors about this one particular church,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   which I'm not going to name, of how they're being effective in reaching the young people.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And how this church is growing in mass numbers.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Thousands and thousands of them are coming.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And so all of a sudden, all the church growth, church planters,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   started to study this particular church.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And then they began to model that church and started to teach this in seminary.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And started to teach the young pastors who are being trained in seminary,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   that this is what we ought to do.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   If we want to be effective, we have to follow this model.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And this model that I'm talking about is the modern day church growth movement.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's the seeker-friendly movement.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And that movement came out of a crisis in the church.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Because very few people were evangelizing.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We weren't reproducing.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   The churches are falling out.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The pastors are--we're getting news about pastors, one scandal after another.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And so in this crisis, it kind of caused the church to take a step back and look at it and say,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "What are we doing different?"
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Now, that's been over 20 years since that movement came in.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And I remember first time hearing about this, there was a lot of debate.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I remember learning about this in seminary.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I was listening to--my first reaction to that was,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   "Well, if we need to do everything in our power to get the gospel out,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   and whatever they choose to do, at least that's better than nothing."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That was my initial response to that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   But now that 20-some years have passed, and we're looking at this modern day movement,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   definitely our paradigm in the last 20, 25 years,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   you could see the radical shift where we've turned to pragmatism.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   What works and what doesn't work?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Here's a problem. How do we deal with it?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Well, what did they do?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Well, they did this, so we're going to apply that to this church.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Well, here's a problem at this church.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Well, how did this church deal with it?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   So we're going to go over there, and they'll have this church organized this way,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   so we're going to apply that here.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And that type of thinking has permeated into the way that we do church.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Everything we do is, "Well, here's a problem. How do we solve it?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That church solved it. This is how we ought to solve it."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But the problem with that method is,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   there is an overemphasis on human methodology,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   thinking that every problem that we run into in the church can be easily solved
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   if we apply the right method and right organization.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But, you know, as a young pastor, when I first started ministering in my 20s,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   part of the reason why I was so tempted to quit is because I tried everything.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I tried discipleship.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I tried one time even shaving my head, saying,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   "I'm not going to grow my hair until revival comes."
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Then after a while, the hair started growing out, and I didn't cut it.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I tried everything.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I said, "Well, maybe we'll take them out on the streets and go street preaching."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Now to kind of shake them up and make them love Christ and discipleship.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And we tried everything, and in the end, I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So I started thinking to myself that maybe I just don't know what I'm doing.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I thought all I had to do was preach the Word of God and be passionate in prayer
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and cling to Him, and that was it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But when I started doing ministry, it started to seem like that isn't enough.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So I started thinking to myself, "Maybe I need to go back to school
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and get a degree in accounting or business so I can learn how to organize a church.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Maybe I need to go get a psychology degree so I can learn how to counsel people
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and help people out of different issues."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   But I felt so defeated.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I felt so ill-equipped.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   But in that context, there was one thing that I observed.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Again, it wasn't through preaching.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   It wasn't through reading of a book.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It was just an observation that I was making through the years of struggling.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And that observation was the people that I saw consistently persevering.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And every single one of them had one thing in common, and that one thing was
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   they loved the Word of God.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Now they weren't all conservative.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Some of them were charismatic.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Some of them were from different persuasions.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But every single person that I saw, not just one year, not just coming back from a retreat
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   or going to a summer mission and coming back and saying, "Yeah, I want to do this for God."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   But consistently throughout the years, there's one thing that was consistent.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   They all loved the Word of God.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   They all had a self-motivated interest in learning God's Word.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And that probably is one of the most important lessons I learned as a pastor
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and as a Christian, to stick to His Word.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And here's a passage that, again, I quote quite a bit, but that I quote to myself often
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   because I need to be reminded of this.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   In Isaiah 55, 10 through 11, it says,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It shall not return to me empty; it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   The reason why I quote this passage to myself so often is because
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I don't see the result of the Word of God often with my eyes and with my perception.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Because I imagine that the Word of God would bear fruit in this way.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so when it doesn't happen that way, I start to think, "Maybe this is not effective."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   See, what the Word of God clearly says, that God sends his Word,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and it will not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Now, that purpose is not always what you think.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Because oftentimes, God sent his Word to harden people's hearts.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Remember Isaiah? After showing him a vision of his glory?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   You know, he's seen a magnificent picture of our holy, holy, holy God.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And then he says, "Who's going to go for me and speak on my behalf?"
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And he says, "Here am I. Send me."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And then when he volunteers, what does God say?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   "Go to these people, these Israelites, these stiff-necked people.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   They're not going to listen to you, but go tell them what I have to say."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Why send it to them?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   If they're not going to listen, what's the point?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, there are times when God would send his Word to bring judgment to his natural conclusion.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Just like he did with Pharaoh.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Pharaoh didn't take a guy who was submitted to him and then change his heart and then judged him.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Here's a guy who was running the wrong path.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   It's just the Word of God goes forth and hardened his heart even further.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So when the Word of God goes forth, even this morning, when the Word of God goes forth,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   it never returns without accomplishing its purpose.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Some of you will hear the Word of God, and your heart will be softened,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   and the Holy Spirit will speak and bring you closer to him.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Some of you will hear the Word of God, and you say, "Wow, I've heard that."
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And you harden your heart.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And every week that you hear the Word of God and you do not surrender to him,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   your heart becomes harder and harder and harder.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So by the time you've sat through service, year after year, maybe decade after decade,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   your heart becomes so hardened that the Word of God never penetrates.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   In fact, your condition a year from now will be much worse than it is now.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   If you happen to be in the presence where the Word of God is taught consistently
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   and you're being exposed to what the Word of God says,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and you continue to harden your heart, harden your heart, harden your heart,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   you will at one point come to a situation where even the greatest preacher of our generation
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   comes and gives his best message, you will hear, "Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   That's the first thing you're going to hear.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Because your ears have become dull.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And you have to almost experience something shocking in order to have any kind of,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   "Oh, okay, I need to do that."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   One of the most important things that I had to learn as a pastor is that what God called me to do
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   is to teach and to preach his Word faithfully, because that's what God has ordained.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   In fact, look at the nation of Israel.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   There's one lesson.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   People look at the Old Testament and New Testament, there's so many different nuances.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I don't understand the Word of God.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'll make it simple.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The Word of God has one lesson.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Obviously, there's a lot of sub-lessons in that lesson, but there's only one lesson.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And he teaches this one lesson consistently from generation to generation,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   from one covenant to the next.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   If you look at the nation of Israel, they're wandering in the desert for 40 years.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Now, we know that they wandered in the desert as a result of their rebellion.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   They didn't believe in God, so God judged them, so they wandered in the desert.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But God had a hidden purpose, and that purpose is to prepare them to go into the Promised Land,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   to teach them this one lesson.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Here's a nation that was born from a bunch of slaves,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   and then God was preparing them to go into the Promised Land.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Now, they were going to go in immediately, but because they didn't believe God,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   they wandered in the desert for 40 years.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   God was preparing them to conquer the Promised Land.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Now, what did they learn in 40 years?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   For 40 years, God told them to march in order, to march in order.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Let the Levites go, and then you have the next tribe and the next tribe.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   So they became expert marchers.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   If anybody knew how to march, it was the Israelites, because they practiced this for 40 years.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   If you ever go to a country where they don't have a lot of opportunities,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   so whatever you do, you do for a long period of time.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Like, if there's certain parts of China, like when we go there,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and you see them flipping pancakes, man, they are experts.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Because that's all they have been doing for the last 30 years, they flip pancakes.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Boom, they catch it in the back, flip it back, catch it, and it was like, we're amazed.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Because we live in a society, we have so many opportunities,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   there's nothing we do for 30 years every single day, right?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   We switch jobs, we get bored.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But you go to certain parts of the world, whatever it is that they're doing,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   putting inscriptions on a little piece of rice, I mean, they're experts.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Because that's what they've been doing for 30 years, right?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Whatever you're doing for 30 years, you become an expert.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So what were the Israelites experts in doing?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Marching.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Okay, what else were they, what else was God doing with the people?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Well, he had to put the tents in. Boom.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   30 years, boom.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   So if you ever want to know how to set up a tent, ask the Israelites.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   They've been doing this for 30 years, right?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   In fact, it wasn't even all the tents.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Only a certain group of them could actually pound it in.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And only a certain group of them could actually carry it.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   So these guys who pounded it in, they were experts at pounding in this pole, right?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And then there was another group of people who were experts in carrying it over their shoulder.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And then there was another group that was expert in carrying the Ark of the Covenant, right?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   So every single one of them became experts in whatever they were doing for 30 years.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   They were expert campers.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   You want to know anything about camping? That's what they're experts in, right?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   They did it for 30 years. They know how to camp. They know how to march.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   But what does any of that have to do with conquering this nation?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   In fact, at the end of that, what does God tell them to do?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   They're ready to go in to conquer. What does he do?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Here's the only instruction that God gives the nation of Israel as they're about to enter into the Promised Land.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Joshua 1.7.9, "Only be strong and courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Have not I commanded you? Be strong and courageous.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Now you would think that, okay, we've wasted 40 years, right?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   In 40 years they didn't learn how to shoot arrows, they didn't know how to defend themselves,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and how to throw spears. They didn't learn any of that.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   They learned how to march, they learned how to put poles in, right?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   They learned how to camp.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Well at least now that we're going, okay, we'll trust you, right?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And he says, "Just listen. Don't turn away from my word."
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Okay, so we're going to go in, so we're listening because this is the only thing you told us.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   What do you want us to do? What does God tell them to do?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   March. They know how to march. They've been doing that for 40 years.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   March around the city of Jericho.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   So there's no question, it's like, okay, you told us to march for 40 years, we know how to do this.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Picked it up, they marched. Second day, okay, you know,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I don't get what you're doing, but what do we do the second day?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   March again. So they march.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   They do this six times, right?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   On the seventh day, he said, "Okay, God says, today is the day.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Today is the day where I'm going to anoint you and you're going to conquer this city.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Okay, now, okay, now we've been doing this silly thing about walking around.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   What do we do on the seventh day?" Now, on the seventh day, do it seven times.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Seven times. And you know exactly what happens.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   On the seventh time, they turn around, they carry this Ark of the Covenant,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and what happens? The wall just crumbles.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And they walk in, they don't even have to fight.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   They walk in and they conquer. What was God trying to teach the nation of Israel?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   In fact, if you read the book of Numbers, and again, years ago,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I remember preaching through the Old Testament, and we got through Leviticus,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   and I really wasn't looking forward to preaching through Leviticus,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   for obvious reasons. I would just, I would just,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   that's not a book that I was very familiar with.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But I gained so much. And the more patient you are,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   and the more you dig in the book of Leviticus,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   you see so much of it connected to Christ and the Gospel.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But Numbers, right, what do you connect?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Like 12,000, 144,000, 18,000, like, and it over and over again,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   it gives you the count of the nation of Israel.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   This tribe had this many people, and these are the people,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and you just have genealogy over and over again.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   So what am I going to get out of this, right?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   In fact, Numbers was the book that really kind of shook me,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   because it was so clear what God was doing with the nation of Israel.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   See, Numbers, the reason why they count,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   basically, they enter into the desert with 600,000 people.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   They exit out of the desert with 600,000 people.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But if you pay attention to the list carefully,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   you will notice that the number in each tribe
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   either goes up or comes down.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   So some of the tribes who enter, entered in a pretty big tribe,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   they come out of it almost depleted in half or even more.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And then there are some tribes that come in, a tiny little tribe,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and they come back almost doubled, more than doubled.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   But the total number stays the same.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And the reason why this is significant is based upon
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   how well they kept the Word of God, how obedient they were,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   that their inheritance, when they got to the Promised Land,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   was given to them.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   So there is this one particular tribe, the Simeonites,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   because they were disobedient, almost half of them were slaughtered,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   24,000 of them were slaughtered.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   By the time they come to the Promised Land, their tribe is so small,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   they don't even get their own land.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   They get a little piece of land within the land of Judah.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Now, there's a lot more to the Book of Numbers than that,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   but the whole purpose of the Book of Numbers
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   is to teach the nation of Israel the same thing that he was teaching
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   the nation of Israel in Joshua 1, 7, 8, 9.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   "Do not turn from my Word to the left or to the right."
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   If you want to be successful,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   "Do not turn from my Word to the left or to the right."
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And the reason why I say this is that whenever there is
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   some kind of a crisis, whether there's a personal spiritual crisis,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   or there is a crisis in the church,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   we have a tendency to start looking out to see,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   maybe we've missed something.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Maybe there's something happening in that church,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   or this church, or over there,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   and if we adopt what they're doing and do it here,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   that we would have the same success.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   But the Word of God is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   "Do not turn from my Word to the left or to the right."
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Paul says in the later passage in 2 Timothy,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   to preach the Word in season and out of season.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   In other words, what Paul is saying,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   preach it when people respond, preach it when they don't respond.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Preach it when you bear fruit, preach it when they don't bear fruit,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   because there will never be a time when the Word of God will go forth
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and will return without accomplishing God's purpose.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   See, Paul is writing to Timothy because right now
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   it seems like it's not in season.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   When Paul wrote his first letter in Philippi,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   when he was in prison,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   it was exciting. Even though he was in prison,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Paul says, "I know I'm going to come out,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   because there's still more work to do."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And he says, "Because of my chains,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   more people have gotten confidence to preach the Word of God boldly."
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   So even in the midst of persecution,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   it was like, you know, they were like rock stars.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   They were going to a city and preach,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   and people heard about them.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   These are the guys who were coming, Paul and his companions,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   who were flipping the world upside down
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   with his preaching about Jesus.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   So, I mean, imagine how exciting that would be,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   to be a part of that team, going from city to city,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   experiencing some persecution, planting churches,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   leaders of synagogues coming to Christ,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   people of prominence, people who are poor.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   I mean, they're coming to you and they say,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   "What do we do about this?" I mean, that was exciting.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Right now, Paul is writing,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   and the persecution has increased.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Now the persecution is not coming from the Jews,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   it's coming from the Roman Empire now.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Now the Gentiles, who have real authority, real power,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   are starting to go after them, and that's exactly what happens.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Paul is one of the first who gets captured.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Then Peter will get captured.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Then every one of the apostles will be captured.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Eventually, Timothy will be captured,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and Barnabas will be captured.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And every single one of them that we see in the New Testament,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   being faithful, majority of them are martyred for their faith.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And so on the surface, we may look at that and say,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   "You know what? It's no longer popular.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Maybe what we've been doing doesn't work.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   You know, in the past, we were going into the city,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   and people were responding. Now we go in, we get stoned,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   we get put into jail, and we die."
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   That's the reason why Paul is telling Timothy
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   to continue where you've come from.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Remember we talked about that last week?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   You know, we're always looking for new things,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   but what does Paul say? "Continue. Remember.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Remember where you came from.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Remember how you got the Word, and continue," he says,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   "to continue."
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Remember when Jesus was leaving the disciples,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   and the disciples were saying, "You know what?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   We were dependent upon you.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You know, the Pharisees came, and they hated you,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   but as long as we were with you, we were safe.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   What are we going to do once you leave?"
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Remember what Jesus said?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Same thing that God's been telling the nation of Israel.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   "If you want to bear fruit, abide in Me.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I am not leaving you as orphans.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   When I go, the Holy Spirit's going to come,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   and He's going to remind you of everything that I've said,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and through Him, I want you to remain in Me.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Continue to remain in Me.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Your success is dependent upon
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   whether you remain in Me or not.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Not how smart you are, not the new methods,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   not trying to apply new things and new organizations,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   but how closely you remain with Him."
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Isn't that exactly what God's been teaching
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   the nation of Israel?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   What were they learning in the 40 years
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   marching out in the desert?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   If I tell you to stop, you stop.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   If I tell you to get up, you get up.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   If I tell you to get in line, you get in line.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   If I say, "You touch the pole, but not you,"
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   listen to what I say.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   What were they being trained to do?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   To abide in Him, to listen to Him.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And is it any different in the New Testament?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   It is not.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Same preaching of the Word of God.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I've been preaching long enough to know
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   that there are times that I will preach
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   the exact same sermon, and people will respond
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and repent and come to Christ.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And there were periods when I would preach
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   the exact same sermon, and people would say,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   "What is that?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   You can't preach like that.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   No one's going to come to your church if you do that."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   But the Word of God, He says,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   "That's what God has ordained."
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   If we're going to bear fruit,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   if we're going to be servants of God,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   you must first and foremost have confidence
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   and conviction that this is what God has ordained.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Not my method, not my cleverness,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   not my education, not your money,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   but the Word of God.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And that's why that Paul is telling Timothy,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   "You continue."
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   That's how Jesus described ministry
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   as spreading seed.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   What's the seed?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   The Word of God.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And sometimes the Word of God will go forth,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   and they're not going to respond.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   It's going to fall on rocky soil,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   and then the devil's going to come pick it up.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   But yet, you preach the Word of God.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Sometimes the Word of God is going to be spread,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and then it's going to seem like it's going to bear fruit,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   but because there's no foundation,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   it's going to wither and die.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But you keep preaching the Word of God.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   It keeps spreading.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Sometimes you're going to spread the Word of God,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   and it's going to seem like there's some response,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   but as soon as hardship comes and difficulty comes,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   people wither.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   But you keep preaching the Word of God.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Isn't that what Jesus said?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Some are going to reject you.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Some are going to seem like they're going to receive you,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   but a few will receive it,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and they will bear fruit 30, 60, 100-fold.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Isn't that exactly what Paul said,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   how he described his ministry?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   He said, "I planted."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   "Apollos watered."
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   But ultimately, God makes it grow.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "I can't. It's not up to me or you to cause things to grow."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   He says, "To plant, to water."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Let people be exposed to what the Word of God says,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and let God do what he had intended to do.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   See, when we have a spiritual crisis,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   we automatically begin to think there's got to be something more.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   You know, this church is about the Word of God,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   but I need something more.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I need better friendship.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Maybe if we had this one organization.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Maybe if we had this and that,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and we're looking for all these different things
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   to cause us to come to Christ,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   but in the end, what God has ordained is,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "You have the Word of God."
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   What does he say about the Word of God?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It is able to make us wise for salvation.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   It is able to make us wise for salvation.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Why do we need to cling to the Word of God?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Because that's where salvation comes from.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Remember John 6, chapter 666,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   when all the disciples, everybody who ate
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   the miraculous food that Jesus gave them,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   the feeding of the 5,000,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   they had a hard time understanding what Jesus was saying,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   so they turned away.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Jesus asked his disciples, "Are you going to go too?"
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Remember what Peter says?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Peter answered, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You have the words of eternal life."
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Where can we turn to?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I might be able to go down and do business,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   and make more money, and buy the food,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   but if I want life, you have the words of life.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   That's what caused his disciples to persevere with them.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Not because they knew anything better than the other people,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   not because they were more noble than the other people.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   They believed that Jesus had the words of life.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   What keeps you coming to church?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   What causes you to persevere?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Because the people are nice?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Because you've made some friends here,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and you don't want to lose that?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Or do you recognize that the word of God is life?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   In Romans 10, verse 17, it says,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   "For faith comes from hearing,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and the hearing of the word of Christ."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's the word of Christ that you heard that caused you to live.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And it is human arrogance to think
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   that we were absolutely dependent upon his mercy to be saved.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   The Bible says that we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   A dead person doesn't have a thought.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   A dead person doesn't have a will.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   A dead person doesn't have a plan.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   A dead person is just there until somebody resuscitates.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And that's what happened to all of us.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   That's how the Bible describes our salvation.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And so if we were once dead and made alive
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   because God had mercy on us,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   why do we all of a sudden think
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   that if we apply different methods
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   that we can resuscitate people?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   If we try different tricks,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   if we try different methods, different organization,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   that this will somehow bring more people to Christ?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   The Bible says, "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Some people will respond, and some people will not.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But you will never do more than what God has ordained
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   in the preaching of the word of God.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   You will never do more than that.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   We can always--
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Again, there's nothing wrong with any of this stuff,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   but when we begin to think that somehow that is the answer,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   that's when we get into trouble.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   See, I read a book several years ago
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   about this Jewish professor
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   who was backpacking in Europe.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And as he was backpacking in Europe,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   the rain started coming, and he was by himself,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and he saw through the window
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   there's a bunch of people gathered together.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   He thought, "Maybe I'll run in here for a little bit,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and if they would let me, I'll stay there for a little bit,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   and then when the rain stops, I'm going to go out."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   So he knocked on the door, and he went in,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and he said, "Hey, come in.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   You know, we're actually having a Bible study.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   You're more than welcome to sit in."
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   So he said, "Okay, I'll sit here, you know,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   listen to these religious fanatics, you know,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   for a bit, and then I'll leave."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   He comes in, and they're having a Bible study,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and they start reading Isaiah 53.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Now, he doesn't know.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   He doesn't have a Bible, and again, he's a nominal Jew,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   so he really didn't know his Old Testament.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   So when he heard Isaiah 53 being quoted,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   he immediately thought it was the New Testament,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   and he stopped him.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   He said, "Wait a second.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   You know, I told you I'm a Jew,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   and I know it's your Bible study,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   but I just need to let you know that to me it's offensive
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   because I don't believe in the New Testament."
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   To his surprise, one of the men in the Bible study said,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   "This was not the New Testament we quoted.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   We quoted the Old Testament, Isaiah 53."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   He's like, "What?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Clearly that has to be about Christ."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And so he took the Bible.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Sure enough, he read Isaiah 53,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and it was in the Old Testament.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And that whole book is about this testimony of his conversion
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   and how he went back home, and it rocked his world.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And he started to read through the Bible,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and he realized that Christ was in the Old Testament.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And again, as a Jewish professor,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and I tried so hard to look for that book yesterday,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and I couldn't find it.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   If I find it, I'll bring it next week.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   But the whole testimony was about this man
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   who was confronted with the truth of God's Word,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and he was saved.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   He says all Scripture is God-breathed, all of it.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   In Psalm 33, 6, "By the word of the Lord,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   all their hosts."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   The word all Scripture is God-breathed.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Now, when we look at this passage and say,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   "Well, you say all Scripture,"
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   by the time Paul is writing this letter,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   there is no New Testament canon.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   And some of you guys who may have studied church history
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   a little bit will say, "You know, that happened
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   in the Council of Carthage in 386 A.D.,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   so that's not what Paul is referring to.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   He's probably referring only to the Old Testament."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Well, if you--again, we're not going to do
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   a whole study on this, but you'll notice
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   that even in the writing of the New Testament,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   they already are receiving from the get-go
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   that the letters that they are sending out
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and the letters they are receiving
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   is already God's Word, Scripture.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I'm going to give you a couple of these.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   In 1 Timothy 5:18, Paul--again, just listen carefully.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   You don't need to turn there.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   1 Timothy 5:18, Paul says, "For the Scripture says,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   'You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   and the laborer deserves his wages.'"
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   So Paul is quoting Scripture to talk about
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   how people in ministry ought to be supported.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But if you look at that passage carefully,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   he quotes two passages.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   The first one, "You shall not muzzle an ox
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   when it treads out," that passage comes from
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Deuteronomy 25, verse 4, which is the Old Testament.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   The second part of it where it says,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   "The laborer deserves his wages,"
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   is not in the Old Testament.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   That's actually a direct quote from Luke 10, verse 7.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   That does not exist in the Old Testament.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   So in other words, Paul was quoting
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   the Old and the New Testament, Luke 10, 7,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   equivalent to the Old Testament Scripture.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   So Paul was already recognizing
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   that the canon is being written.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   In fact, in 2 Peter 3.16, Peter talks about
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   how people are distorting the Word of God,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and he says, "As they do to many others,"
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   and he calls Paul's writing Scripture.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   So Peter recognizes.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   And when Paul oftentimes writes his letter
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   and he sends it out, he says,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   "This comes with the authority of Christ,"
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   and he tells them to have it read
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   in all the other churches.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   This was not just simply a personal letter
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   from him to that one particular church.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   He says, "This is meant to be read
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   from church to church."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And again, we can go on and on.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   2 Corinthians 10.10, remember that passage
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   where Paul says they're questioning
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   his apostleship?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   And so they're saying, "You know, this guy,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   his letters are impressive.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   It comes with much authority.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's strong.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   But when he comes in person, he is weak."
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And I think the reason why his letters
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   were coming with such authority
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   was because it was inspired by the breath of God.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   So his letters were coming with,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   But when he showed up, he was a short, bald guy.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Apollos was a better speaker than him.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   So he says his letters come with authority,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   but this guy is not impressive
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   because his letters were coming
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   with the breath of God.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   See, when we're talking about the breath of God,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   because literally that's what it means,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   that God breathed out his word.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   The image that I get is the image of resuscitation.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   If somebody has a heart attack,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   what is the first thing that we do?
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   CPR, right?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   We do CPR, and then we do mouth-to-mouth.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And the reason why we're taught mouth-to-mouth
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   is to have your breath go into that person
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   so that they can breathe.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   That's the image that we see in Scripture,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   where God has put his breath into the word of God
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   so that those who are dead in their trespasses
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   may be exposed to his breath,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and his breath resuscitates you,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   opens your eyes, and revives you.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And that's why he tells his church
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   not to stray away from this,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   because the power of you going out and evangelizing
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   is not your method.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It's like, "Oh, we need to be better trained to do this.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   We need to be better trained out in China.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   We need to be better trained out on campus."
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   In the end, the core of what God has given us
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   is his word.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And then, again, the danger is when we get into ministry
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and try to bear fruit, it's like, "Oh, it's not bearing fruit
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   the way that we want it to bear fruit."
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And then we start to think, "Okay, maybe there's something else.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Maybe it's the organization.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Maybe it's the music.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   If we had more contemporary music,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   more people will come.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Maybe if we had worship earlier or later.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Maybe if we had home Bible study instead of church Bible study.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Maybe if we did evangelism.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Maybe if we went to China or India or somewhere else.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Maybe if we did all of these things, that somehow
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   this is going to bring revival, and it's going to produce
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   what we want.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And that is a danger that we get into
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   where we begin to think that if we apply different methods
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   that other people have done, that somehow
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   we're going to be more successful.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   When the lesson in the Bible is clear,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   do not turn from the Word of God to the left or to the right.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   This is His very breath.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   If you and I got saved, because we're completely helpless,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   and the Word of God came, and that's exactly what God
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   has ordained to bring people to Christ.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   He said, "My sheep, they hear My voice,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and they will follow Me."
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   See, when we use methods, they'll come to the church.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   When you use programs and do all this,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   they'll say, "Oh, this church has all this program."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And they'll have confidence in the program.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   You know, when you, "Oh, if you preach this way,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   if you organize this way," they're going to say,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   "That church, I like this church because this church
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   is this way, because the people are nice,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   and because that."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And they will be attracted to the people.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   They will be attracted to the program.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   They will be attracted to whatever it is,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   the organization you have.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   They will not be attracted to Christ.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "To My sheep, they will hear My voice,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   and they will follow Me."
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And that's why he tells Paul.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Paul tells Timothy to continue in this.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And I'm going to do one more thing before we open up
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   the communion table.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   He says, "Because it is profitable for teaching."
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Now, I'm going to do this one, and I'm going to save
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   the rest for next time.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   For teaching.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   The word for teaching in the Greek,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   there's two different words.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   There's didache and didaskalia.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Didache is the main word that is used to talk about
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   a set of truth, doctrine.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Didaskalia is the act of teaching, instructing.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   So if you notice that in their translations,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   if you have the King James or New King James,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   it says it is profitable for doctrine.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   If you have NASV, NIV, ESV, majority of your
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   translations will say it is profitable for teaching.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And the reason why it's that is because majority
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   of the translators believe that this word is not
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   referring to a set of doctrine.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Of course, if you want to know what to believe
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   as a Christian, of course you have to come to
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   the Word of God.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   But the word that is used here is not didache,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   but didaskalia.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And the word didaskalia basically means
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   the act of instructing.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   The act of disciple making.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And what that means is, he's not referring to
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   just your thinking.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   The Word of God is profitable.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Because that's the way I understood it for years.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   That if you want to know the truth,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   the Word of God, you have to study the Word of God.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   You have to dissect the Word of God.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And all of a sudden you have these truths.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And that's why you go to seminary,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   to understand these truths.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   And if you know these truths,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and you're able to disseminate these truths,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   then you are equipped for every good work.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And that's, again, that's what I thought this meant.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   But that's not what this word means at all.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   The word teaching is, when he says at the end of this,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   in verse 17, he said, "All of this, for teaching,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   for reproof, for correcting, for training in righteousness,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   for every good work."
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Now, this is directly linked to our ordination today.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   In our church, we don't ordain people
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   because they got a degree.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Or because they're skilled, necessarily,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   in particular things.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Because the scripture doesn't give that as a criteria.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Ultimately.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   If you look at the criteria of an elder or a deacon,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   it's all character.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Who they are.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And so, when he's talking about scripture,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   training you, teaching you, rebuking you,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   correcting you for the work, for good works,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   he's talking about a man who has been deeply affected
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   by the Word of God.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   The teaching that he's talking about, instruction,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Psalm 32, verse 8, the Word of God is a lamp unto our path.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   It instructs us on how we ought to live.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   In Romans 12, 2, the Word of God causes us to think,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   change the paradigm.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   So, not only instructs us our life,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   it instructs the way we think.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And then in Hebrews chapter 4, 12,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   it instructs our thinking and our heart.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   The Word of God is living act to sharpen any double-edged sword,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   is able to judge, divide between bone and marrow,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   between spirit and soul,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of our hearts.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   So, the Word of God, the instruction, gives all of it.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Not just the way we live, not just the way we think,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   but the way we feel.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   So, when he's talking about the Word of God is useful,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   profitable for instruction,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   he's talking about to make a man the way God desires him to be.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   So, when the Bible says that the calling of an elder,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   that he has all these inner qualities,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   and he's able to teach,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   able to teach is not just referring to,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   does he have knowledge and can he disseminate this knowledge?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Anybody who can talk can do that.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Right? I mean, all of you have studied.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   You've studied just as much as any seminary student does.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Right? You get a degree in medicine and law.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   You know, some of you guys have probably studied much more
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   than any seminary students will have.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Right?
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Anybody who can study and memorize
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   and can talk a little bit, right, can talk.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   That's not what he's talking about.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   He's talking about an individual who has been,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   who has been exposed to the breath of God
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   and who has been sanctified.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   They have been rebuked, have been corrected.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Because I can say the right things,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   but if my heart is wrong, I could be dead wrong.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Preaching the word of God is not just disseminating information.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's speaking with the heart of God,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   speaking with the mind of God,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   speaking with the life of God.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And that's why he says the word of God is profitable
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   for all of these things.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Again, I'm going to wrap this up,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   and we're going to open up the communion table this morning.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Again, there are times, there are seasons,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   when what we're doing here is just not going to be popular.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And I've seen it.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Again, I haven't lived long,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   but I've been in ministry long enough to know
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   that I can do the exact same thing,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and it was so effective 15 years ago
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and is not effective today.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And then there are some certain things that,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   you know, it's just like people could care less.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And all of a sudden, there's an appetite.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   When we first started this church,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   there was no appetite for God's word.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   There was no appetite, because people would come to me,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and say, "Peter, your preaching is, eh."
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   You know, I remember the earlier,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   the younger ones in our church,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   and they were just bored out of their mind,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   because on Friday nights, all we did was exposit the Book of Romans.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   And they said, "How come we're not playing tennis?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   How come we're not--"
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   I don't have time, you know,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   so I only have time to do one thing a week
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   and one thing on Sunday.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   So we're going to get into the Word of God,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   and we're going to teach the Word of God.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   So if I did New Testament on Friday,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   we're going to do Old Testament on Sunday.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And that was it.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Not popular at all.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   People would come, and everything was cutting edge.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   You know, it's like, "Oh, that church is doing this,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   and that church is growing, and your church is not growing,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   because you're not doing this, and you're not doing that."
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   And I, again, by that time,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I've already been in ministry long enough to know
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   that whatever that produces, I don't want it.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Even if it causes the church to grow, I don't want it,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   because I grew up in a pastor's family.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   I know what it's like to be
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   in a--even in a large church
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   that's not healthy, you know.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   So if you have more people at church
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   who are there for the wrong reason,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   you have more people complaining.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   You have more drama. So I don't want it.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Why would you want that? Why would I want to be a pastor over that?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   So I say, even if we don't grow,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   even if it's not popular,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   that's one thing I was convicted in.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   God gave us His Word.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   And whatever happens in the church,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   whether it grows or doesn't grow, whether we end up
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   folding, it's going to happen because
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   of the Word of God.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And I'm not going to turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   That has
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   not changed.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And I don't believe it will ever change.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Because the Word of God will not change.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   And so today,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   we may look at it and say, "Oh, there's an appetite.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   People want to come because they want to hear the Word of God.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Oh, it's not being taught."
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   That may not be the case for the
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   rest of our lives.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   It may come a time when doing exactly
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   what we're doing now, people are going to
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   say, "Ah, you're preaching too long.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   You shouldn't do that. Maybe if you tried
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   this, maybe if you tried that." And I'm telling
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   you now, it's not
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   going to change. And again,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   one, because I'm stubborn. I know I'm stubborn.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Second, but more
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   importantly, that's what the Word of God says.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And so my desire for our church is
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   the same. That you would
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   recognize that the
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   life is in His Word.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   That you don't come to church because
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   you're attached to people. I mean, that's great if you're attached
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   to people. You don't come to church thinking like, "If we did
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   this, we could do more of this." No.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   First and foremost,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and strength by how?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Coming to His Word.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   And don't think
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   that you coming and hearing my Word
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   is enough because you're always getting it second
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   hand, right? Imagine
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   what kind of relationship I would have with my wife
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Esther if I had to constantly ask you,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   "What do you think?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Why is she so angry today?"
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   What kind of relationship do you think
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   I'll have with her if I have to ask
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   you, right? "What's
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   going on with Esther?"
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   You know, "What's going on?" "Can you tell
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   her I don't like that?"
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   What kind of relationship would I have
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   if everything, every communication, every relationship
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   I had, I have to go through somebody else?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   There's nothing wrong with you receiving, but
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   if that's the only feeding that you get,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   that's the kind of relationship that you're going to have.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   So I encourage you,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   come to the Word of God.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   This is
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   supplemental. This is encouragement
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   for you to come
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   to the Word of God and hear from Him directly
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and not turn from it to the left
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   or to the right.
