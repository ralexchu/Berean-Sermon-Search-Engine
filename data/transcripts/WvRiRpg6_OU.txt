[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   - Hi, my name is Tim Tang,
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   and I'll be sharing my testimony today.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   I'm the youngest boy, and only boy of three,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   and I grew up in a single mother household
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   while visiting my father on occasion.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.120]   The messiness of the divorce left a lasting wound
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.120]   in the whole family, me included.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   Throughout elementary school,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   my parents would take me to church habitually.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.120]   I did the usual Christian kid experience,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.120]   BBS, Sunday school, et cetera.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   Even so, I did not understand what was going on around me,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   and that feeling changed when my parents left to China.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   They did it for separate reasons.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.120]   I began hopping around different auntie, uncles' houses,
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   church parents, and at this time,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   my youth group pastor took a stint taking care of me
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   and introduced me to Christ.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   I bought into the idea that Christ is my savior
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   and started attending church due to the overwhelming love
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   that my pastor shared with me.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   However, my understanding of Christ
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   was not founded on the Bible.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   I had my own understanding of the Bible
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   that would lead me astray throughout high school
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   while living in sin,
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   whether it was drinking, drugs, partying.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   I became reliant on false pretenses I had of Christ,
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   that Christ wanted me to succeed,
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   that I suffered enough through life,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.120]   and Christ will pour his care over me in the way I desired.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   In actuality, though, I lived two lives,
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   the church me and secular me.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   I was serving two masters.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.120]   Before my freshman year of college,
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   these misconceptions of the Lord came to a head,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   and I noticed the holes in my faith.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   I started to look for the meaning of my faith in the word
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   and trusted false teachers of the word.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   I became involved with Shincheonji,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   a Korean cult led by Man-hee Lee.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   Their knowledge of the word
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   surpassed anyone I met thus far
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   and is still better than most brothers and sisters I know.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   In reality, they twisted the word
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120]   by discrediting the Holy Spirit
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.120]   and instead claiming their church
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   is the only church that has the truth.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   John 14.26 says,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   "But the advocate, the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   "whom the Father will send in my name,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   "will teach you all things
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.120]   "and will remind you of everything I have said to you."
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   For a year, I unknowingly learned
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   how to cherry-pick the word and twist the word
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   to take the Holy Spirit out of the equation
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   and replace it with false teachings.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   My experience with the cult soured continually
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   as my intimacy with the Lord lessened.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   By the grace and guidance of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   I started to find small holes in their arguments,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   inconsistencies from other verses,
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   and I left the cult unsure of where I stood with my faith
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   and where was God in all of this.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   I wondered why God led me down this road
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   that would make me question his existence.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   I would look at my previous experiences of my faith
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   and the word with a sour feeling
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   that was impressed to me by the cult.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   I decided to forego my relationship with the Lord
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   due to this turmoil.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   I did everything in my power
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   to fill a Christ-shaped hole in my heart.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   I started an extremely successful business
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.120]   selling computer components.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.120]   I went back to drinking
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   and forsook my connection with the church.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   I lived amidst my sin for a year and a bit,
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.120]   hoping my pain and guilt would go away.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.120]   I thought I could live a life content
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   with the omission of Christ.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   But when quarantine started, my business was shut down,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   and I was alone with myself in my apartment in Irvine,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.120]   and I went crazy a little bit
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.120]   just from staying home by myself.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   However, I had time to reflect on my spiritual health,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   and nothing could fill or fit the role
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   of being the center of my life.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   My greed, my deception, pride, envy, malice,
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120]   the list goes on.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   It all tried and failed to be the center,
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   and it all came from a heart that was too scared
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   to put its faith in Christ.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   However, as much as I could draw myself
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   in the world's pleasure,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   I could not escape the facts laid out in the world
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   that Christ is still searching for me,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   knocking on my door,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   beckoning me to trust in him and in him alone.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   The Almighty God, who has died for my transgressions against him,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   is still holding on to me,
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   that my sins pale in comparison
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   to what God has done for me.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   This broke me in every single way possible.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   I never thought I would consider myself Christian again
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   in my life, but my only response was to go back
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   and find him again.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   I started reading the word again,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   so I'd go back to church,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   and my brothers and sisters at Berne
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   encouraged me to look through the word myself,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.120]   not rely on others or my salvation
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.120]   or other people's teachings.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   Through God's endless grace and gentle guidance
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   and many loving rebukes,
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   I learned how to read and apply the word in my life
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   and it's led to a true understanding
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   of what Christ has done,
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   that he calls me to surrender all I am,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   not just my sin.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.120]   I finally understand that Christ is my Lord and Savior.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.120]   I have found my hope, my faith, my love
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   in the aftermath of the cross.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   I still have much to grow,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   but I finally understand my calling
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   to continue to love my God with all I am,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   sin, brokenness, and all.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   I am no longer lost amidst the solution of the word
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   and that Christ has loved me all this time.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   Thank you.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   [applause]

[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.120]   [applause continues]
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   [applause continues]
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   (audience applauds)
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   (audience applauds)
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.120]   mhm. (audience applauds)
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   (audience applauds)
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.120]   one, two, three. (audience applauds)
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:30:00.700]   (audience applauds)
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:12.820]   (audience applauds)
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.940]   All right, thank you Tim for that great testimony
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.700]   and getting me wet. (laughs)
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.900]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.320]   to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.600]   We're gonna finish up this text, verse 17 to 19.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:41.800]   First, Hebrews chapter 13, verse 17 to 19.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.860]   It says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.620]   "for they keep watch over your souls
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.160]   "as those who will give an account.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.220]   "Let them do this with joy and not with grief,
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.120]   "for this would be unprofitable for you.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.280]   "Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.620]   "desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.420]   "And I urge you all the more to do this
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.040]   "so that I may be restored to you sooner."
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.500]   Let's pray.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.160]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.580]   We pray that your word would illuminate us,
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.100]   help us to see a greater glimpse of who you are,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.640]   that we may submit ourselves, Lord God, to your word,
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.340]   and that your word and your glory
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.020]   would be at the center of this church.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.800]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:29.340]   I wanna read you a poem that I wrote when I was 23.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.800]   Okay, so it's been many years ago,
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.580]   and basically I wrote this in a period of discouragement
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.760]   just to kind of remind myself to give me strength
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   to persevere, and basically the poem goes like this.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.760]   I have come too far to retreat, to remain in my defeat.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.960]   I have no other paths to take,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.700]   for there are too many things at stake.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.920]   My soul thirsts to see the only king
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.760]   to finally know the joy and peace he'll bring.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.680]   The light will fill the darkness everywhere.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.720]   Nothing that I know will compare,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.100]   though I've fallen more than I can remember.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.560]   My thoughts go back to that night in December
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.520]   when my soul was snatched from the fire
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.260]   and the only king filled all my desires.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.480]   Not by works, but by grace I will meet.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.520]   I've come too far to retreat.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.840]   I don't even remember the context in writing that,
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.240]   but I do remember the discouragement
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.880]   and thinking to myself, just kicking and screaming,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.720]   like I don't want to do pastoral ministry.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.080]   I'll be a missionary, I'll be on campus,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.920]   and I'll do whatever else, but pastoral ministry.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.640]   'Cause every pain and every bad memory
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.160]   that I have with childhood was somehow connected to church
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.360]   because my dad was a pastor.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.600]   And so when I knew going in that that was gonna come,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.400]   but when it actually started happening,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.720]   and the discouragement started to come,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.580]   the interpersonal relational conflict started to come,
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.000]   it wasn't just about that thing.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.040]   It was just all the stuff that I remember
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   was am I ready for this?
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.080]   Do I want to take my kids through this?
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.320]   Do I want to take my wife in this?
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.760]   And so as I was wrestling through that,
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.160]   I just, back then I used to write songs and write poems,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.140]   and I haven't done that in years.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.120]   But as I was writing that, looking back at it now,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.600]   only if I knew what was coming,
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.560]   I wouldn't have been able to persevere.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   But what I'm thankful for is that
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.580]   because I saw it in my parents,
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.560]   that at least I had some inkling, I had some idea.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.240]   I wasn't necessarily caught off guard.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.640]   It didn't make it easy,
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.220]   but at least I knew what was coming.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.760]   I knew what I was getting into.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.000]   Many, many years have gone by since then.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.160]   30 years have gone by since I wrote that poem,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.000]   30 some years.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.040]   And again, by God's providence,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.120]   he only gives you enough to know at that moment.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.880]   If you know what's coming,
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.720]   like how many of us would be able to persevere,
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.560]   whatever it is that you're doing,
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.640]   God gives us the strength that we need
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.520]   to persevere at that moment.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.940]   As we were going through this text,
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.880]   obviously we started out by understanding
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.720]   the biblical calling of leaders in the church,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.160]   the very high calling in the church.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.480]   And so we take this very, very seriously,
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.600]   sometimes to the point where people are frustrated
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.920]   that we need to have a very high view of the church.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.200]   Doesn't mean that the leadership is perfect,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.400]   that they don't make mistakes,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.920]   but at least by our standard,
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.120]   we need to have a very high standard.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.080]   'Cause if the leaders are compromised,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.760]   automatically the church will be compromised.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.720]   Along with that, he said,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.040]   if the leaders are committed to that,
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.960]   the congregation needs to commit to the leadership.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.840]   And so last week we looked at to obey and submit.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.280]   Obey and submit basically means to place yourself under,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.320]   make it easier for them to lead you
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.680]   and sacrifice for you and pray for you,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.840]   'cause it is to your benefit
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.920]   because God has put the leaders in charge
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.600]   to watch over the souls of the congregation.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.760]   Today's sermon is a lot more personal
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.540]   because I'm basically asking for prayer this morning.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.460]   I'm very encouraged that we have a church
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.660]   that's praying for our leadership.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.260]   I get an email from our sister Helen once a month,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.600]   representing the family ministry saying,
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.040]   "Hey, you have any prayer requests?"
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.280]   And so most of the prayer requests that I give
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.360]   is probably looks the same as the previous months
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.760]   because a lot of things that we get entangled with
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.960]   is kind of hard to share.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.560]   And so we have to sift through what can I share,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.600]   what can I not share?
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.040]   But today I wanted to share,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.800]   representing all the leadership,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.080]   and this is not just us,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.600]   so that you can kind of get a better glimpse
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.880]   of what leadership struggles with.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.200]   And so that when you do pray for us,
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.380]   you can pray for us in more detail, more accurately.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.620]   The prayer request falls into two categories here.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.580]   When Paul says in verse 18,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.040]   "Pray for us for we are sure that we have a good conscience
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.440]   "desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things."
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.780]   So the first thing is to pray for our own sanctification.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.640]   Pray for the sanctification and maturity and growth
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.800]   and wrestling with sins in ourselves first,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.640]   in the leadership.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.840]   And then the second part,
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.760]   when he says in verse 19,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.680]   "Pray for us for we are sure that we have a good conscience
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   "desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things."
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.040]   When he says to praying for,
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   that they would have a good conscience,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.280]   he's not just saying that we should pray for ourselves,
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.360]   he's saying that we should pray for ourselves
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.200]   in all things.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.800]   So the first part, when he says,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   "Pray for us for we are sure that we have a good conscience
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.840]   "desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things."
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.120]   When he says to praying for,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.880]   to praying for that they would have a good conscience,
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.200]   and then he says to conduct ourselves honorably
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.040]   in all things,
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.400]   he's talking about sanctification inside and out.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.720]   On the surface, because this is our job,
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.800]   we have to study the Bible.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   We have to do counseling, we do evangelism,
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.880]   and so everything that pertains to running the church,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.800]   we can do.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.620]   And be completely a different person internally.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   In fact, Pharisees were the godliest people on the surface,
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.760]   probably more than majority of the people in our generation.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.760]   They studied the Bible more than,
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.240]   they memorized the Bible,
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.760]   they went witnessing,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.360]   they gave, they tithed,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.160]   they did everything that you're supposed to,
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.480]   they prayed, they fasted.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.320]   And yet when Jesus rebuked them,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.480]   he said, "You are no different than a whitewashed tomb."
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.600]   Meaning that on the surface,
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.440]   you clean it so that it looks beautiful,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.240]   but inside it's just filled with dead men's bones.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.920]   On the surface, as a job,
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.320]   we can preach and teach and evangelize and counsel
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.000]   and do all that thing,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.700]   but if we're not careful,
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.940]   we can ignore our conscience.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.800]   Where we can do all these things and make disciples,
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.400]   but inwardly we are filled with pride,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.760]   greed, bitterness,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.880]   anger, slander,
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.240]   and we excuse all of that
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.680]   because people don't know about that.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.320]   If I don't tell you, if we don't confess it,
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.280]   you would not know.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.800]   If I don't share that and ask for prayers,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.700]   you wouldn't know.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.260]   So we can do the work on the external
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.480]   because we're concerned because there's immediate consequences
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.780]   if we don't get the external things correctly
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.680]   while ignoring our conscience.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.000]   Paul says, "Pray for us,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   "because we are trying hard to have a good conscience
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.560]   "and desiring with all our might to conduct honorably."
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.240]   This is one thing that you just cannot do
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.820]   unless there is righteousness inside and outside.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:01.760]   Everybody, I mean, you guys are all in different fields.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.440]   If you're a business owner,
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.320]   there's a special kind of skill that you need
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.920]   to make the food, to advertise,
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.040]   to manage the money, manage the workers,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.840]   and especially during the pandemic,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.760]   you had all kinds of things that you needed to do
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.160]   in order to keep it running.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.760]   Well, on the surface, the church is no different.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.320]   I don't think on the surface the church is more difficult
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.200]   'cause there's a lot of things
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.800]   that we can do on the surface, right?
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.520]   If you're a good manager, if you're good with people,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.840]   maybe you're a good teacher, right?
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.580]   We can do all of these things.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.180]   But you cannot bear fruit because the Bible says
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.040]   that you cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.440]   Unless there is an abiding that is taking place
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.920]   in the leadership, in conscience, and in conduct,
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.960]   he says you cannot bear fruit.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.320]   We can fake it.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.600]   We can get you to maybe thank us and adore us,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.680]   but the real fruit that comes from the conviction
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.200]   of the Holy Spirit isn't going to happen
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.600]   unless the leaders themselves
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.440]   have a clear conscience before God, inside and out.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.660]   Paul says in Acts 24, verse 16,
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.720]   "In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.460]   "a blameless conscience before God and before men."
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.680]   And then in 1 Peter 3, 16, it says,
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.340]   "Keep a good conscience so that in the thing
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.620]   "in which you are slandered,
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.540]   "those who revile your good behavior in Christ
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.240]   "will be put to shame."
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.360]   He said the reason why leaders have to be above reproach
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.880]   is because we have the job,
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.320]   and again, this isn't unique to us.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.920]   The whole church, every single Christian
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.480]   is called to make disciples,
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.960]   but the leaders are to be an example of this.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.400]   So we have the job of proclaiming the gospel
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.760]   that basically tells the world
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.260]   that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.920]   that you need to repent and humble yourself before this king
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.960]   and until you turn from the empty way of life,
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.560]   there is no salvation, there is no hope beyond this life.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.360]   So if you believe that,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.440]   then I've turned you away from your sin to eternal life,
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   but if you do not believe that,
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.720]   then I've offended you
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.060]   'cause I just call your whole way of life empty,
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.280]   that you are deep in sin
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.840]   and that there is eternal judgment waiting for you.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.560]   So this message that we've been given
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.740]   to preach to this fallen world
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.760]   is a very offensive message if they do not believe,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.120]   if they do not receive it.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.560]   So because if the people do not receive it,
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.280]   the natural response is going to be,
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.960]   well, who the heck are you to tell me that?
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.120]   So we invite criticism.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.400]   We invite reviling.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.140]   I think maybe another way to put it is
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.880]   if somebody comes into your room early in the morning
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.440]   and they flip the light on, right, it's still dark,
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.700]   five in the morning, they flip the light on,
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.920]   how will you respond?
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.560]   It depends, right?
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.440]   You have a job at 5.30 and if you don't get there in time,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.520]   then you're gonna lose this job.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.840]   So if somebody comes in and flicks the light on, thank you
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   'cause if you didn't do that, I would've just slept through
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.120]   and I would've lost this job.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.400]   You may respond that way depending on the context
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.820]   and what you believe and why they did that.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.000]   But let's say it's Saturday morning,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.840]   you know what I mean?
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.480]   And you woke up early all week
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.560]   and then the only day you have to sleep in is Saturday
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.760]   and maybe the person flicking the light on forgot
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.280]   that was the case and they flipped the light on.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   How would you respond?
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.920]   Thank you, I know you meant well.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.360]   Okay, can you please turn that off, right?
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.400]   Maybe.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.340]   What are you doing?
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.520]   Especially if that's your sibling, right?
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.720]   Saturday's the only day I was about to sleep
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.640]   in the best dream of my life and you woke me up.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.200]   What are you doing?
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.540]   You jerk, right?
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.680]   The kind of response that you're gonna get
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.800]   when the light gets turned on, it depends
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.100]   on what the light does for you.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.280]   Does it wake you up to save you,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.560]   to get you to the place you need to go?
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.080]   Or is it disturbing you or where you want to stay?
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.580]   That's exactly what the gospel does.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.040]   When you turn the light on, it'll cause you
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   to get you to move from where you are to somewhere else.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.440]   But if you don't want to move, the gospel is very disturbing.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.480]   It's irritating, it's offensive.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.720]   And so because of that, if the elders were called
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.600]   to preach the gospel, flick the light on,
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.360]   some people will thank us and many will find ways
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.440]   to accuse us.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.600]   So if the leaders of the church are not above reproach
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.240]   and that thing gets turned around and say,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.320]   well, look at you, and if any of that sticks,
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.360]   they nullify the message because they've nullified
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.320]   the messenger.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.360]   In 1 Timothy 1.5, it says, but the goal
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.280]   of our instruction is love.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.120]   The goal of our instruction is love.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   Right before this text, Apostle Paul tells Timothy
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.200]   to go fight against his false teachers,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.640]   command them to stop teaching these false doctrines.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   So he's telling Timothy to gear up for this fight.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.560]   But as he is commanding him to do that,
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.160]   he says, remember that even in the midst of this fight,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.840]   the goal of it is love.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.440]   Goal of it, the reason why we're fighting
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.320]   is so that we can establish love.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   But he says, but from a pure heart and a good conscience
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.480]   and a sincere faith.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.680]   In order to be effective in this struggle
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.360]   to keep the truth, we need to have our eyes
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.800]   on the reason why we're doing that,
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.480]   that Christ came and says what characterized us
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.240]   as disciples of Christ is love.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.040]   And what I've experienced through the years
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.520]   is when I'm not doing right
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.840]   and I don't have a clear conscience,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.800]   the first thing that is impossible to do
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.840]   is to love people.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:04.520]   It takes every ounce of energy in me
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.080]   because it takes so much out to love people
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.560]   that I don't want to love.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.440]   It's easy to seek justice.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.560]   You did me wrong, so you deserve this.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.440]   It's easy to do that, right?
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.640]   You hurt me, so I'm gonna hurt you
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.040]   'cause that's our natural reflex.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.680]   But to pray for them, to seek what's best,
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.320]   to do your best to love them,
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.600]   it goes against my nature.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.320]   So it's nothing more humbling
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.200]   that we can do in the flesh than to love somebody
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.640]   that you do not want to love.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.240]   It requires a good conscience.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.240]   I don't know how many times I'm on my knees
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.680]   just being broken because everything in my flesh
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.240]   is fighting against this.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.280]   But I know that if I don't practice this,
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.960]   that whatever sermon that I give, that I'm a fake.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.400]   I present the facade of loving Christ,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.320]   that this is the most important thing,
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.360]   and it's with my mouth, but not with my life.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.440]   There's a huge difference between a sermon
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.600]   that you hear from the mouth
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.680]   versus a sermon you hear from their life.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.240]   And a leader cannot do this until his conscience is clear,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.520]   inside and out.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.320]   Now who's able to do this?
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.560]   This calling for the leadership in the church
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.680]   is not something that we can muster up.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.120]   Are there just few good men
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.400]   who just happen to be good in soul,
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.240]   who just happen to be better in intellect,
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.760]   who has more courage than the average person?
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.920]   It's beyond us.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.000]   We're just like you.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.040]   And sometimes because we're in ministry
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.120]   and we have this title of leader or whatever it may be,
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.840]   you're a pastor.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.080]   It's like, oh, your family's like this
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:51.960]   'cause you're a pastor.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.360]   Oh, you struggle, you don't do this,
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.840]   'cause you're a pastor.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.640]   So a lot of times we have to tell our elders,
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.200]   sometimes they follow you more than they follow us
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.800]   because our life looks different, right?
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.960]   But we're not any different.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.000]   Every temptation you struggle with, I struggle with.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.880]   You want the best things for your kids, so do we.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:19.600]   You wanna live in a nice house instead of a shack, me too.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.360]   Right?
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.600]   You don't want your cars breaking down
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.160]   in the middle of the road, me neither.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.720]   I wanna make sure that there's enough to retire on.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.680]   I wanna make sure that my wife is taken care of,
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.920]   my kids are taken care of,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.720]   that I have stuff to leave behind them.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.480]   You struggle with that, you're tempted by it, so am I.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:40.920]   I have to constantly fight against my own flesh.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.240]   And I'm not saying any of that stuff is wrong,
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.120]   but that's not our priority.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.920]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.560]   and it says all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.960]   I don't know how many times I've repeated that verse
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.040]   in my own head to fight my own flesh
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.640]   because I'm tempted.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.680]   I never, we didn't grow up with money,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.520]   so I grew up determined that I'm gonna make money
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:14.240]   to make it easier for my mom and for my dad.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.120]   And I remember as a young kid promising,
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.240]   we're gonna make sure that you ride limousine
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.440]   and you're gonna get your Cadillac.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.720]   I know Cadillac is not popular now.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.200]   Today's version was I'm gonna buy you the best Tesla.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.360]   We're gonna make sure 'cause you suffered enough.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.520]   Just like a lot of the kids do, we did the same thing.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.640]   But when we decided to go into ministry,
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.080]   we have to wrestle with that.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.360]   And I had to go against all the promises.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.040]   I had to let that go and give it in God's hand.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.960]   But the temptation has never gone away.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.720]   I never thought that I would,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.560]   'cause I don't feel like I'm materialistic.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.280]   I think if I went into business,
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.080]   I would've been obsessed.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.320]   That's just my personality.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.520]   But I don't have this longing to live in a big house.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.080]   In fact, my dream is, Esther knows,
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.280]   is to live in a van.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:19.720]   Have very little clutter and then just move
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.320]   and just wake up in the morning at the beach.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.160]   That's my dream.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.080]   So I don't have this big vision of I want nice things.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:32.520]   But after you have kids, it's different.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.320]   'Cause it's not just me.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.360]   I want my wife to have nice things.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.120]   I want my kids to have nice things.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.440]   And I really remember when we started having kids,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.720]   the temptation, because we really had nothing.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.600]   Literally nothing.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.320]   We had to calculate even to buy groceries.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.440]   And then not having air conditioning in the car
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.640]   when my child was an infant.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.000]   And every time he rode that car,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.360]   he would come out just in sweat.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.640]   And I remember really wrestling with,
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.880]   I wish I had more money.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.760]   You know, and I had to fight.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.120]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.240]   And all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.800]   So throughout the years, I had to repeat that in my head
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   because the struggle and the temptation
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   to chase after that, you know, is always there.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.840]   It's not gone now.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.040]   You know, it's there.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.280]   But I know that this is not something you can do part-time.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.200]   Like either I believe it and give my life like Apostle Paul,
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.000]   or I do something else.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.240]   Paul says to Timothy, 1 Timothy 1:18,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.560]   this command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son,
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.680]   in accordance with the prophecies previously made
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.960]   concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.720]   He called Timothy to fight,
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.560]   not just to check in and check out.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.760]   So the temptation for us as pastors
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.280]   is to approach this like a job, you know?
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.460]   Like 'cause you get paid, you do certain things,
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.760]   and then so we do certain, we preach,
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.000]   and we manage the church, do counseling,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.040]   and we get paid, so that's how we take care of our family.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.640]   But this is not a ministry that you can do as a job.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.480]   This is a ministry where you have to be called.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.160]   That you need to be consumed with this,
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.640]   that there's nothing more important
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.680]   than to get the gospel out
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.920]   and to establish a church.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.200]   Sometimes you may eat well, sometimes you may not.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.280]   Sometimes the bills are paid, sometimes you are not.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.320]   But if our commitment to this is
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.840]   if we can take care of our family,
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.920]   then we'll do it, and if we can't, we can't.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   Then sooner or later, you're gonna end up walking away.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.080]   This is not something that you can do
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.760]   just by doing it as a job.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.340]   And after years and years of doing this,
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.660]   the temptation for that is very real, right?
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.140]   Especially now that the church is certain size
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.440]   and we have so many pastors
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.700]   and so many people volunteering and helping out,
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.680]   it just kind of runs, right?
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.540]   I don't have to strive in prayer
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.820]   to see that Sunday service was gonna happen.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:21.300]   I don't have to wrestle, and there's a sense of urgency
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.660]   to get you gathered because you're gonna come.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:28.120]   So the temptation is to just get it done, right?
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:32.820]   But I know when I'm sober
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.860]   that the urgency to get the gospel out is no different
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.740]   whether we are 1,000 or 10,
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.900]   whether 40 years ago or now.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.500]   It's just that there's a temptation for us to settle.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.640]   In fact, Paul says in 2 Timothy 4, 9-11,
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.660]   he says, "Make every effort to come to me,
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.260]   "for demons loving this present world
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.740]   "have deserted me and gone to Thessalonica."
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:02.340]   Crescent has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.100]   only Luke is with me.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.120]   This is the very last letter Paul wrote before he died.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.020]   You know, oftentimes we think of Paul
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.980]   going out planting all these churches
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.100]   and then he went out in glory.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:14.940]   He did it.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:19.260]   Some of the last letters that he wrote was very depressing.
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.420]   And for whatever the reason,
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.380]   I gravitate toward those letters the most,
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.780]   1 Corinthians and Timothy, 2 Timothy.
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.460]   Because I see a real man.
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:31.740]   I see a real struggle that he,
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.300]   you can almost say he's discouraged
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.780]   because they've all gone.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.980]   He said, "Only Luke is with me."
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.100]   And then he's telling his next generation young pastors,
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.960]   "And make sure this doesn't happen to you.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.000]   "Entrust to faithful men
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.720]   "who will be able to teach others also.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.400]   "Don't get entangled with civilian affairs
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.980]   "so that you may please the commanding officer."
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:51.980]   And he's begging with them.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.700]   He's saying this in the context with all these other people.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.620]   Demas is mentioned in Philemon as his co-worker.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.820]   He went through all these trials with him.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.540]   But he says they're about to go.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.060]   And that's why Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9, 26,
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.160]   "I run in such a way as not without aim.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.760]   "I box in such a way as not beating the air,
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.060]   "but I discipline my body and make it my slave
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.500]   "so that after I have preached to others,
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.200]   "I myself will not be disqualified."
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.500]   That's Apostle Paul writing that.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.940]   There's a man who was beaten, shipwrecked.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.320]   He was bitten by scorpions.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.740]   He was starving at some point.
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.300]   And you would think if anybody was sober,
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.860]   if anybody didn't struggle with him,
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.720]   he almost seemed like a Superman.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.860]   And he says, "After I preach to others,
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.280]   "I need to discipline my body, make it my slave,
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.740]   "because the temptation to compromise,
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.640]   "to give in, is real.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.800]   "We need your prayers, because this is beyond us.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.580]   "This is not something we can do by our own might,
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.180]   "because we found talented men.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.440]   "Oh, these men are more courageous than average people.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.500]   "We are not.
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.940]   "We're not more courageous.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.840]   "We are not smarter than other people.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.580]   "But God convicted us.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:17.400]   "He opened our eyes, showed us the glory
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.140]   "of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.640]   "and that Christ that we met,
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.480]   "we want to tell other people.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.280]   "It's not because we're more gifted.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.820]   "It wasn't because we are stronger.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.580]   "It's not because we're more disciplined.
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.280]   "It's just we were just convicted.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.740]   "So pray for us, that our conscience,
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.700]   "our life, inside and out, will be pleasing to the Lord.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:47.360]   "We are being sanctified, as you are being sanctified."
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.280]   Secondly, he says, "Pray for the work."
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.480]   Pray for the work.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.000]   Hebrews 13, 19, he says, "I urge you all the more
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.800]   "to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner."
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.000]   Now, I think this is a possible.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.800]   There's a lot of people who think it's Barnabas
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.720]   and various other people, but I've gone through this text
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.660]   verse by verse for about five or six times now,
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.760]   and I see traces of his thinking.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.560]   It may not be him.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.920]   Some people believe it is, and some people believe
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.000]   it's somebody else, but I'm gonna talk to you like it is.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.100]   Okay.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:24.140]   Apostle Paul had, he was just one-track mind.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:29.980]   Like, life or death, he needs to preach the gospel.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.440]   Life or death.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.000]   This man, who literally was sitting in prison,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.340]   and he ended up getting beheaded,
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.860]   and he had prophets from God, true prophets,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.180]   not fake prophets, right?
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.820]   Not prophets who just kind of say,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.100]   I got this impression, I got this.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.740]   There's a true prophet who is telling truth,
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.100]   told Paul, if you go to Jerusalem,
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.200]   you're gonna be bound and put into prison.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.740]   He says, not only am I willing to go to prison,
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.260]   I'm willing to die.
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.620]   And he got on that boat, and he went.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:03.740]   And he's sure, just as he said, he got bound,
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.900]   and he started spending his time in prison.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:11.460]   This man almost seems superhuman to us.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.120]   He says in Ephesians 6, 19, pray for boldness
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.520]   to preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.880]   If any man had boldness, you would think
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.680]   Apostle Paul had boldness, right?
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:27.660]   Can you think of another person who literally got stoned,
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.320]   dragged out to die, right?
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.640]   And he said, oh my gosh, the thought that somebody
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.400]   is gonna throw one pebble at you
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.840]   probably will keep us away from the doors closed
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.800]   in that village.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.120]   When we say, Lord, open the door for the gospel to enter,
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.160]   oftentimes we're praying for a red carpet to be thrown out.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.200]   We'll give you this money, all the food's ready,
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:55.240]   we have a church there, and here's a pulpit ready,
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.200]   and people are asking for you to come.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.680]   King's like, please open the door, right?
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.240]   This is a guy, when he says open the door,
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.360]   he's talking about people who's trying to kill me,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.040]   help me to stay safe so I can get over there.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:11.840]   And yet, he says, pray for boldness.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.560]   I think he's asking for boldness
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.260]   'cause he was struggling with that, 'cause he's human.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:22.800]   He remembers the pain of getting hit by rocks.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.560]   He remembers being, not having food to eat.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.040]   He remembers being shipwrecked, almost dying.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.760]   He remembers being whooped to the point of death.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:37.800]   And on top of all of that, his fellow countrymen,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.400]   and the very church that he spent,
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.760]   risked everything to plant in Corinth,
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.520]   was questioning, who are you?
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.360]   Simply because they didn't like what he had to say.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.200]   'Cause he came out hard in 1 Corinthians.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.920]   Shall I come to you with a whip?
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.080]   He said, who are you?
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.320]   Calling us out, who are you?
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.760]   You're not even an apostle.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.440]   Your letters are strong, but your presence is weak.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.200]   And you see 2 Corinthians, he's agonizing,
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.600]   trying to defend his apostleship to the very people
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.320]   that he risked his life to get the gospel to.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.960]   You think that didn't bother him?
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.040]   You think he just shrugged that off?
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.880]   I love Jesus, so it doesn't bother me?
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.280]   No.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.520]   He said he prayed to the Lord three times
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.720]   to take the thorn away from the side.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.080]   I think, and most commentators believe,
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.460]   that he's referring to his objectors.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:36.340]   People are constantly, and he says that in Philippians.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.160]   Some people preach Christ out of envy,
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.360]   just to make it harder for him.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.720]   Why would you do that?
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.200]   But Paul says people were doing that.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.480]   Other Christians, professing Christians,
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.720]   were simply preaching the gospel
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.440]   just to make it harder for him.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.240]   Do you think that didn't bother him?
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.040]   He's human.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.680]   You think he didn't agonize before that?
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.400]   And I think he agonized before the Lord.
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.660]   Please take that away.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.000]   I don't think he was talking about physical suffering.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.560]   I don't think it was just about being shipped there.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.120]   I think he's talking about the people that he loved,
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.840]   that he was agonizing over.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.540]   He says in Colossians 4, 3 to 4,
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.900]   praying at the same time for us as well,
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.960]   that God will open up for us the door for the word,
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.880]   so that we may speak from the mystery of Christ,
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.180]   for which I have been imprisoned,
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.780]   so that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.540]   The revelation is coming to him,
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.360]   and every pastor, every leader struggles with that.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.400]   We know what the word of God says,
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.960]   but how do I make this clear?
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.200]   Paul, the revelation is coming through him.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.320]   He says he's praying, make it clear
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.920]   so that I can do a good job presenting the truth.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.080]   He's a man just like us.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.480]   Philippians 1, 20, according to my earnest expectation
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.440]   and hope that I will not be put to shame in anything,
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.040]   but that with all boldness, Christ even now,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.480]   as always, be exalted in my body,
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.200]   whether by life or by death.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.760]   Paul's sitting in prison, possibly about to die,
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.480]   get martyred, and he's asking.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.120]   Pain's coming, struggle is coming, pray for me.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.960]   Probably has fear, concern for the pain,
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.520]   the people he is gonna leave behind,
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.440]   and the torture that he may experience
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.520]   to get him to deny Christ,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.800]   and just like any other human being,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.040]   he says pray for me so that I don't fail this,
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.240]   whether by life or death.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.760]   He was a man just like us,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.840]   and even Jesus, I mean, it was prophesied, prepared.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.960]   He deliberately came to die for us,
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.920]   and yet the night before he went to the cross,
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   he prayed to his father, Lord, is there any other way?
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.280]   And he agonized in his prayer, in his humanity.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.800]   This is beyond us.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.360]   If we do not pray,
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.320]   and God does not supernaturally support us
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.040]   through your prayers,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.680]   this is not something that man can do by being smart.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.640]   In fact, I would stay away from people
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.760]   who think they can do it,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.920]   'cause the next step is disaster.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.360]   God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble,
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.320]   so when you see a proud man in the front,
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.720]   get in another line, 'cause disaster's coming.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.120]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3, 5-6,
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.000]   not that we are adequate in ourselves
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.320]   to consider anything as coming from ourselves,
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.960]   but our adequacy is from God,
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.480]   who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.160]   Church is impossible.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.640]   I mean, think about how God put the church together.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   He didn't bring the smartest, right?
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.000]   Clearly, he didn't bring the smartest.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.600]   I mean, you read the New Testament, right?
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.440]   They're not the smartest.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.480]   In fact, Paul says, whenever they started getting proud
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   and competing with each other in 1 Corinthians,
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.920]   he's like, "Did you forget how dumb you were?
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.080]   "Why are you trying to be so smart?
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.200]   "Did you forget that God chose you
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.560]   "because you were of no repute?
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.280]   "Nobody knew who you were.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.040]   "In fact, God chose you because you were dumb.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.680]   "God chose you because you didn't have anything to offer."
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.440]   He said, "Why are you trying to up one another?
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.120]   "I'm gonna compete with righteousness,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.480]   "compete with knowledge."
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.680]   He said, "Humble yourself."
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.960]   He said, "The whole reason why the church is falling apart
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.600]   "is because somehow you see yourself
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.920]   "better than you really are.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.760]   "He chose you because you have nothing."
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.880]   If you look at the early church,
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.160]   he chose people who were gonna get out of the way.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.960]   He deliberately chose people who were gonna be humble.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.880]   He even allowed them to fail.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.920]   And whatever pride that they had,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.480]   whatever pride that Peter had,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.640]   he said, "Okay, they're all fair to you, but not me."
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.240]   And he just lets him fail, miserably.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.040]   In fact, he failed the most miserably
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.240]   than any other disciples 'cause he had the greatest pride.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.480]   He was trying to show them this is impossible,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.920]   and then the moment you think it's possible,
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.560]   that's when you are in the greatest danger.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.160]   That's when you are the weakest.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.720]   That's why Paul says, "When I am the weakest,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.040]   "he is the strongest."
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   Look at this church, the church that we run, right?
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.600]   You know why church is difficult?
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.320]   'Cause this room is filled with a bunch of weirdos.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:37.600]   Yeah, it's true, including myself.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.360]   You know, some of you guys may be thinking,
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.800]   "Mm, yeah, those people, yeah.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.280]   "I know some people."
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.080]   No, you, I'm talking about you, right?
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.120]   Talking about me.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.360]   And the reason why I say that is that
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.240]   no matter how socially well-adjusted you may be,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.600]   you're weird to somebody.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.400]   You're weird.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.360]   If you like Disneyland, you're weird.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.920]   You are weird.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.520]   I don't get it, right?
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.480]   So it doesn't matter how well-adjusted you are,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.280]   you're weird to somebody.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.960]   We come from all different backgrounds,
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.120]   different paradigms, and what we value,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.440]   what is right and wrong.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.480]   Outside of Christ, we all have different opinions.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.280]   Look at the way the pandemic is handled, right?
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.920]   Some of you are angry that we're not wearing masks.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.880]   (thudding)
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.960]   How dare you, right?
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.800]   And then some of you is like, "We're not communists."
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.200]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.040]   How dare you?
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.400]   And we're in the same room.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.800]   (laughing)
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.480]   We're serving the Lord together in the same room.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.640]   We're all weird in some way.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.080]   And I remember when we were doing the building,
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.320]   I realized how separate the world becomes easily.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.880]   'Cause we have a tendency, starting from,
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.080]   I think in junior high school,
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.280]   there's still some diversity.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.640]   You'll have friends all over the place,
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.880]   but as soon as you enter high school,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.800]   people start to kind of make clicks, right?
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.680]   So if you're athletes,
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.320]   you kind of hang out with the athletes.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.080]   If you're trying to get into Stanford,
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.200]   you have your group of friends.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.360]   There's a name for that,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.920]   but there's a group of people that go that direction, right?
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.440]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.960]   If you're good at tissue, or if you're into rap music,
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.880]   whatever it is,
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.120]   you slowly start to go your direction.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.680]   And then by the time you get into college,
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.120]   you're completely segregated.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.840]   Engineers are with engineers,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.320]   and then if you are blue collar,
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.000]   you end up going through with blue collar people.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.520]   And then when you graduate, you go to work,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.360]   you don't even see other people, right?
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.720]   So if you're a blue collar worker, and that's it,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.760]   those are the guys you relate to.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.920]   These are the guys, I hate these white collar guys.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.320]   If you're an accountant, that's the world you're in.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.000]   When we were building this building,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.320]   I realized how difficult this job is
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.080]   to be a general contractor, right?
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.440]   Because you have the engineers and the contractors
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.640]   who are trying to come to an agreement.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   And so what I noticed was the engineers are concerned
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.840]   about the integrity of the building.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.440]   They don't care how it looks.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.000]   Contractors are concerned about the functionality.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.680]   So I said the engineer built it
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.040]   so that the door is a certain size
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.760]   because you need these beams and this,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.480]   and in order for it to keep the building up.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.040]   But the contractors looked at the drawing
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.640]   and said, "Well, if you build it like that,
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   "it may be sturdy, but no one's gonna go through this door.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.320]   "It's not useful."
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.680]   So what's the point in having a strong structure
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.800]   when you can't use it?
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.600]   And the engineers, what's the use of having a door
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.280]   people use when you're gonna die?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.360]   There's a point that both of them have.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.760]   So you have engineers and you have contractors
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.400]   who have their view and they have truth,
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.720]   and both of them have realities that you need to abide by.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.360]   But when you try to bring these two people together,
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.640]   after experiencing this building and the other building,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.840]   I still wonder how they don't kill each other.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.880]   I mean, literally, I've seen fights break out
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.720]   in both this building and that building.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.520]   I'm in the middle of watching this
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.320]   and like, how do they ever come together?
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.280]   And this is the reason why these guys
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.320]   just hang out with their friends,
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.760]   and these guys hang out with their friends.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.040]   We have engineers in this building, right?
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.640]   Or sitting with contractors.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.520]   And the only time you will rub shoulders with them,
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.640]   'cause in any other context, you guys are just like,
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.560]   "Oh man, what are they doing?
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.680]   "They're so disorganized."
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.520]   You know what I mean?
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.760]   All they care about the functionality.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.160]   It's like, and then you have some of you guys
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.800]   just like live on spreadsheets.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.400]   Everything had to make sense tomorrow,
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.160]   8 a.m., 8.15, 8.17.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.200]   Every once in a while, we take a trip
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.880]   and I ask some of our engineer types like,
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   "Hey, can you give me some suggestions on where to go?"
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.320]   They give me 15 pages of their itinerary.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.520]   Oh, seriously, they wake up at six,
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.200]   at 6.05, wash your face, 6.07, you know what I mean,
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.320]   get the pot, 6.15, do this.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.120]   And it's like, "Oh my gosh, why would I even go on vacation?
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.160]   "I'm tired looking at this.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.960]   "I didn't wanna take a test."
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.280]   The church is filled with diverse people
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.200]   who have different perspective.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   And if they're not mature, they will not yield.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.800]   My perspective is right.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.520]   This building's gonna fall if we don't do this.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.560]   My perspective is right.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.520]   It's useless if we build it this way.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.160]   And they're unwilling to give in.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.060]   So, so much of what we do in the church
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:46.080]   is managing different personalities
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.480]   so that we can come together and love Christ.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.320]   But humanly speaking, you would never rub shoulders
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.360]   with a lot of people in the church.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.560]   Only reason why you're here
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.600]   is because we're attracted to Christ.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.240]   So, the moment that you lose that attraction to Christ,
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.000]   your personality is gonna come out.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.320]   Your selfishness is gonna come out.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.240]   It has to be done your way.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.200]   And you think everybody is stupid
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.000]   'cause they don't do it your way.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.560]   Imagine managing that.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.920]   I remember years ago, I gave a sermon
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.720]   and I got two phone calls that week.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:26.600]   One couple called me out.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.800]   Obviously, I can share this 'cause they're not here.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.280]   They called me out and they said it was urgent.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.400]   So, I came out, 10 o'clock, and they were lecturing me
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.760]   and saying, "Your sermons are too difficult.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.560]   "So, you need to give more illustrations
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.520]   "'cause I wanna invite my non-Christian friends
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.260]   "and when they come, it goes over their head.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.040]   "So, you need to change the way you preach."
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.720]   And I said, "Well, that's just the way I'm gonna preach."
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.000]   Sorry you don't like it.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.320]   I mean, 'cause it's your preference.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.520]   I'm not gonna say you're wrong,
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.280]   but that's just the way I believe.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.200]   That same week, I got called out by another guy
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.480]   saying, "Your sermons are too shallow."
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.560]   I mean, the text that you exposed,
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.800]   there's so much going on here and you only touched this
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.320]   and you need to do this and you need to get deeper.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:16.000]   Remember, as I was talking to this individual,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.800]   I was thinking, "I wanna introduce you to that couple
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:26.120]   "so that you can get into this room and see who wins."
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:32.720]   And then you come to an agreement where everybody's happy
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.040]   and then we'll have another conversation.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.980]   You'd be surprised how often that happens.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:44.360]   Let me tell you another funny story.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.820]   I have so many stories, I have to cut it off
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.880]   because we have communion today.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.600]   (congregation laughing)
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.240]   Years ago, it was November
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.680]   and it was Pastor Appreciation Month
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.480]   and our church was a lot smaller at that time
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.480]   and so people had an idea, let's encourage our pastors.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.080]   Some of you guys remember.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.040]   So without our knowledge, they started planning this thing
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.720]   and I just kind of hearing through the grapevine,
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.000]   something's gonna happen on this particular
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.480]   and they borrowed the space at Turtle Rock
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.840]   and they say, "Yeah, we're gonna try
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.400]   "to encourage our pastors."
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.200]   And then I started hearing, "There's trouble."
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.440]   I was like, "What's going on?"
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.120]   He's like, "Dude, it's a mess.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.800]   "There's a group that wants to encourage you guys this way
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.900]   "and then there's this group that wanted to encourage you
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.920]   "this way and they couldn't agree."
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.800]   And then as the week's going by, it's like,
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.740]   "Oh, they're fighting.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.700]   "They are heated."
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.520]   Yeah, and then one group is thinking,
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.460]   "I never wanna do anything with that group again.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.840]   "Don't put me in that guy's small group."
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.360]   And so by the time we got to the encouragement
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.400]   and we're sitting there and they made this video
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.040]   and the whole time I was sitting there thinking like,
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.500]   "Oh my gosh, don't ever do this again.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.340]   "This is the most burdensome, discouraging
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.840]   "Pastor's Appreciation Day I've ever experienced in my life."
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.100]   It almost like they came out of that thinking like,
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.280]   "Oh, we wanna appreciate it.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.800]   "Thank you so much and I hate you."
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.920]   I mean, that happens at the church sadly
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.520]   more than you would think.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:36.080]   It is humanly impossible
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.720]   to do what God calls us to do by our own strength.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:47.700]   On top of that, our church is run by volunteers.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.120]   This is not a corporation.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.500]   They can go, "Oh, if you get an MBA
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.120]   "and you organize this and do that and do that."
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.160]   Well, the difference between a corporation and this
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.800]   and a corporation, if you do a bad job, you're fired.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.000]   And you just get the money, hire another guy.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.400]   So we can make the quality go up and up and up,
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.360]   but the church, whether it's 30 or 3,000,
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.760]   the church is like a family.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.920]   So even if that person may not be doing the best job,
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.360]   it's like raising kids.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.960]   Even though they may not be,
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.840]   we can hire somebody to do the best job,
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.740]   but we don't do it that way
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.320]   because we're trying to raise up people.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.720]   And so the church with volunteers
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.520]   is not gonna run as well as a corporation
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.000]   because they get paid, and if they don't do that,
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:33.920]   there's immediate consequence.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.560]   You get fired, and somebody else who's skilled gets done.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.240]   People may be grumbling and hate being there,
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.600]   but the company's making a lot of money.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.840]   So as long as that's happening, then we're successful,
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.720]   but that's not how the church runs.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.120]   Church is filled with people
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.920]   who may not be the best at what they're doing,
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.160]   but because they volunteered,
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.360]   and we want to raise them up and make disciples,
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.560]   and we allow them to function.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.400]   So when the church is run with volunteers,
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.680]   when they're not focused, they drop the ball.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.360]   When they're busy, they drop the ball.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.680]   When they're discouraged, they drop the ball.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.640]   When they have relational problems, they drop the ball.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.280]   When they're tired, they drop the ball.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.880]   Or you juggled well in your 20s,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.680]   but you start dropping the ball in your 30s.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.920]   You did well when you're single,
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.000]   and then all of a sudden you're dating, you drop the ball.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.360]   You do well before you have kids,
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.480]   and then you have children, and you drop the ball.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.600]   You did well in your 30s,
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.600]   but then 40s come and you drop the ball.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.040]   So a lot of the work is picking up the balls, right?
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.800]   'Cause it's volunteers.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.040]   And on top of that, it keeps changing on us, right?
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.880]   I've never passed in a church that's almost 1,000 people.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.000]   I don't, I've never done this before.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:45.920]   For when you ask us, like,
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.400]   "What's your vision for the next stage?"
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.680]   I have no idea.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.880]   (congregation laughing)
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.560]   'Cause I've never done it before.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.600]   I've never passed a church this size before.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.960]   If we stayed 30 and I did it for 30 years,
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.800]   I could tell me, like, I'll write a book
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.840]   on how to pass a church of 30 people.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.960]   But it changes.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.520]   Like, oh, certain things were doing fine when it was 200,
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.840]   but it doesn't work at 500.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.280]   And then 700, it was fine, but it doesn't work at 1,000.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.440]   So I don't know what it's gonna be like
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.560]   when it gets beyond that.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.720]   We're just kind of making do.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.080]   On top of that, we don't get trained for any of this.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.560]   Yeah, we don't get trained for any of this.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.320]   Managing money, oh, I don't know.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.240]   We have to figure it out.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.080]   Pastors go get trained how to interpret the Bible.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.680]   So as long as I stay right here
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.000]   and I don't get off the pulpit, right,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.360]   'cause this is what the seminary prepared me to do, right,
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.120]   and even this gets difficult sometimes
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.880]   because I have to adjust to you, right?
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.080]   But it keeps changing.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.040]   Not only does it change because of the size,
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.400]   the culture keeps changing.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.120]   What was acceptable 30 years ago
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.560]   is no longer acceptable today.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.160]   What I could preach with confidence five years ago
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.660]   is no longer acceptable today.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.480]   I remember in the earlier part of the church
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.800]   when the Seeker Friendly Movement was blowing up,
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.640]   people were coming out,
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.480]   'cause our church is struggling.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.840]   They said, "Peter, you should be so stubborn.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.800]   "You need to follow what they're doing, what they're doing.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.680]   "You should be more cutting edge and doing this and that."
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.720]   And it's already hard enough to kind of manage,
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.400]   but I'm constantly, "You should do this, you should do that."
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.480]   It's like, "I'm not gonna do that."
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.860]   He's so stubborn.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.280]   It's like, I admit I'm stubborn, right?
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.880]   I am stubborn, I admit it.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.960]   At least I admit it.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.440]   You don't admit it.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.000]   But I remember how discouraging that was
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.420]   because we're struggling as it is,
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.400]   and it's like, oh, maybe it's because
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.720]   you're just being stubborn, right?
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.240]   But by that time, I was already burned out,
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.400]   and I'm not gonna play games anymore, right?
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.880]   I'd rather dig ditches, and I used to say that a lot.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.480]   I'd rather dig ditches because at least
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.960]   at the end of the day, you have a big hole,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.060]   and you did something.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.560]   But to have a church and fill it with people
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.780]   and all of that, for what purpose?
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.640]   Just to keep everybody who's nominal satisfied in the church
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.340]   so they can say, "Oh, this is a great church,
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.280]   "and places to raise children."
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.600]   But my conscience is not clear
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.200]   because the truth is not being told.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.440]   We're not practicing what he told us to practice.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.220]   Then at the end of the day, I committed to being fake.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:29.160]   So it's interesting 'cause people would come,
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.660]   and they would ask, "Oh, does your church practice,
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.400]   "does your church believe in predestination?"
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.240]   And I would say, "Yes."
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.160]   "I could never go to a church that practices
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.480]   "or teaches that."
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.320]   And they would walk away.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.480]   And then all of a sudden, the Young Resident Reform Movement
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.960]   come in, and then people younger would come into church.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.060]   It's like, "Do you guys practice church discipline?"
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.760]   Like, the younger people were asking me this,
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.720]   and say, "Yeah, we try to."
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.800]   "Are you guys Calvinists?"
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.140]   It's like, "Yes."
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:55.960]   "Okay, then we'll come to your church."
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.600]   That's interesting.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.140]   Five years ago, no one would come
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.320]   because we believe in predestination,
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.100]   and all of a sudden, it became the it thing.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.680]   And then as a result, the church started to grow.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.200]   There was nothing that we changed, right?
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.800]   So not only does the church change, the culture changes,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.460]   and you're constantly changing.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.600]   You're not faithful all the time.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.280]   You're not unfaithful all the time, right?
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.360]   This is impossible by our own strength.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.720]   The only way that the church can be the church
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.580]   is if God's doing something supernatural in us.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.080]   If all we're doing is gathering people
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.680]   and sing some songs to encourage you,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.180]   we don't need the Holy Spirit.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:41.800]   We don't need to be truthful, right?
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.920]   Why disturb people?
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.860]   If I take certain things out and say it in a certain way
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.900]   where more people will come,
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.140]   yeah, on the surface, we're successful.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.900]   If we're 2,000, we're more successful.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.180]   Where for 10,000, we're very successful.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.540]   But so what?
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.100]   If it's fake.
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:03.340]   If the truth is not being told.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.320]   If people are not being shaken out of their comfort zone
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.460]   so that they can meet the true resurrected Christ,
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.500]   it's all for nothing.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.280]   And this is not something that I can do because I'm bold.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.640]   It's not something that the leaders can do
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.960]   because they're more disciplined or knowledgeable
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.440]   or more courageous.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.560]   It's supernatural.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.200]   The only way that the church can be the church
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.280]   that he intended the church to be
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.520]   is if this is a gathering of regenerate people
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.760]   whose eyes have been opened to the gospel of Jesus Christ
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.600]   and despite our differences, despite our struggles,
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.300]   despite our temptations, despite our shortcomings,
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:46.260]   we become a community that worships God
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.820]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:50.100]   That's why we need to pray.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.160]   We have to pray.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.020]   We cannot build this church by our strength.
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:59.820]   So please pray for us.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.000]   Pray for the leadership.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.820]   Pray for times when we are discouraged.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:07.020]   And I know this is not unique to us.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.440]   I know there's times when you are discouraged
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.580]   and we pray for you.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:14.820]   And I know even now, we know many people in this room
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.020]   who are dealing with some heavy stuff in your life
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.280]   and we're praying for you.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.720]   And I pray for our younger pastors.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.300]   Discouragement comes and there's always this constant
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.480]   gnawing at everything that they're doing.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.680]   And discouragement, 'cause there are people
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.300]   like everybody else.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.380]   They have young children at home they're struggling with,
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.420]   trying to raise them.
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.300]   Pray for us so that we are not discouraged.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:41.260]   That our own sanctification, lift us up for us
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.520]   'cause we are men.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.220]   Weak men.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.340]   Pray for the ministry.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.980]   Pray for this church.
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:50.800]   You know, we live in a culture where everything
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.180]   that Christ teaches going against the principles
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.020]   of this world.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.680]   So do it for a short period of time, yes,
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.720]   but to do this year in and year out, we need your prayers.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:08.700]   So I'm gonna, again, before we open up the communion table,
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:13.900]   right, and I'm gonna read this really for myself, right?
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:23.780]   But I hope that as you remember this poem that I wrote,
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:26.180]   that these are the things that we struggle with
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.580]   that maybe it'll help you to pray for us more specifically.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:33.660]   I have come too far to retreat to remain in my defeat.
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.620]   I have no other path to take for there are too many things
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:37.660]   at stake.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:40.340]   My soul thirsts to see the only king to finally know
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:42.400]   the joy and peace he'll bring.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.360]   The light will fill the darkness everywhere,
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.540]   nothing that I know will compare.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.460]   Though I've fallen more than I can remember,
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.260]   my thoughts go back to that night in December
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:53.220]   when my soul was snatched from the fire
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.260]   and the only king filled all my desires.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.540]   Not by works, but by grace, I will meet.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.700]   I've come too far to retreat.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.600]   Would you take your communion cup now?
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.460]   And just have it ready.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:12.360]   If I can ask the praise team to come back up.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:18.920]   The reason why we have this communion,
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.280]   and we believe it's symbolic,
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.260]   but the reason why Christ inaugurated this
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:28.840]   is because he knows our tendency to drift.
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:31.980]   He knows our tendency to be discouraged,
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.360]   to question ourselves,
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.340]   to question what's going on around us.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.360]   And every time we participate in this communion
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.960]   is a reminder to us that it is not by your strength.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.300]   Christ upholds us.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.100]   We didn't earn this.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:53.180]   We didn't earn salvation.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.780]   We didn't earn his love.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:59.100]   And so this is a call to persevere.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.540]   We came to the throne of grace.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.140]   This represents the throne of grace.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.900]   He says every time you do this,
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.380]   he says do this in remembrance of me.
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:11.540]   And I know there's some of you in here
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.580]   so fatigued and tired,
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.260]   thinking I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.220]   to make it another month, another year.
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:22.580]   Be strengthened by this time.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.940]   Remember Christ who came for you.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.380]   That same Christ who loved you
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.900]   with all your baggage, all your sins,
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.300]   the very first day that you met him
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:36.100]   is the same Christ you will meet
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.000]   when we participate in this communion.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.940]   We didn't come here by our own strength.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.300]   Maybe some of you are discouraged by your own conscience,
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.920]   by your own behavior.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.820]   You're struggling over the same sins.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.280]   And the only way for us to be delivered by that
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.360]   is to come to Christ, receive his forgiveness,
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.220]   be washed in the blood of Christ.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.900]   Those of you who have hardship in your life
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.300]   and you're going through so much pain right now,
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:08.540]   come to the communion table and receive his love.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.660]   That God's presence in your life
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.440]   will become more real to you through your suffering
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.980]   than you would have ever known without it.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.740]   So he gives us this communion table
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.620]   because he knows our tendency to forget.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.020]   He knows our tendency to drift.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.140]   So as we participate in this communion,
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:32.060]   come to Christ, surrender to Christ,
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.800]   and then to cling to Christ,
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.500]   that we may be anchored to Christ.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.220]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 23, it says,
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:43.640]   "For I received from the Lord which I also delivered to you,
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.020]   "that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:46.960]   "in which he was betrayed took bread,
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.340]   "and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:50.720]   "This is my body which is for you.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.520]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.880]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.600]   saying, "This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.920]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.620]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.260]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.520]   And let me give you a few minutes
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.580]   to take some time to pray and prepare your heart.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:15.100]   And again, this is for those who have been baptized believers
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:18.580]   and so if you are here and you have not confessed Christ
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:19.700]   as your Lord and Savior,
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.140]   we ask that you do not participate in it.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.900]   There's no special power in this
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.340]   outside of participating in faith.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.260]   And so I wanna give you guys just some time to pray
[01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:29.520]   and then in a couple minutes,
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.900]   I'm gonna pray for us and wrap us up
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.820]   and then we'll rise for the closing service.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.420]   So let's take some time to pray before we participate.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:50.040]   (gentle music)
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.620]   (gentle music)
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.200]   (gentle music)
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.780]   (gentle music)
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:09.260]   (gentle music)
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:16.500]   (gentle music)
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:23.140]   (gentle music)
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.720]   (gentle music)
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:36.300]   (gentle music)
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:43.240]   (gentle music)
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:49.320]   (gentle music)
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.900]   (gentle music)
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:28:02.420]   (gentle music)
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:14.240]   Heavenly Father, we come before you
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.880]   as you started a good work in us.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.040]   I pray Lord God that your grace would be sufficient
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.680]   to carry it onto completion until the day of Christ.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   Lord, in our weakness, help us to find strength in Christ,
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.840]   that Jesus would truly be the head of this church.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.920]   And so we ask Lord God as we participate in this communion,
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.880]   remembering the blood of Christ shed for us,
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.940]   his body broken for our sins,
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:46.140]   that we may find renewal, strength, peace,
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:48.260]   and rest Lord God in this communion.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:53.100]   May Christ be exalted and your body strengthened
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:54.420]   as a result of this time.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.260]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:02.340]   Would you all take the wafer and if you would open it up
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.300]   and then when you're ready, we'll participate together.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.660]   Okay, let's do it together.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:11.580]   (wafers crunching)
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:25.040]   Would you all stand up with me for the closing praise?
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:34.720]   (gentle music)
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.300]   (gentle music)

[01:33:45.440 --> 01:34:01.620]   - Lord, we thank you for the grace that sustains us,
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.420]   which is more than enough, Lord God,
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:09.420]   to guide us, to build us, to give us hope, peace, and rest.
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:13.380]   Lord, I wanna especially lift up our brothers and sisters
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.860]   who are wrestling, struggling with various trials
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:16.780]   in their lives.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:19.980]   Lord, we pray that your comforting hands
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.020]   would be around them.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:24.820]   Give them the grace and the tangible love
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.140]   that they need to know, Father God,
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.540]   that you are there for them.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:32.620]   We pray, Father God, for those who have been discouraged,
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.900]   maybe by their own sins and distractions,
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.660]   maybe because of relational issues
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.540]   or just times are difficult for them.
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:43.400]   I pray you would strengthen them, encourage them,
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.820]   give them the power that they need, Lord God,
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.720]   to continue and to strive.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:50.820]   We pray, Father God, that you would open our eyes
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:54.360]   to see the hope that we have in him,
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.580]   that we would not put any confidence in our flesh
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:01.700]   or any promises of man, our bank account,
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.940]   our government, our culture, whatever it may be,
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:09.620]   help us, Lord God, to be firmly rooted in Christ.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.020]   So wherever it is that you send us this week,
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.620]   help us, Lord God, to be the aroma of Christ,
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.460]   that Christ and Christ alone may be magnified.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
