[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   So as you guys know, we've been in chapter 4 for maybe about a month or so, and chapter
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.040]   4 basically is leading us in conclusion to the previous chapters of Hebrews where he
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040]   was warning about not drifting.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.720]   We spent a good time in our retreat talking about drifting and how we ought to be anchored
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.960]   in Christ, and so the warning for that has led to chapter 4 where we have the 4 let us
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   statements to move.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.600]   That if we have been drifting in any way, he says first of all, he says in verse 1,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.240]   let us fear while a promise remains of entering his rest and any one of you may seem to have
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.440]   come short of it.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.240]   So first call is if you have caught yourself, if you find yourself beginning to drift internally,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.760]   possibly externally, and you hear the word of God, he says today if you hear a voice
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.800]   do not harden your heart, he says first and foremost to fear.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.120]   Because he who fears God really in the end will have nothing else to fear.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.680]   In other words, when he's calling to fear, if you see yourself drifting, he says to take
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.540]   reverence, take seriously that this is not just something frivolous, that the consequence
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.400]   of continuing to drift, that if your heart has become hardened and it's been months and
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.360]   years and maybe even longer than that, that if you catch yourself having to have drifted
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.560]   or drifted so far away that when you close your eyes you have no presence of God in your
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.760]   life, that you don't know what it's like to be in his presence because it's been so long.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.160]   You don't know what it's like to worship God because it's been so long.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   You've been just singing and mouthing words but you haven't worshipped God in a long time.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.160]   If that is the case, he says fear.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.440]   There should be fear.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.040]   If we genuinely believe that Christ is our salvation and we have drifted away from him,
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040]   there ought to be fear.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100]   There ought to be reverence.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.380]   Let us fear.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.300]   And then he says if you have found yourself to have drifted and there is a sense of seriousness
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.520]   that this needs to be corrected, he says in verse 11, let us be diligent.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.080]   It is not enough just to have conviction.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.120]   You know what, those messages of yours are true and I feel bad.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.760]   Repentance isn't simply feeling bad about something.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.000]   Repentance isn't just learning things and say, "Well, I ought to be here but I'm here
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.680]   but thank God for God's grace."
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.960]   He says, "No, if you have found yourself drifting from God," he says, "let us fear and if you
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.640]   fear let us be diligent to enter this rest."
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.040]   What applications are we making?
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.120]   What changes are taking place that we are actively, diligently seeking to get back on
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.520]   track?
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.080]   Let us be diligent to enter that rest.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.020]   And then verse 14, if that is the case and if you, maybe some of you have not drifted,
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.160]   maybe you've been walking right for a while or maybe some of you guys are getting back
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.040]   on track and if that's the case, he says, "Let us hold fast since our great high priest
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.480]   has passed through the heavens."
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   Let us hold fast.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.840]   Let us hold on to this tightly so that this does not happen again.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.160]   Because our natural tendency to neglect our faith, once our bills are paid, once the emergency
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   is taken care of, once our family is okay and we have a paycheck coming in and we're
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.280]   healthy, once everything is back to safety, we have a tendency to just drift.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.040]   Because all you have to do to drift is to do nothing.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.240]   All you have to do to drift is not actively seek what's wrong.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.480]   Just passively to do nothing and you will just drift because this is where we live.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.920]   And so therefore, he says, if you recognize that and you fear and you are committed to
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.880]   be diligent in seeking this rest, he says to hold fast so that you do not drift.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.920]   The fourth and final "let us" statement is really where all of this is leading us to.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.840]   The whole purpose of our salvation is really summarized in what he says in the fourth statement
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840]   in verse 16.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.000]   "Let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy and
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.640]   find grace to help in time of need."
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.560]   Our whole point of our salvation is so that we can be reconciled to this holy God.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.600]   And so an individual who says that he has a relationship with God but never draws near
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.920]   to God is missing the whole point of salvation.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.400]   Because the whole point of salvation is to break down the barrier between us and this
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.000]   holy God.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.160]   And that's what the cross was for.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.440]   So an individual who talks about God's love, who talks about church and talks about his
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:52.960]   faith and yet never draws near to God is like buying a nice car and never driving it.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.720]   Purchasing a nice comfortable home up in the hills and never living in it.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.400]   It contradicts the very purpose of our salvation.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.600]   And so verse 16 is the summary not only of what he is saying in chapter 1, 2, 3, and
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.720]   4, it's really a summary of Christian living period.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.560]   The whole point of our salvation is to get us back into union with this God.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   Because it is in this union we find life.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.960]   It is in this union that we find rest.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.840]   But you have to understand that this command to draw near, how that would have sounded
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.960]   to a first century Jew.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.280]   Because to us, when you say draw near, it's like yes, we need to draw near.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.600]   I feel bad that we don't do that, but I need to draw near to God because the gates have
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   been opened.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.360]   But you have to understand a first century Jew, to draw near to God, what that would
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.560]   have sounded like to a first century Jew.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:57.200]   Because in every instance where a Jew in his natural state met God, it meant death.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.760]   Everything about the Old Testament law told people to stay away.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.680]   They didn't tell them to come.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.360]   In Exodus 19, 20-24, Moses said to the Lord, "The people cannot come to the Mount of Sinai,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.520]   for you warned us, saying, 'Set bounds about the mountains and consecrate it.'
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.680]   Then the Lord said to him, 'Go down and come up again, and you and Aaron with you.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.080]   But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, or he
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.640]   will break forth upon them.'"
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.040]   When he says he will break forth upon them, that's another way of saying that God's going
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.840]   to bring judgment and they're going to die.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.360]   He says, "You come, because I have some things I need to share with you, but the priests
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.800]   and everybody else, if they break through and come up this mountain, they're going to
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   die."
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.760]   So imagine that.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   God didn't say, "Come up to them.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   I am here.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   Come up."
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.960]   He actually says, "I am here, so stay away."
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.280]   Exodus 20, verse 19, "Then they said to Moses, 'Speak to us yourself, and we will listen.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.920]   But let not God speak to us, or we will die.'"
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.800]   The Israelites got their message.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.320]   And so not only would they not go up to the mountain, even hearing the voice of God, they
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   were scared.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.200]   Think about today, how we want to hear God, where is God, how come God's not speaking
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   to us?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.520]   To a Jew, he says, "Don't let him speak to us, because if that God, that holy God speaks
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.880]   to us, we will die.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.120]   So we need a mediator.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.040]   Moses, you go speak to him, and you tell us what he is saying, but we cannot.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.800]   I can't even listen to him.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   I'm afraid."
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.920]   Numbers chapter 17, 12 through 13, after setting up the tabernacle, and the whole purpose of
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.360]   the tabernacle is designed so that the sacrificial systems can be made, and then they would come
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.960]   and draw near to God.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   But the Israelites knew who God was and is.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.640]   This is what they say.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.560]   Numbers 17, 12 to 13, "Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, 'Behold, we perish.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   We are dying, and we are all dying.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.400]   Everyone who comes near to the tabernacle of the Lord must die.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.520]   Are we to perish completely?'"
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.880]   They were deathly afraid of the tabernacle, because they knew that that's where the presence
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.840]   of God was going to dwell.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.120]   And he was right in the middle of the camp, and even though the whole purpose of the tabernacle
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.300]   was to teach them that the sacrifice is going to wash them of their blood, so that they
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.480]   may have fellowship with God, the presence of God scared them.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.440]   If we come to the tabernacle, we will die.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   And again, in Leviticus 16, verse 2, this instruction was given to Aaron, the high priest,
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.360]   representative of all the priests.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.560]   He says, "And the Lord said to Moses, 'Tell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.440]   at any time into the holy place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.720]   ark, or he will die, for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.'"
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.480]   The high priest was given very specific instruction that when he comes to the Holy of Holies once
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:08.680]   a year, that if he doesn't come when I prescribe him to come, if he doesn't come and cleanse
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.060]   himself before he comes, and then even if he does come, that if he doesn't do his duty
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.680]   and then hurry up and leave, he says he will die.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.400]   Over and over again, they are warned not to come.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.800]   So imagine that to a first century Jew, to hear, "Draw near to God with confidence."
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.440]   It won't sound the same the way we would hear it today.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.440]   Of course, I feel guilty.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.800]   We should be going to him.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   Where is God?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.160]   How come he's not speaking to us?
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:46.000]   There's a reason why in Jewish tradition, why they asked the high priest to wear a bell.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.440]   Because they wanted to check if he went in there, if he's going to come out safe.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.400]   So if he went in there and he didn't come out in time, they were afraid he died.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.000]   So they were hearing for his bell, or he's still alive.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.560]   The reason why they started doing that is because other priests prior to him probably
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.000]   died.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.280]   They didn't just start that practice out of nowhere.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.120]   They probably started that practice because they came in just like Aaron's two sons,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.520]   Nadab and Abihu.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.280]   The first sacrifice that was made by the two first priests, they died because they didn't
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.880]   follow God's direction.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.120]   They offered up strange fire and the punishment was capital punishment.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   They died.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.560]   So this history of Israel's history about God's presence in the midst of Israel scared
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.240]   them.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.760]   We can't draw near to God.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.480]   Moses, you speak to him and you talk to us.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.400]   You call us to come to the tabernacle, but when we come to the tabernacle, we die.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.240]   The high priest, you call him to come in and make sacrifice.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.760]   When he comes, he dies.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:00.120]   So for a first entry to here, therefore draw near to God.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   I guarantee you it wasn't flippant.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.440]   It was not a flippant response.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.800]   It's a yes, we go in.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.120]   My guess is they probably were asking, how?
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.920]   How can we just go in like that?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.200]   What if we die?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.400]   My guess is that's probably what they were asking.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.240]   Part of the reason why there's this elaborate explanation about the atonement of Christ
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.640]   is to give them security.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.580]   Is to let them know you're covered.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.240]   You can draw near now because of what Christ has done.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.320]   I want to look at four things that it says about drawing near in this text.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.200]   One, it says we can draw near to God because the throne is the throne of grace.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.080]   That's why it says come near to the throne of grace.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.000]   Now we already talked about how the throne that he's talking about, he's talking about
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   the mercy seat.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.680]   That in the Holy of Holies, you have the Ark of the Covenant, and you had the wings of
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.600]   the cherubim, and the high priest would go in on the day of atonement.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.960]   After he's cleansed himself and purified himself, he would go there and sprinkle the blood on
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.120]   the curtains and all the articles, representing that the sins of the nation is covered.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.360]   His own sin is covered, and God would speak to him at that mercy seat.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.640]   The scripture says that when Christ came and he made his sacrifice and was resurrected,
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.840]   he sat on that throne.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.200]   That was Christ's throne all this time.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.720]   Where God was going to come and meet the nation of Israel, meet God's people, it was at that
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.200]   throne, his mercy seat.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.480]   So all this time, everything that Israelites did was to prepare for Christ to come and
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.240]   sit on his throne.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.640]   And that's the throne he's referring to when he says to come to the throne of grace.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:52.720]   But the first thing to recognize about this is first and foremost, it is a throne.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.600]   It is a throne.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.760]   When we think about a throne, we typically think about the king who rules.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.860]   He is sovereign.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:08.000]   If you are at a monarchy, none of us lived under a monarchy, or I'm just assuming, so
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.280]   we don't know what it's like to live in a monarchy.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.360]   But we've studied history.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.040]   A monarch basically means that he is completely sovereign.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.680]   He makes the law.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   There is no check and balance.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.080]   So if the monarch says, if the king says, "I don't like the way you're dressed," put
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   him in jail.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.280]   That's it.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.080]   There is no judicial system.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.640]   There is no Congress to check him.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.520]   If the king says it, it's law.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:38.880]   So if the king says, "I need to talk to you," your immediate response isn't, "Yes!"
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.000]   If I go, king must have something to give me.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.720]   The first thing that we probably would think is, "Oh my gosh, if I go in there, and what
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.440]   if he's ticked off?
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.120]   What did I do?
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.880]   Did I say something?
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   Did I do something?
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   Did I not obey the law?
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   Like, what happened?
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   Why is the king calling me?"
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:02.240]   We don't automatically think a gift is waiting when the king calls you.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:11.040]   Our generation has learned about the cross on this side of the covenant almost exclusively
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.840]   to the point that we don't understand the God of the Old Testament, the God of righteousness
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840]   and God of holiness.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.680]   And so when we think about coming to Christ, we automatically think of coming to this great
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.360]   grandfather or grandfather who just has candy in his pocket all the time.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.440]   We just automatically assume this grace.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.120]   Even Christ, when we think about Christ, we always talk about him as the humble servant
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.200]   who's on his knees and washing the disciples' feet, and that's the Christ that we see, which
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.520]   is all true because that's the image that he left us.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.480]   But in Philippians chapter 2, 9 through 11, it says, "For this reason," because he did
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.800]   that, "God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name,
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   so that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow of those who are in heaven and on earth
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.440]   and under the earth, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.880]   of God the Father."
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.620]   He says because he humbled himself, what happened?
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.120]   He was exalted.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   He is exalted.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.880]   He is sitting on his throne.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.960]   And every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.240]   In fact, in Romans chapter 10, 9, it says that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:29.160]   is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:36.120]   If you know Jesus as a Savior but not as your Lord, it is not the Lord of the Bible.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.040]   It is not the God of the Bible that you have met.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.380]   You met the version of him that is preached in our generation, but that is not the God
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.800]   of the Bible.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.200]   When he says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord," he's not just talking about
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.020]   a title.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.480]   He's not talking about the Beatles who became lords.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.960]   They got the title Lord in England because their songs were so great and that they brought
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.480]   some honor to England, and as a result of that, they were crowned as lords.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   It's just a title of honor.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.920]   This is identity here.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.720]   It's not talking about a title.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.920]   We just call him Lord out of respect.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.080]   It's who he is.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.480]   So when he says that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you're confessing
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.720]   his Lordship in your life, that he is my sovereign, he is my king, he is the one I submit to,
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.580]   he's the one I honor, he's the one I follow, he's the one I obey.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:40.300]   So first and foremost, we need to understand, he says, to draw near to the throne, to the
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.620]   throne of grace.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.800]   We don't automatically assume.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.440]   If we understood all that the first century Jew understood about who God was, the natural
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.180]   question that we wouldn't have been asking is, "Why is God so severe?"
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:00.220]   He would have been asking, "Why is God so gracious?"
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:05.460]   He who does not know Christ as Lord does not know Christ at all.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.980]   But that's the mystery.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.860]   Why would that God be gracious?
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:17.380]   Why would the throne of God, a holy, righteous God, the same God who in his anger destroyed
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.820]   nations, the flood...
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:29.240]   You know, in our day and story, the flood has become a nice Sunday school VBS story.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.380]   Flood is the killing of the world.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.260]   Flood gave us a glimpse of what may come at the end.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.860]   Not may come, what is going to come at the end.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.500]   It's just a glimpse of God's wrath.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.080]   That's what it looks like when God is angered and he carries out his anger.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.500]   That's the same God that is calling us to come to him.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.320]   The same God who wiped out Jericho completely.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.540]   The same God who opened up the ground and swallowed up the grumblers.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:04.580]   It's that same God who brought plague upon nations because they angered him.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:10.700]   It's the same God that brought upon judgment upon nation upon nation because they would
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.420]   not listen to him.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:19.660]   It is that same God that the nation of Israel was terrified just looking at the tabernacle.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.980]   It didn't cause warm feelings in their heart.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.380]   "Oh, God is among us."
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.260]   It caused terror.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.860]   That God that we couldn't go up to the mountain is here.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   It is that God.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:40.180]   He says, "Come, draw near to that throne of grace."
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:46.260]   It is that throne that became grace in Christ.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.460]   All the time.
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.700]   That mercy seat was preparing for Christ's rule.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.980]   That was his seat all the time.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   That's where God was going to come and meet the nation of Israel.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.220]   And that's where we come to meet God.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.020]   It is at his throne of grace.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.300]   He says, number two, we can draw near to God because Jesus sympathizes with our weakness.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.940]   The word sympathy basically means to come alongside.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.340]   To have same passion.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.260]   He sympathizes because he stepped in our shoes.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.060]   He became one of us.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.380]   You ever have a situation where you have a hard time understanding somebody but once
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:31.220]   you step in their shoes, you say, "Oh, I get it."
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:39.780]   I've done probably every poor paying minimum wage job that you can possibly think of.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.380]   Just to pay bills.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:49.920]   And so I have compassion for every time I drive through McDonald's and I see the workers.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.060]   When it's young kids, I still respect them.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.060]   That's a lot of work.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:58.420]   But when I see adults in there, simply because they were born in a different country and
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.220]   they're working their tail off for minimum wage.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.140]   How many of you work that hard?
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.980]   Like Monday through Friday?
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.260]   My guess is nobody here.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.700]   God blessed us.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.980]   These guys are working their 40 hours a week, working their tail off.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.020]   Their legs are tired at the end of the day and they do all of this for minimum wage for
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.300]   most of them.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:29.020]   Every time I drive through there, I respect this person.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.820]   I respect him.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.220]   Because I know how tiring this is.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.620]   Years ago, and I think I shared with some of you or I think I've shared in the past
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.820]   years that in the beginning of my relationship with Esther, that we really thought that we
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.700]   were going to be going into homeless ministry.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.660]   And so the more I got into it, the more it started to dawn on me that if I'm going to
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.140]   really do homeless ministry and our goal was to set up a shelter and disciple them and
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.220]   help them off the street, I need to really know what it's like being homeless.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.840]   So I had this crazy idea, I'm going to go out on the street.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.780]   And so I spent three days and two nights.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.700]   And it may sound crazy, but I already had made some friends, a couple of friends that
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.740]   we would come out every Tuesday and then I would meet them sometimes on Saturday and
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.420]   I was meeting up with them, trying to share the gospel and discipling this one particular
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   guy.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.140]   And so I felt comfortable enough that if I hung out with him, that I would be okay.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.140]   So I asked him, "Hey, I'm planning to come out here."
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.780]   I'm trying to say, obviously he thought I was crazy.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.580]   I said, "It's only for a few days."
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:38.020]   So I went out and again, I journaled during that period.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.420]   And so I went back and as I was thinking about this, I went back to try to read the journal
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.620]   that I wrote of my experience of being out there.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.260]   And it brought back a lot of memories.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:55.340]   I just wanted to read you a small clip or a blip of what I wrote in my journal.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.260]   The life of homeless is monotonous.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.780]   The biggest problem is not food or shelter, but it's the feeling of hopelessness and emptiness.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:09.700]   The Santa Ana Civic Center would not open up for homeless until 6 p.m. each day so that
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.140]   we just spent the day walking around just killing time.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.160]   I felt like a little kid again.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.580]   I had no worries or problems to deal with, at least for the moment.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.700]   These two guys were no longer just homeless people to me that I hung around with.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.300]   They began to become true friends.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.540]   This made me happy and sad at the same time.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.180]   I knew I would go back to my comfortable home in a day while these guys would stay out here
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.060]   permanently.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.420]   When I asked, "What's the hardest thing about being homeless?"
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.980]   They said that they just didn't matter in this world.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.980]   If they died, no one would miss them.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.620]   That short period, even though it was just a couple of days, completely transformed my
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.020]   paradigm because they weren't just homeless people.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.980]   They were just people that just didn't have shelter.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.940]   As I was going back and reading this, there are some names that I put there that I completely
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.300]   forgot because it's been a couple of decades since I thought about them.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.020]   This one particular guy, I remember his name was Angel.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   We became good friends.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.900]   We spent so much time together.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.180]   He was the guy who protected me while I was out there for a few days.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.220]   To be honest, I completely forgot until I was reading that.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.380]   It brought back so many memories.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.140]   Angel was a guy who was a drug addict.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.980]   He went to jail.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.580]   While he was in jail, he met Christ.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.700]   By the time he came out, his family basically disowned him.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.700]   He had nowhere to go.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.700]   That's why he was out in the street.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.700]   He was a perfectly sane guy.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.700]   He was able to work.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.020]   He was a healthy young guy.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.340]   It's just him going to jail and coming back just ruined his life.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.180]   He was out in the street.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.900]   He met the Lord, but the temptation came in.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.180]   He was really struggling.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.380]   He wanted to get right with God, but then the temptation of crack at that time was so
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.620]   strong that he was going back and forth, back and forth.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.900]   I remember we tried so hard to get him off the street and get him into a shelter.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.260]   I remember spending about a year and a half with this guy.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:17.260]   All these memories started coming back, just wondering where he is, what's going on.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:23.060]   What really stuck with me during that period was we naturally think when we think of homeless
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.380]   people that we need to give them shelter.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.880]   They don't have food, so we need to give them food.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.460]   They don't have a job, so let's help them get a job.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:39.020]   But I realized that being out there, I realized that that wasn't their problem because each
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.900]   of the day I was there, they knew exactly where to go to get food.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.220]   Tuesday you come here, Wednesday morning you go there, so if you need a shower, you go
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.820]   down the street and this Catholic church has this door open.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.620]   If on Thursday you need to go get some clothes, you can go down to this street and they have
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.620]   clothes.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.700]   There's food that they can eat, at least one meal.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.540]   Some days there's like three or four of them, like churches come and compete with each other
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.420]   to do homeless ministry.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.660]   So it wasn't food.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.780]   My natural thought is, okay, let's get them off the street and get them into a hotel or
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.780]   motel.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.460]   So we tried doing that and I realized that that wasn't a big deal to them.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.300]   In my mind, why wouldn't you want that?
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   It's free.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.860]   We're going to take care of all your bills and then get you back on the street.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:28.540]   But I realized something happened in their life that got them there to begin with.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.620]   And in California, it's not that hard because the weather is pretty nice.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.100]   We deliberately go camping anyway.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.100]   We sleep outside.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.140]   So it's not uncomfortable.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.120]   There's maybe about a month out of the year that it's maybe too cold and then a few times
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   out of the year it rains.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.540]   So whenever it rains, it gets too cold and the church down the street opens up their
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.940]   gym and we get to sleep there.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.020]   And so I got to sleep there one day because it happened to be cold and rainy.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.000]   And so outside of those few times, it's actually comfortable sleeping outside, at least the
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.120]   weather-wise.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.460]   Think about how hard we work to put away money to retire so you don't have to work.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.740]   The homeless people found a quick way to get there.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.300]   And I'm not talking about people who have mental issues.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.160]   I'm talking about people who just kind of learn to be out there.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:23.020]   And I realized what I thought they needed wasn't what they needed.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:29.380]   The primary problem with homelessness is not homelessness.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.420]   It's hopelessness.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.900]   And that problem isn't any different with people who have homes.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.220]   It's the same.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.020]   I would have never understood that until I stepped into their shoes, even if it was just
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.180]   for a couple days.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.140]   God stepped into our shoes.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.780]   He became an infant and lived his whole life simply so that he could sympathize with our
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.780]   weakness.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.940]   The word "weakness" just literally means "sickness."
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.280]   That he understands our sickness.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.740]   He wasn't a woman.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.020]   He wasn't a grandpa.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.020]   He wasn't married.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.900]   But when he says he sympathized, he has compassion, he knows what it's like to live and to be
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.980]   raised in a sinful world with all the temptations.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:25.180]   So he knows and recognizes our weakness, and that's why he's able to come to rescue us.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.560]   Because he knows exactly what our struggle is.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.740]   He knows exactly what our weaknesses are.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.900]   You know, to me, the strangest scene in the gospel is when Jesus is crying out to the
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.940]   Father before he goes to the cross.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.540]   And he's anxious.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:49.580]   God, the Son of God, he's anxious and he's crying out to God.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.300]   Is there another way?
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.620]   He's the one who told his disciples this is why he came.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.980]   It was prophesied from the beginning, all the way from Genesis, that this is what he
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.540]   was going to do.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.300]   He deliberately stirred up the leaders so that he would get caught.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.980]   And even when Peter was going to fight him, he told him to put his sword away because
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.660]   he volunteered to go to the cross.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:16.500]   Yet at the Garden of Gethsemane, he cried out, "God, is there another way?"
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:24.420]   Just like any other human being about to face the biggest torture the next day, biggest
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:30.100]   humiliation, the greatest pain that he's ever experienced, physically and spiritually, to
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.620]   be separated from Father.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:37.600]   Just like any other human being, he cried out, "Is there another way?"
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.580]   He was tempted, yet did not sin.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.940]   Not my will, but your will be done.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.940]   That's what he did.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:56.600]   And as a result of that, he says, he can sympathize with our weaknesses.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.820]   He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.940]   of God.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.460]   That's the mystery.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.940]   That's the mystery that causes worship.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.340]   See, somebody who kind of hears that and is like, "Oh, he did that for me.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.620]   Let's just go in."
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:21.180]   That person is not worshiping because the difference between a man and woman who worships
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:30.780]   is a person who comes to the cross and recognizes that this mystery is beyond my comprehension,
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.780]   is beyond me.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.300]   And so for the rest of his life, he is seeking to understand, "Why would you do this for
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.340]   me?
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.120]   Why would you do this for me?"
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.060]   And it is that mystery, it is that pursuit that causes you to worship in spirit and in
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.220]   truth.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.500]   But an individual who says, "Oh, yeah, he's gracious.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.000]   Let's just go."
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.580]   You're coming physically.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.300]   You're doing the right things, but you know you're not worshiping because there is no
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.740]   awe in your heart.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.380]   It is this mystery, it is this cross that he tells us to come that creates awe.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.140]   Why would he do this?
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.740]   It's the foundation of our worship.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.980]   It is the foundation of our fellowship.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.140]   It is the foundation of our pursuit.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.580]   It is the foundation of our worship.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.180]   Draw near to God to the throne of confidence.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.860]   Number three, draw near to God, he says, with confidence.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.620]   I mean, think about that.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.620]   To tell a first-century Jew to draw near.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.700]   In and of itself, are you trying to kill me?
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.340]   Do you remember what happened to Aaron's children?
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.980]   Do you remember what happened to Israel?
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:42.900]   Remember what happened to all these people who entered the tabernacle without proper
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.940]   cleansing to draw near to God?
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.820]   Are you crazy?
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.580]   The first-century Jew, just that alone, draw near to God.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.100]   But then he says, "Draw near to God with confidence."
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.540]   Are you kidding?
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:03.980]   I mean, like I said, in our generation, we've been presented this God like a grandfather
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:10.300]   who always has candy, is never angry, and he just kind of just lets you go.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.660]   And so when we say, "Draw near to God," yes, and we have this image of just jumping into
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.020]   grandpa's lap, telling his story.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.140]   Now, we're not saying that God is not merciful.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.880]   We're not saying that God is not gracious.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.340]   But if we don't understand his holiness and his righteousness, then even grace you don't
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.060]   fully understand.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.380]   Draw near with confidence.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.900]   Hebrews 10, 19-22, "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:42.300]   place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:47.980]   the veil that is his flesh, and since we have great priests over the house of God, let us
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:53.540]   draw near with sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.580]   from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:04.940]   To be able to enter the throne of grace with confidence, you have to believe.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.540]   Because only those who genuinely believe, who have been covered by the blood of Christ,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:16.660]   can even enter, can even imagine that we can somehow have access to this God.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:22.460]   Sin, unconfessed sin is what causes timidness to come to Christ.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.740]   Unconfessed sins is what causes timidness to speak of Christ.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.580]   Unconfessed sin causes us to be timid in our fellowship with others, and unconfessed sin
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.560]   is the cause of our weakness.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:42.460]   But those who have been covered by the blood of Christ, we have confidence.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.820]   We have confidence.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.820]   We have confidence because the only person that ultimately matters, the one who created
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.260]   the universe, he's on my side.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.300]   So automatically you have confidence.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.860]   But sin causes timidness.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   Compromise causes timidness.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.580]   Part of the reason why so few people go out and evangelize and share their faith is because
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.580]   of their sin.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.900]   It's not because they don't know how to say something.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.980]   It's not because they don't have the words, that they're not smart.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.580]   It's because of sin.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.980]   Sin makes us timid.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.500]   Sin makes us timid in our worship.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.480]   Sin makes us timid in our fellowship because we're afraid to be open and honest.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:26.020]   But those who draw near to the throne of God, through the grace of God, who have been covered
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:31.100]   by the blood of Christ, automatically there's boldness.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.100]   There's boldness.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.540]   Because it doesn't matter if the whole world is against me because God said it's okay.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:42.280]   It doesn't matter what the rest of the world thinks because God said it's okay.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.540]   Then all of a sudden our confidence comes.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.660]   Not because of people, not because of adoration, not because of our accomplishments, because
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.740]   of God.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.860]   Draw near with confidence.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:59.300]   Fourth and finally, we need to draw near because that's where we will find help in time of
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.620]   need.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.300]   Where do you run to when you need help?
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.700]   You know what I see the difference between a nominal Christian and a Christian?
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.980]   And let me distinguish, okay?
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.900]   Nominal Christian is not a Christian.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.480]   So some of you might be bothered by that.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.800]   And if you are bothered by it, challenge me.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.660]   And when I say challenge me, I'm not saying let's go wrestle, right?
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.660]   When I say challenge me, it's like read the scripture yourself.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.520]   Open up the Bible.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.800]   See if nominal Christians are Christians.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.600]   So challenge me.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.800]   I use the term nominal Christian because we've created this term for people who are in the
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.200]   church who are not following Christ.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.440]   We've created this term for people who are in the church and not worshiping God.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   We've created this term to describe people who've been raised in the church, who are
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.240]   at the church, who attend the church, but clearly Christ is not their Lord.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   So what do we call them?
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.000]   Well, they're not non-Christians because they're in the church.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.280]   Well we can't call them Christian because this is what Christian looks like.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.000]   So we've created this nominal Christian as nominal Christian.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.300]   There's like a third category.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.160]   There is no third category.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.600]   Nominal Christians are not Christians.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.840]   Again, if that bothers you, challenge me.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.720]   Read the scripture for yourself.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.600]   Don't quote me some pastor.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   Don't refer me to a book.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.840]   Go to the Bible yourself.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.700]   Now having said that, the difference between a nominal Christian and a Christian is the
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.080]   access that we have to this God.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:37.320]   See a nominal Christian is always looking for help from other people with God.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   I need people.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.800]   Their first instinct is to go to people.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   I need counseling.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   I need small group.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   I need church.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   I need this.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   I need leaders.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   I need older brother.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   I need older sister.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   So you're always looking for people to help you with God.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:59.040]   But if you know God and you have access to God, and God says, "Come to me."
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.520]   He is our source, not the people.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.020]   God helps us with people.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.560]   People don't help us with God.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.240]   He's our ultimate source.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.000]   He's the one who helps us.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   That's the difference.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.720]   If you know Christ, for Isaiah 55, 6-7, "Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.400]   Call upon him while he is near.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.760]   Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.720]   And let him return to the Lord and he will have compassion on him and to our God for
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.160]   he will abundantly pardon."
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.240]   Do you seek God?
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.800]   Do you seek people?
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   Do you know God?
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.760]   Do you know people?
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.020]   Which is it?
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:47.400]   If you have access to the God of the universe, why would he not be your first that you go
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.760]   to?
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.560]   Before you cry out for people's love, before you cry out for community, cry out to God
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.480]   first.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   He's the one who created all things.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.920]   He's the one who knows all things.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.480]   He's the only one who can actually do anything about anything.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.240]   Other human beings can make promises with the best of attentions, but eventually, if
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:18.160]   your faith is founded upon the kindness and grace and love of other people, it will eventually
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:24.040]   crumble because there are people just like you, just like me.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.480]   They are weak just like me, just like you.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.640]   That's why he says, "Draw near to him because that's where we will find help in time of
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   need."
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.000]   Matthew 7 and 8, "Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Seek and you will find.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.200]   Knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.520]   For everyone who asks, receive.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.680]   And he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened."
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.000]   You do not have because you did not ask.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.440]   And you do not ask, right?
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:57.200]   You ask but you do not get because what you're asking for has nothing to do with him.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.000]   Come, seek him first.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.240]   And let me conclude with this.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.480]   First Peter 5, 6 through 7, "Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God and
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.880]   he may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on him because he cares for
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880]   you."
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:23.760]   Let me ask you, when was the last time that you really realized that he loves you?
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.920]   He's not just some god sitting on a throne.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.960]   He's not just some sovereign though he is.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   When was the last time that you knew that he loves you?
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:43.640]   My guess is if you can't think of a time, that your heart probably has hardened already.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.680]   That God has become a figurehead to you.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.000]   That God is somebody that you need to appease.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.720]   That somebody that you need to appease so that he can answer your prayers or make you
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.520]   healthy or get a job.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:05.840]   Because you see him as a figurehead but you don't have a personal relationship with him.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:13.280]   But those of you who know him, those of you who taste the goodness of God, where the eyes,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.840]   our eyes have been opened to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for rest, not
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.400]   just the rest of our lives, for rest of eternity, we're going to be looking at that cross and
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:28.320]   asking why did you do this for me?
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   Why did you do this for me?
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   And that hungering and thirsting for righteousness that can only be found in Christ is going
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.800]   to cause you to go to him for rest of eternity.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.420]   I don't think any of us, once we get to heaven, is going to face in any other direction than
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.560]   toward the throne of Christ.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.320]   That's what I think.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:58.000]   It's like going to an NBA championship game and then having your seat turned around and
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.160]   talking to everybody else.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.320]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.860]   Everybody's going to be fixated on the throne of Christ.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.800]   My prayer is not to wait to get to heaven.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.120]   To recognize what it is that we have in Christ and fear lest we drift.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.720]   Be diligent, hold fast, and draw near to the throne of grace.
