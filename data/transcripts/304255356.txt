[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Let me pray for us and then we'll jump into the overview.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.700]   Gracious Father, we want to thank you.
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.860]   We pray, Father, that your word that we've studied would continue to resonate in our
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.860]   hearts.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.900]   Help us, Lord, that it would be more than just knowledge to be able to say that we know
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.260]   what's in here.
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.860]   But we ask, Lord God, that your very heart, your redemptive plan, Father, that you've
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.060]   been preparing the nation of Israel to establish a foundation that would cause them to yearn
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.300]   and long for Christ, that that would have the same effect in our hearts, that there
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.900]   would be a burning and greater desire for him as a result of all that we know.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.200]   And so we ask, Lord God, that you would help us to review and that this review would cause
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700]   us, Lord God, to seek you more.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.700]   Amen.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.700]   All right.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.780]   All right, so as you guys know, as we were studying the book of Leviticus, Leviticus
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.380]   is one of those books that my guess is if you were to meet other, you know, friends
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.060]   who are Christians, I mean, very few people have any knowledge about what's in this book.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.700]   But I think most of you will agree if you were with us for the duration of the study
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.180]   that not only is it important, it is essential.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.180]   It is essential for us to understand the things that are taught in the New Testament.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.580]   If you have a vague knowledge of what Christ was doing through the book of Leviticus, when
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.380]   Christ shows a lot of the terminology, whether it's atonement, cleansing, pure, impure, tabernacle,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.380]   like all of these stuff, atonement, all of these things are embedded in the book of Leviticus.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.740]   And so without it, we start to add our own understanding, our own meaning behind it.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.420]   So again, scripture makes it clear.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.740]   Part of the reason why I'm going to be jumping into the book of Hebrews is for that reason.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.380]   I think once we're done with Romans, probably at the end of this year and sometime next
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.580]   year, early next year, we're going to jump into the book of Hebrews.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.760]   And Hebrews is what connects the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.900]   And so much of the teaching of Hebrews is the fulfillment of Christ, all of this stuff.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.220]   It's not going to go into all the details, but so much of what's taught in the book of
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.140]   Leviticus and how ultimately it was pointing to Christ and how it was fulfilled in Christ.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.460]   And so that's what book of Hebrews is.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.060]   And so we're going to jump into that on Sundays.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.460]   And then most likely on weekdays, we're going to be doing inductive Bible studies.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.060]   So some of you guys who are new to the church, has only been here for maybe last, maybe two
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.140]   to three years.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.340]   You may or may not have done that, but that's sort of what we've been doing in the church.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.140]   And we're going to be jumping back into that to kind of, and it's going to require a lot
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.260]   more of your participation.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260]   It's not going to be just me standing up here teaching you what it says.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.780]   We're going to kind of work through passage to passage, asking you guys to go and do your
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.700]   study and you're going to do a lot of time discussing what you studied in your small
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   groups.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.540]   And then I'm going to be guiding that process.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.540]   Okay.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.100]   So I'm leaning more toward Colossians.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.380]   I said Thessalonians last time, but I'm leaning toward Colossians.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.660]   It's not a hundred percent.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.380]   If tomorrow something happens and then, you know, supernaturally I'm directed toward another
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.940]   path I might, but I'm leaning toward Colossians just to give you a heads up.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.300]   And so in our next Bible study session, it was going to start second week of January,
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.700]   I believe most likely we're going to get into that.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.220]   And again, the format is going to be a little bit different because I'm not just going to
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.220]   be standing here lecturing.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.660]   I'm going to give you study questions and show you how to do that kind of study so that
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.020]   you can do that and then participate in your small group.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020]   Okay.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.100]   So that's where we're headed.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.740]   Just to kind of give us a introduction, Hebrews 8, 3 to 5, it says, "For every high priest
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.620]   is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.100]   So it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer."
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.060]   And again, part of the Leviticus study teaches us that the priests themselves have to be
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.580]   constantly cleansed, right?
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.780]   And they constantly had to be consecrated, you know, for them to even serve.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.060]   And that's what he's referring to.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.140]   Now, if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all since there are those who
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.340]   offer the gifts according to the law, referring to Christ, who serve a copy of the shadow
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.900]   of the heavenly things.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.300]   So everything that we studied in the book of Leviticus, he calls it a shadow.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.680]   It's a reflection of what is actually happening up in heaven, right?
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.220]   And so Moses, he goes up and he sees the heavenly things and God tells them in the book of Exodus
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.620]   to make a copy of this down on earth.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.580]   So everything that we're doing here in the book of Leviticus was, again, a shadow of
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.740]   the reality that was in heaven.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.000]   Hebrews chapter 10, verse 1, "For the law, since it has only shadowed the good things
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.940]   to come and not the very form of things," right?
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.460]   The law was never intended to be the end in and of itself.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.140]   The law ultimately pointed to something, which is obviously fulfilled in Christ.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.860]   It can never, by the same sacrifices, offer continually year after year, make perfect
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.120]   those who draw near.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.460]   So God's intent was never through these sacrifices to bring them any closer to God in reality,
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.900]   because it was just a shadow that was going to point to Christ.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.380]   So that is made very clear in the book of Hebrews, right?
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.940]   And then finally, Colossians 2, 16 to 17, "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.820]   in regard to food or drink or in respect to festivals or new moon or Sabbath day."
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.520]   He's referring to Jews who couldn't let go of the Levitical teachings, because they didn't
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.160]   understand that Christ came and fulfilled all of that.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.600]   He said, "Let no one judge you.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.520]   Even though this is the way you were taught, now we're in a new covenant."
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.140]   And he said, "The things which are mere shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.140]   to Christ."
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.440]   So now that Christ is here, all that is fulfilled.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.920]   So we're no longer bound to these laws.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.120]   That's clear.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.480]   So if we don't understand that, we said that from the very beginning, if you study the
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   book of Leviticus detached from how it is fulfilled in Christ, you can't understand
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.740]   what it says.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.580]   And it is not relevant, right?
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.400]   The teaching of certain kind of animals and women in menstrual cycles and the value of
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.260]   a human being, all of these things aren't going to make sense if you don't understand
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.100]   how it points to Christ.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.240]   How it points to him, how it points to eternity, how it points to the gospel.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.880]   And so that's what we've been doing through the studies, right?
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.680]   So some of you who jumped in in the middle, if you were confused as to what we were doing
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.120]   in this study, all of it, ultimately, every study, like what does this teach us about
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.720]   Christ?
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.320]   Exodus concluded the tabernacles constructed in glory of the Lord.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.080]   So if you look at that, Moses goes up the mountain and the teaching is don't let the
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   people come.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.120]   So in the book of Exodus, when God draws near, the immediate teaching is they cannot come.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   If they come, they will surely die because this is a holy mountain.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   So in verse 35, Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.320]   settled on it.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:25.440]   And so again, so Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers is three consecutive sections of Israel's
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440]   history.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.560]   Exodus is the beginning of Israel's relationship as a nation to God.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.040]   And so Exodus begins by establishing that God wants to draw near, but he can't draw
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   near in the state that they're in.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.720]   So Exodus 20, 19, "Then they said to Moses, 'Speak to us yourself and we will listen,
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   but let not God speak to us or we will die.'"
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.000]   So not only did God tell them to stay, but people understood that even just hearing his
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.480]   voice would instill terror in them.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.360]   So they're begging Moses that don't let him speak to us.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.600]   Let speak through, through you, right?
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.520]   So there was an understanding of his holiness that people just didn't run to God.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.280]   You know, here's our living water and we want to be restored to the Father.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   Immediately they understood.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.120]   And that's the first thing that we understand about our relationship with God.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.980]   The beginning of our relationship with God always begins with a deeper, more sensitive
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.400]   awareness of our own sins.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.280]   There's nobody that can come to God until he genuinely and actually repents of his sins.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.520]   Right?
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.780]   That's where justification happens.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.160]   Repentance isn't just, "Yeah, yeah, you know, there's things that I've done that
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   those are no good."
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   Right?
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.960]   That real encounter with God causes that individual to recognize his sins.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.680]   And repentance isn't just verbal.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.880]   It's everything that you recognized before you met Christ was sinful.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.920]   And that's what happens in Exodus.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.160]   God draws near, they recognize he's holy, and terror falls upon them.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.120]   That's Exodus.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.560]   But God doesn't want to stay distant.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.640]   He wants to draw near.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.360]   So Leviticus, the book that we're studying, God draws near, "Then the Lord called to
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.160]   Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting."
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.120]   In other words, he didn't just come in their midst.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.980]   He was hidden at the tent of meeting, behind the veil.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.080]   So his intent was, "I'm going to come live among you, but the only way that you can come
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   is through this sacrificial system.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.520]   You have to be covered by the blood."
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   Right?
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.120]   So he's inviting them to come, but before they come, all these sacrifices needed to
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.120]   be made.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.760]   They need to be able to distinguish between what is and isn't from God, what is clean,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.200]   what is unclean.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:51.120]   Basically, the whole system had to be set up to teach them that as a sinner, that you'd
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   have to go through this system to come to me.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.440]   Now, all of this ultimately is to point to what Christ was going to do in reality.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.840]   So the very beginning of the book of Leviticus, the very first word, "Wakra," which means
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.000]   "he called," that's the very first word in Leviticus is "he called."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.400]   And that's the whole theme of the book of Leviticus.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:20.600]   It's about his holiness, but it's him calling his people to himself.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.560]   And then the book of Numbers, where after the sacrificial system is started, it's going,
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.080]   and then now he begins to meet people in the tent.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.880]   So the theme of the book of Numbers is God dwelling in their midst.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.320]   So that's the introduction.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.280]   Again, this is nothing new to you.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.320]   This is kind of like the picture of the tabernacle.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.040]   Remember I shared with you, I think it was at, it was a church nearby here where they
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.580]   actually set up a life-size version of the tabernacle.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.480]   And I was expecting a much bigger, I thought it was going to be maybe a couple football
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.320]   field length, and considering how much sacrifice and how many people it served.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.720]   And when I actually went and saw the actual size, it was pretty darn small.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.760]   The size would have been probably maybe from pole to pole, maybe about that length, and
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   then maybe that width.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.360]   And then I thought, "Wow, this served over a million people?"
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.500]   But you could see the wisdom behind that because this was not meant to be permanent.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.200]   Every time that they needed to move, they needed to tear it down and put it back up.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.760]   So imagine if it was the size of two football fields and they had to carry that around.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:37.280]   So practically speaking, God wanted the tabernacle to be like a tent that they could tear down
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.360]   and move out.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.520]   And so that's a picture of the tabernacle.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.360]   I don't know if you can see it, but the color here is supposed to be bright red.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.540]   We don't have good, you know, you can't see it well, but this bright red.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.640]   So in that tabernacle, if you look at the previous picture, it's all pristine and clean,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.300]   but you can imagine if there was sacrifice taking place morning and night, every single
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.480]   day, all the time, you can imagine how bloody this place was.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.440]   They probably dried it up and cleaned it up when they were moving out, but when they set
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.120]   up and it was actually working, you could probably smell the sacrifice and see the blood
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.680]   all over the place all the time.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.880]   Because remember, they didn't just sacrifice, they took the blood and they sprinkled it
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.320]   all over the altar, all over the curtain, all the time.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.680]   So you could imagine how bloody this scene was, right?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.200]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.220]   Because scripture clearly teaches us without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.880]   of sins.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.560]   And we learned that later in the book of Hebrews.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:43.080]   And so Israelite had a visual presentation of that constantly in their myths.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.840]   That in order for us to be in the midst of a holy God, there must be shedding of blood.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:54.760]   So there was a visual presentation of this blood and the sacrifice constantly in their
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   myths.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.480]   And this is the only way that they can get to God.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.240]   So that was embedded into their culture.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.560]   This is the picture of the way that the tabernacle would have been set up.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   So here's the tabernacle.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.760]   These four are the tribes of Levites who kind of stood in between.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   And these are the 12 tribes.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.840]   And this is how God tells them in the book of Numbers to set up.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   Meaning that the tabernacle was at the center of the camp.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.640]   It wasn't like at the bottom of the mountain and then everybody else camped on the other
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   side.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   God's holy presence was in their myths constantly.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:41.400]   So the sacrifice, the smell, the dying animals was a constant part of this society.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.480]   And again, what did it teach them?
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.880]   Because the beginning of Leviticus is, "Come.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:56.920]   In order for you to come, sinful people, to come to me, this must take place."
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.200]   We've gone through this several times, so I'm not going to go through it in too detail.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.640]   But the book of Leviticus, again, remember it's divided into a chiasm.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.520]   And in the chiasm, where's the main thrust?
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.280]   In the middle.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.680]   So if you were writing a paper, you want to say, "This is my thesis and here's my five
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.520]   points to support the thesis."
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.400]   Or sometimes you would give the story and say, "This is the main point."
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.840]   But in a chiasm, it's in the middle.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.320]   And what's in the middle?
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.680]   Day of Atonement.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   The Day of Atonement.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.900]   So the whole point of a chiasm is to highlight what they're trying to say.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.720]   So up to chapter 16, it builds up to the Day of Atonement.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.680]   You are in need of these sacrifices, that you need to have blood sacrificed, the priest
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.760]   needs to be this way, and then they give the first sacrifice and then the two men die because
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.360]   they don't follow the rules.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.140]   And then it points to the Day of Atonement, meaning that you can't come to the holy God
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.680]   without the Day of Atonement.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.200]   And then the other part of it is, again, to point back to that.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.960]   It's kind of like the Bible.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.120]   The Bible kind of prepares us to the New Testament, the Gospels.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.720]   And then we have Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and then the rest of the New Testament
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.840]   points back to the Gospel.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.680]   So you can kind of say that four Gospels is kind of like the Day of Atonement.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.200]   So the whole Bible is in this chiastic form, right?
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.480]   Kind of.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.880]   But that's how human redemptive history is organized.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.040]   Everything leads up to the Gospel, and everything points back to the Gospel.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.440]   So the difference between the first chiastic structure and the second chiastic structure
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:46.240]   is, the first chiastic structure is about the tabernacle, the system, the priesthood,
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.000]   the sacrifices, the altar, and all of that.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.860]   The second part of it points to the life of the believers in the camp, right?
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.000]   So holiness in the tabernacle, which leads to the holiness in the camp.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.240]   And that's the two big divisions in Leviticus.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   And all of it possible because of what the Day of Atonement represents.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:13.840]   So what is that a picture of?
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.520]   The Day of Atonement, clearly, right?
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   The tabernacle.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.080]   So one gets sacrificed, the other one, called the scapegoat, where the priest would put
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.440]   his hand, the high priest, representing the sins of the nations, to be cast out.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.520]   And that was something that they did every year.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.920]   Now, why did they do this when they were constantly sacrificing all year?
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.520]   What did this teach?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.240]   I mean, they had those five major sacrifices every single day.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.200]   The burnt offering was happening morning and night every single day.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.440]   What was the need for the Day of Atonement?
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.480]   Remember what it taught the nation of Israel?
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.720]   That even with the sacrifices, the sins of Israel would pile up.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.320]   It was kind of like spring cleaning, right?
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:08.280]   So in other words, that even with the daily rituals, that the sin would never depart from
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.320]   Israel, right?
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   It was constant.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.960]   It was a constant reminder of need for atonement.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.640]   Remember the five major sacrifices?
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   What are they?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   To yell it out, what's the first one?
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   Burnt offering.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.560]   What's the significance of that?
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.120]   It's burnt, right?
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.680]   Or what's another word for that?
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.680]   Whole offering.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.360]   Why do they call it whole offering?
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.520]   Right, because the whole thing is burnt, right?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.400]   And so it signified, right, and that was the most common, most important of the offerings
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.220]   because it was for general atonement.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.600]   And so that was the offering that was burnt morning and night all the time, constantly,
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   for general atonement.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   Okay, grain offering.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.000]   What did the grain offering do?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.480]   It was for dedication, for tithing, the first fruits, right?
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.880]   And then peace offering.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.100]   And what did the peace offering symbolize?
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.000]   What was unique about the peace offering?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.520]   It was a picnic.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   So that's the offering where they burnt up the parts that they wouldn't eat and the parts
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.200]   that were edible, they kept and then they had a picnic.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.160]   And symbolizing that peace with God established peace with man.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:37.160]   And what was the fourth offering?
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.480]   Sin offering.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.080]   Sin offering is when you defiled something, right?
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.760]   It was set apart for God, you shouldn't have touched it, or it was an offering that was
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.480]   his and you shouldn't have, or you became defiled, right?
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.240]   Because you touched something you shouldn't have or you ate something you shouldn't have
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.640]   eaten and so you gave the sin offering for that.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.680]   And then the fifth one is guilt offering.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:05.940]   What is that for?
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.280]   When you wrong somebody, maybe somebody was giving an offering and you touch it and you
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:19.000]   defile it and as a result of that you pay them back plus, right, one fifth, right?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.120]   So remember when I was starting to, Leviticus, where they would often, God would require
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.400]   that they would give one fifth, remember?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.600]   That was all pointing back to the guilt offering, okay?
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.960]   The reason why these five major offerings are important is because it's the fundamental
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.300]   teaching in the New Testament how we understand offering, right?
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   What was given to God?
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:46.360]   Like when we talk about worship, right, when we're talking about atonement, tithing, giving,
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.040]   sacrifice, like what does it point to in the book of Leviticus?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.200]   So a lot of these things that when we study Hebrews and other parts of the New Testament
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.040]   and Jesus' teaching, when you understand these five offerings, you'll oftentimes be
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   doing quiet times like, "Oh, this sounds a lot like the peace offering."
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.360]   Or you'll be doing quiet times like, "Oh, this sounds a lot like the guilt offering."
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.760]   So when you damage someone else or you wrong somebody, you don't just say, "Hey, I'm
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.440]   sorry," and then you move on, right?
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.320]   God made it so that in the sacrifice, you have to compensate, right?
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   The damage is done.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.760]   So again, this is kind of embedded into Israel's history.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.600]   That's chapters one through seven.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:34.320]   Chapter eight and nine is the ordination of Aaron and his children to prepare them to
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.680]   begin to offer sacrifices, and then what happens in chapter 10?
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:46.180]   Very first offering that's given after the instruction, they didn't follow the rules.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.880]   It wasn't like they were blaspheming God.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.280]   It wasn't like they gave some, you know, like did idol worship.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.560]   They gave strange, they didn't follow instruction, and it was enough to get them consumed, capital
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.960]   punishment.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.600]   So what do you think this taught the nation of Israel?
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.880]   Take it very, very seriously, right?
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.920]   When I say don't touch, don't touch.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.440]   When I say move, move.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:18.480]   When I say to put on the proper garment, put on the proper garment, because God is holy,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   right?
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.560]   God is holy, and so whatever he says is very, very weighty.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.880]   That's why he says repeatedly over and over to the nation of Israel, "Do not turn from
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.040]   my word to the left or to the right.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.800]   Don't tweak it to make it fit you.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.280]   Do exactly as I say," right?
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.520]   So the nation of Israel, they were already afraid of God, right?
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.400]   Remember, they were telling Moses like, "Don't have him speak to us directly because we're
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   afraid."
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.940]   So imagine how afraid they were after this, right?
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.540]   So Nadab and Nevih, who through their example, saying, "Exact, follow exactly as I say because
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.840]   you cannot come to a holy God on your own terms," right?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.800]   That's what he was trying to teach them.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.680]   Chapter 11, we had the distinction between clean and unclean.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   Do you guys remember?
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.560]   I'm not going to ask you to remember all of it.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.080]   There's different theories as to why these distinctions were made, but the one that I
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:22.040]   thought made the most sense, and this is probably the most popular view, some have like a hygienic
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.160]   view.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.120]   So if you talk to, I think, the Seventh-day Adventists, they'll say, you know, the things
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.680]   that God said was unclean is because it's not healthy for us.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.160]   It could be, right?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.420]   But remember what we talked about?
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.920]   Maybe that it pointed to something pagan that we don't know of.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.600]   That was another view.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.520]   The view that made the most sense, there were four views, I gave two, but the view that
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:56.120]   made the most sense is that every animal that he points out is some kind of a deviance of
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.640]   what God originally intended.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.080]   Now I'm not going to go too deep into that.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.920]   You can go look at your own notes.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.400]   In other words, everything that he considered clean or unclean was directly linked to what
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.280]   God originally intended and what kind of went astray.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.000]   So I'm not going to go too deep into that.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.800]   You can go back and look at your notes.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.220]   And so that applies even to human beings, even to land, even to the use of land.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.520]   Everything that God intended, that's been tainted, and it's not being used the way God
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520]   intended.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:32.560]   So that's why a human being who was defected in any way was considered unclean.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.200]   He couldn't serve as a priest.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.720]   So, well, that doesn't sound fair.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.780]   All of that was to teach that sin has caused all these deviance.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.040]   Even if it is not a moral failure, physically it wasn't what God intended and considered
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   unclean.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:55.280]   If you have no idea what I'm talking about, go back to your notes and look it up.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.320]   Remember the purification law for the childbearing?
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:05.560]   What we would consider probably the most sacred time between a mother and son in the book
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.280]   of Leviticus, it says she becomes unclean.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.920]   And then if she has a daughter, she becomes twice unclean.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   Right?
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.080]   There's a lot of things that would very much offend the world if they don't understand.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.960]   Remember while we talked about that?
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.240]   All of this again points to the original sin.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   Right?
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.720]   So all of this, again, like if you don't understand it in the larger context of the
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.760]   gospel, it's like, "What?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.960]   How can he possibly say this?"
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.200]   But again, all of this is to point to the fulfillment ultimately in Christ.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   So the childbirth represents not a beautiful life coming into the world, but another sinner
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.040]   coming into the world.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.560]   Right?
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.200]   Chapter 13 to 15 talks about leprosy.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.360]   Remember what we talked about with leprosy?
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.400]   A visual presentation of sin.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:03.360]   Now there's nothing in the Bible that says leprosy equals sin, but it is often referred
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.200]   to like leprosy, like sin like leprosy.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.920]   And so it went into the details of the devastation of sin or leprosy and how they were isolated,
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.160]   and there was no cure for it.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.920]   They were just put outside and then the priest would come to check to see if they get healed.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   Right?
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:26.960]   The majority of the time it was not, but that's all, they just had to wait for God's mercy.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.680]   And that's what leprosy pointed to.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.800]   So all of this was a setup for what?
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.760]   What comes after chapter 15?
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.600]   All of this is a setup for the day of atonement.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   Right?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.800]   And that's the first chiastic side.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.280]   Then after that, chapter 17 is where it says, "Without the shedding of blood, there is no
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.460]   forgiveness of sin.
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.460]   Life is in the blood."
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.520]   And then so chapter 17 is again for the sacredness of the blood.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:57.720]   So chapter 16 and 17 oftentimes is lumped together in the outline.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:07.160]   Remember what chapter 18 was and why those two figurines are up there?
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:18.540]   Those are pictures of Baal and Asherah, and they both represent what kind of fertility.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.340]   It's the male/female version, right?
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.120]   Baal is the male and Asherah is the female of the fertility idols.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.200]   And remember chapter 18, what it was about?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   Sexual morality.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.600]   And it detailed all kinds of sexual deviance, right?
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.220]   Between mother and child, between aunt and uncle, between sisters.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.380]   I mean, it just goes into perversion after perversion.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:49.000]   And so it's interesting that after the day of atonement, in application, the very first
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:58.240]   thing that it mentions about deviance in our sins is sexual morality, right?
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.840]   And that's true even in the New Testament.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.800]   There's one sin where we are told not to fight.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.360]   It says to do what?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.640]   To flee sexual morality.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.720]   So if you look at all the different sins that are listed, almost always the first on that
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.080]   list is sexual morality.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.720]   So it is not by accident that after the day of atonement, in application, that you need
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.260]   to be holy, and the first thing that comes out is sexual morality.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:36.960]   That if we practice sexuality by our own standards, and we justify sexual morality by what we
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.480]   think is right or by the standard of this world, that's the first thing that the Bible
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   tackles.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.840]   Because that's where perversion happens.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.320]   What God intended between husband and wife, when that gets perverted, it perverts everything
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   else.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.840]   It perverts every other relationship when the marriage is perverted.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.760]   Okay?
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   And then he says to be holy.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.180]   Remember we talked about that in verse, chapter 19?
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:10.560]   He says to be holy and then not practice sexual morality, and then chapter 19, he talks about
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.880]   being holy, but what does that holiness look like in verse chapter 19?
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.020]   Compassion.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.080]   Even to the aliens and strangers.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.240]   Remember we talked about that, how we typically think of holiness as refraining from something
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:32.160]   that is filthy, but in chapter 19, holiness means to practice godliness.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.920]   Holiness literally means to be set apart.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.600]   Set apart for what purpose?
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.360]   For God's use.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   To be like God.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.680]   That's what it means to be holy, to be like God.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:49.160]   And so God has two things that was represented on the cross, his righteousness and his compassion.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.480]   Right?
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.600]   And so holiness isn't simply refraining, so it's not like, "Oh, you guys emphasize holiness,
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.000]   we're about grace."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.540]   Holiness encompasses both.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.240]   You practice one without the other, you don't have the cross.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.280]   If you're righteous without grace, what are you?
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   Self-righteous?
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.040]   Judgmental?
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.720]   If you practice grace without righteousness, what are you?
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.720]   Worldly?
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   Lawless?
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   Right?
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.200]   You can't have one without the other.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.480]   So holiness represents both.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.640]   Grace and righteousness without compromise.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.920]   And that's what the cross represents, where the perfect union of God's righteousness and
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.160]   God's mercy was displayed for the world to see.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   Right?
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.520]   And that's the day of atonement.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.640]   That wrath that should have gone onto that animal, God placed on him and then cast out.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.760]   So God's holy judgment and God's holy compassion displayed at the day of atonement, which is
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.520]   the cross.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.040]   And then it goes into the regulations, who can and cannot serve as a priest.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.520]   Just like prior, it's about clean and unclean animals, and then we come to this side of
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.320]   the kiosk about who can and cannot serve as a priest, and that happens...
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.120]   I should have made it a different color.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.000]   The chapter, I think, 20, and then chapter 21.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.800]   Chapter 23 is about the different Jewish feasts and all of these, right?
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.280]   We're going to spend time with every single one of them and how it ultimately is fulfilled
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   in Christ.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.760]   So if you know these festivals well, it'll help you to understand the gospels much better.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.320]   Right?
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320]   If you know these well.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:39.160]   The Feast of Booth, when Jesus says, "I am the light," it is connected to that because
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.680]   he says that in the context of the Feast of Booth.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.120]   And the Feast of Booth was in the context of waiting for the Messiah to come and deliver
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   them.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.200]   They lit candles everywhere, right?
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.960]   Thinking that the light is going to come into the world, and Jesus looks at that and he
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.640]   says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.360]   The light that you're waiting for, he's here.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   So when you understand these feasts, it helps you to understand what Jesus was saying in
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.120]   the context of the gospels.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.240]   Again, all of this fulfilled in Christ.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.880]   Chapter 24 is where the Israelites make a commitment.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.080]   We are going to follow you.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.080]   They commit.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.360]   And then, remember, this is in the holy of...
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.720]   Right before the room, the holy room, they lit a candle, which represented the prayers.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.800]   And then they have the...
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:32.840]   Again, this is as far as they were able to go before they entered.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.440]   So this was a constant reminder to them of the presence of God, chapter 24.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:43.320]   Chapter 25, if you remember, about the year of Jubilee, right?
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.960]   Remember we talked about that, so you guys may remember how God punished the nation of
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.440]   Israel for not practicing the Sabbath year, right?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.920]   Every seventh year that they were supposed to give the land rest.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.120]   And as a result of that, later on in Israel's history, that they are taken into captivity
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.680]   how many years?
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.320]   70 years, right?
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   And for 70 years, they didn't practice.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.520]   It was supposed to happen every seventh year.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.800]   So seven times 70 is 490 years.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.880]   Where was that brought up in the New Testament?
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.840]   When Peter asked, "How many times should I forgive my brother?"
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.080]   Seven times, and then he said, "Seven times 70," meaning 490 years.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.160]   So it wasn't just a random number.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.680]   This was how long God was patient with the nation of Israel.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.320]   And that's where that comes in.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.040]   Remember the blessings and curses?
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:47.640]   The blessings were, the curses were twice as long.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.000]   In the book of Deuteronomy, it's actually even longer than that.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.840]   So if you don't obey my commandment, these things are going to happen.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.040]   And so this was foretelling of the nation of Israel and all sinners, right?
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.160]   So if you were careful and you were paying attention, by the time you get to the end
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.680]   of the book of Malachi, all of these curses that are mentioned have been piled up year
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   after year, king after king, generation after generation, right?
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.840]   So when Paul says in Romans chapter 7, "Oh, what a wretched sinner I am.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.880]   Who will deliver me from this body of sin?"
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.640]   That that's what it was supposed to lead the Jew to, to that point, right?
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.360]   "Oh, what a wretched sinner I am."
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.480]   Because it wasn't, the law wasn't going to make them righteous.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.360]   The law was going to reveal their unrighteousness.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.120]   So what I do, I want, you know, I don't do what I don't want to do.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.400]   I keep on doing, "Oh, what a wretched man that I am."
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   So all of this was to lead to that, right?
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.320]   And remember, we talked about it and I mentioned it last Sunday, the blessings, all the blessings
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   of God is just to restore what God originally intended, right?
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.120]   It wasn't anything supernatural, right?
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.040]   Or at least we think it's supernatural, but it's what God intended from the beginning
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.240]   in creation.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.320]   And then it ended with chapter 27, chapter 27, evaluation and all of this pointing to
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.000]   redemption, right?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.360]   So we can easily get caught up into the details, but the whole point of all of this is God
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.040]   ends with redemption.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:23.120]   It is an assumption that man is sinful and in his need of redemption, right?
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.120]   And that's how the book ends.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:28.800]   So it doesn't end with, you know, "God is so gracious, he's going to deliver us."
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.440]   It ends with, you're going to make a vow and you're not going to be able to keep it.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.240]   And then when you don't keep it, this is what you need to do.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.240]   God's going to give you an opportunity to be redeemed and that's how it ends.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.600]   And it points to the one who's going to come who's going to redeem, okay?
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.400]   So that's the whole point of Leviticus.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.080]   My hope is, even if you don't know every detail of the book of Leviticus, when you read the
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.840]   New Testament, that certain things that you'll read is going to be highlighted and you're
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.520]   going to remember and at least go back to this chapter and read because it'll help you
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:10.200]   to really understand at another level what God was doing through the nation of Israel,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   okay?
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.080]   All right, so the rest of the time, I'm going to have you guys...these are the study questions
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.520]   that I gave.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.240]   And you're not bound to this in your small group.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.600]   If you want to take some time more to pray, that's up to you.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.520]   But this is just kind of in summary.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.400]   And you've already discussed this before, but since today is an overview study, if you
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.880]   can take some time to just ask, you know, what did you learn about God in the study
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   of Leviticus?
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.820]   This is something that you should be asking in every study, right?
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:45.400]   But since this is kind of an end summary study, what did it reveal about yourself?
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:51.480]   And my hope is that every study you do, that you would be reflective and ask, like, what
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.320]   is it that I need to be changing in my thought, in my life, right?
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.680]   And how should I be applying this?
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.840]   We don't just become hearers of the Word, but doers, okay?
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.240]   So take some time to discuss these questions and take some time to pray.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.640]   And then, again, right after I pray, Pastor Mark, do you have an announcement?
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.640]   Okay.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   The new people?
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   Okay.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.640]   All right.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.440]   So let me pray for us, and then Pastor Mark's going to do that.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.840]   And then if some of you, okay, can help us out, just take the chairs and put these chairs
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   on this side and this chair on this side.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.840]   Okay.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.840]   Let's pray.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:39.800]   Gracious Father, we want to thank you, Lord God, for our study in the book of Leviticus.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.880]   And we pray, Father, that the insights that we were able to glean, and we know there's
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.280]   still so much in there, Lord God, that we still don't fully understand.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.160]   Help us, Lord, that the study of Leviticus would open up the New Testament for us.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   And let me understand the depth of your love, the depth of your grace, Lord God, that you've
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:08.080]   prepared for so many years, that we would see the gospel in a completely different light,
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.520]   that we would understand, Lord, not only your word, but your very heart.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:16.280]   So we pray for your blessing over the time of our study, and we pray, Father God, that
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.460]   our discussion time will be fruitful.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.660]   Help us to be open.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.320]   Help us to truly experience fellowship during this time.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.320]   Amen.
