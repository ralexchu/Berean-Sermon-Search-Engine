[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Romans chapter 9 verses 1 through 5, we're going to be focused on verse 4 through 5 today.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.560]   I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.320]   My conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.200]   anguish in my heart.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200]   For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.560]   brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.600]   They are Israelites and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.220]   of the law, the worship, and the promises.
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.400]   To them belong the patriarchs and from their race according to the flesh is the Christ
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.000]   who is the God over all, blessed forever.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Amen.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.480]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your word.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.080]   We want to thank you for your servant, Apostle Paul, that through his labor and sacrifice
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.480]   that you've given us the book of Romans to wrestle, to be comforted, to be challenged,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   and at times even rebuked, that we may live according to the calling of the gospel of
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520]   Jesus Christ.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   We pray that you would give us insight, help us to understand what you meant, that you
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.480]   would take the blinders off of our eyes, the sinful filter sometimes that we use to understand
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.200]   your word.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.920]   We pray that your Holy Spirit would get to the heart of who we are and where we are,
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.880]   that we may see a clear vision of Christ and what he has done.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.160]   Help us, Lord God, to be simple-minded people, people with childlike faith who simply desires
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.080]   to worship you and to be near you.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.120]   We pray all the distractions, Lord, that we brought into this room.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.640]   Help us, Lord, to take our eyes off of these things and fixate it upon Christ and Christ
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160]   alone.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.320]   I pray that your word would be powerful and your word alone may be taught and listened
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   and obeyed.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.120]   Again, I want to just kind of bring us back in our mind and our thinking to where we are
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.920]   in the book of Romans.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   Apostle Paul has taken eight chapters to exposit and to dive into the gospel message.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.760]   He started out with, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Jews and Gentiles
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   alike."
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.120]   And he brought us through details of what Christ has done.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.560]   And his message in the eight chapters is the most clearest presentation of Christ and what
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.720]   he has done for us on the cross.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.480]   So it's basically the gospel message in depth.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   Now if you've been paying attention carefully and if you were a Jew, Paul already knows
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.320]   what the Jews must have been thinking if they heard this for the first time.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.920]   If they believed that all their assurance, all their security was based upon their law
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.040]   and their special relationship with God.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.360]   And then Paul all of a sudden says that all of that is not real.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.920]   That the very things that you held onto for security is actually going to bring condemnation.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   That the same judgment that the Gentiles are under, you will also be under.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.200]   So Paul already knows that this message is not going to be well received.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.400]   And so in order to nullify the message, they know that the easiest way to do that is to
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.800]   nullify the messenger.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.200]   So Paul begins in chapter 9, 10 and 11 defending his message to the nation of Israel.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.560]   And again, just defending the gospel itself.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.160]   And so we're going to again, chapter 9, 10 and 11, he's going to be describing about
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.920]   his promises to the nation of Israel and how God is still faithful to everything that he
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   has said.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.280]   But he begins the chapter by defending himself.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   He says, "I am not lying.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   I am telling the truth.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.600]   My conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit."
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.720]   In fact he goes even further than that and says, "It's not because I hate the Jews.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.560]   It's not because I have something against the Jews."
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.160]   In fact he says he loves them so much that if it was possible for him to be accursed
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.460]   on their behalf, I would.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.960]   And obviously we know that that is not possible.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.480]   But Paul is trying to convey that my preaching, the gospel message, is the truth.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.920]   That he loves them dearly.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.320]   And then today he's going to be going into details of the privilege of the nation of
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   Israel.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.800]   Again, he's saying all of this so that they could recognize that Paul knows very well
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.280]   where the nation of Israel stands.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.300]   The privilege that they have and why he loves them and why he was so zealous before he met
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   Christ.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.900]   You know in modern day era, when we think about the Jewish people, automatically we
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.340]   think about the Holocaust.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.980]   Because it was horrific.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.380]   Even to this day.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.540]   If something terrible happens or you want to equate somebody with the most horrible
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.620]   act in modern history, we would say, "Oh that guy's like Hitler.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.620]   He's Hitler-esque.
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.620]   He's like the Nazis."
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.180]   Again, that's the worst thing that you can possibly say about a person or a group of
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.660]   people.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.700]   Because they wanted to extinguish all the Jews.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.460]   Six million people, from young children to grandparents, were slaughtered for no other
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.720]   reason other than the fact that they were born into a particular race.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.460]   So in our modern day era, when we think about the Jewish people, we immediately think about
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.300]   the tragedy, the suffering that they went through.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.420]   The Holocaust.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.300]   But from a biblical perspective, the greatest tragedy for the nation of Israel, as horrific
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.520]   as the Holocaust was, was not the Holocaust.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.660]   The greatest tragedy for the nation of Israel is that their Messiah came to save them.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.540]   That all the promises that God made to the nation of Israel for the sake of their own
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.980]   sins to save them from condemnation, almost as a whole, rejected him.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.060]   And they did not recognize his coming.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.180]   And as a result of that, not six millions, and we don't know the exact number in the
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.700]   last 2,000 years, but a much greater number will face condemnation before a holy, holy,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.620]   holy God.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.840]   And this is not just true of the nation of Israel, but for any human being.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.900]   The biggest tragedy in our life is not poverty.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.860]   It's not cancer.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.100]   It's not early death.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.860]   All of these things are horrific things.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.220]   God does call us to stand up for the weak and the orphans and the widows.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.540]   This is part of Christian responsibility.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.140]   But the greatest tragedy, from a biblical perspective, is whether you die young or old,
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.900]   and whether you live to a ripe old age in your 90s, or maybe even beyond 100, the tragedy
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.220]   is not knowing Christ and not recognizing him and dying without the atonement, the free
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.620]   gift of salvation in Christ.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.460]   That's always the greatest tragedy.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.700]   See, Paul is writing in the book of Romans, in particular verses that we're going to be
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.420]   looking at in 4 through 5, he's going to be outlining nine specific blessings that the
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.500]   nation of Israel had.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.660]   The nation of Israel, their tragedy was that God blessed them so tremendously, and yet,
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:22.940]   when Christ came, almost as a whole, they didn't recognize him, and they ended up crucifying
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.780]   him.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.100]   Now before I even get to the end, I'm going to tell you the application of all of this
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.260]   as Christians in modern day era that is not just about the nation of Israel.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:42.580]   In fact, the statistics the last time that I saw was that almost 80% of children who
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.700]   grew up in Christian homes and went to church and went to Sunday school, almost 80% of them
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.440]   walk away from their faith before they turn 30.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.660]   Much of that happens sometime between college and young adult age.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.280]   Now you say, "Well, 80%, that seems kind of high, considering that our church is filled
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.340]   with people in their 20s and 30s."
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.940]   But if you've been a Christian for more than 20, 30 years, you probably already have seen
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.540]   that among your friends, your peers, the people that you walked diligently with when you were
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.180]   younger.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.860]   The tragedy of being in a church and hearing the gospel, attending Awana Sunday school,
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:26.580]   even having family worship, memorizing the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, going
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.620]   to Awana, and even as a young adult, discipleship, short-term missions, and even after I've done
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:39.780]   all that, the reality of the matter is that more than 80% of people who grew up in the
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:47.700]   church with hearing the gospel, surrounded by Bible teaching, surrounded by preaching,
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:55.540]   church, opportunities, fellowship, home groups, accountability, fellowship, beyond what most
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:03.020]   people can barely even imagine that we have, and yet 80% of our generation has fallen out
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.380]   from the church.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:10.400]   See, the tragedy of the nation of Israel is reflective, and it is also a warning to anyone
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.340]   who's been raised in the church, who've been around the gospel, who've been around God's
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.060]   Word, and yet our hearts have become numb and dull.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.500]   And so when Christ comes, we can easily say, "That won't happen to me."
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.940]   If Jesus walks on water and He heals a man who was born blind, He raised people from
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.940]   the dead.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.620]   If I saw that with my eyes, I would not reject Him.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.100]   Maybe.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.980]   But the reality of the nation of Israel is they did.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.300]   He begins by telling us nine things, and I want to go through the nine things that Paul
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.900]   says that they were blessed with.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.420]   And I think every single one of these things, and I'm not going to mention it, but I think
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:01.340]   every single one of these things, to some degree, is reflective of the blessing of being
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.060]   a part of the church.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.060]   One, He says, "They are Israelites."
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.140]   I mean, that may, you may just kind of skim over that when you read it, but to say that
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.540]   you are Israelites automatically meant to the nation of Israel that you were chosen
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.700]   by God.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.620]   The name itself means people who wrestle with God.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:26.980]   That was a name given to Jacob after a long night of wrestling, or the name of Israel.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.220]   And basically that name automatically meant that you were separated from the rest of the
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.220]   nation.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.220]   You were special to God.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.220]   You were not like others.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.740]   Deuteronomy 7, 6, it says, "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.420]   The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for His treasured possession out of all the
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.020]   peoples who are on the face of the earth."
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.380]   The fact that Paul says, "You are Israelites," automatically the Israelites would have understood
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.660]   that we were special.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.060]   That God was among them.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.540]   That they were the ones who were wrestling, and His presence was there.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:10.620]   Secondly, he says to them, "To you, the Jews, belong the adoptions."
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.340]   Not only were they chosen by God, in Exodus 4, 22, it says, "You shall say to the Pharaoh,
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.760]   'Thus says the Lord, 'Israel is my firstborn.'"
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.900]   When we hear the term "firstborn" in our culture context, we mean He's first, second, third,
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.620]   or fourth.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.820]   But God is not saying to the nation of Israel, "Firstborn," as in, "Well, I birthed you,
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.700]   and then I'm going to birth another nation, and then another nation."
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.060]   The term "firstborn" signifies a special blessing upon that particular nation.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.960]   That there's no others.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.820]   Because the firstborn was the one where the inheritance, and the line of the predecessors,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.180]   the ancestors, would go through this particular line.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.880]   That God had a particular purpose.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.560]   And that's what it means to be firstborn.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.460]   So when in the New Testament, Jesus is called the only begotten Son, He's not saying "begotten"
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.100]   as in He created Him out of nothing.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.980]   He's separating Him from all of other things.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.420]   There's no one like Him.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.420]   And that's what He means when He calls a nation of Israel "firstborn."
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.700]   There's no other nation like the nation of Israel.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:22.260]   Hosea 11, 1, it says, "When Israel was a child, I loved him.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.800]   And out of Egypt, I called my son."
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.580]   When God calls a nation of Israel His children, or His son, it's basically saying that He
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.580]   loves them.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.920]   There's special concern, special affection for this nation that is unlike any other nation.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.980]   So if any of my children came and asked me, "Dad, can I come and eat something from the
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.980]   refrigerator?"
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.220]   My answer would be, "You're my son."
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.340]   And what I mean by that is, why would you even ask that?
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.660]   Everything I have is yours.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.140]   What is the kind of relationship that you have with your children that you don't have
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.120]   with anybody else?
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.220]   So when God says to the nation of Israel that you have the adoption, God is saying that
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:12.780]   of all the people that I have fixated my attention and love in particular upon you, not only
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.600]   were they people who contended with God, not only were they chosen to be loved, He says
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.880]   yours is the glory.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.300]   Glory typically signifies God's real presence among His people.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.940]   Glory basically means to magnify His essence.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.900]   That's what glory is.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.660]   So whoever and whatever God is, is being displayed.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.660]   That's what glory is.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:43.980]   So when it says, "Glory is yours," meaning that God drew near to His people.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.820]   He wasn't a God who chose Him from a distance and said, "You know what?
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.820]   I'm going to declare you and put a stamp on Him," and then He disappeared.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.740]   When He says, "Not only were you Israelites, not only are you adopted," He said, "Yours
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:03.120]   is the glory," meaning that they had access to God's presence like no other nation.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   They saw His glory close up.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.800]   They saw the miracles and how He performed miracles, how He fed them through 40 years
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.300]   of the desert.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:18.520]   His glory would appear in the temple and He would rest upon the Holy of Holies permanently.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.520]   And He would be there.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:26.240]   Anytime the Israelites wanted to be in His presence, they could just go to the temple.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.600]   They witnessed the glory of God like no other people.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.360]   Not only were they witnesses of His glory, He said they had the covenant.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.160]   See the covenant is what separated them.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.800]   See today when two people get married, we say, you know, two people get in a covenant.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:51.120]   But a lot of times people don't understand the biblical idea of a covenant.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.440]   Typically we get into contracts.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.400]   Whether you're selling a property or you're going into business with somebody, you make
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.320]   an agreement and you have a signed contract.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.040]   You do your part and I do my part.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:09.400]   The biblical idea of a covenant is God choosing unilaterally to commit Himself to you.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.720]   So when He says yours is a covenant, it's that God separated you to adopt you, to reveal
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.040]   Himself to you in His glory.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.300]   And yours is the covenant.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.620]   He made this covenant to Abraham.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.760]   He repeated to his son Isaac and then to his son Jacob.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.000]   And then He repeated over and over again.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.920]   See this covenant that God made with the nation of Israel was unlike any other covenant.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.880]   That's why over and over again when God reveals Himself to generations that came after Abraham,
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.680]   He would often reveal Himself the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.800]   He's not simply saying that, oh, these three people that started the nation of Israel,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.480]   I mean, that's the same God.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.400]   And that's partially true.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.360]   But by saying He's the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, He's reminding them.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.080]   I am that same God who made covenant with your forefathers and that covenant is still
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   true with you.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   It is that same God.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:17.920]   See when He says He's covenanted, that covenant with the nation of Israel was very special.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.920]   And that's why if you know the story of Jacob and Esau, where Esau was the hairy guy, he's
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.160]   the manly man, right?
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.160]   He's the lumberjack.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.680]   He goes and he goes hunting and then he comes back famished and Jacob's the one who's at
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.840]   home by his mother's side, mama's boy.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.240]   And he comes back and he's famished and he said, give me some soup.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.920]   And he said, well, give me your birthright and I'll give you some soup.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.960]   And Esau being outdoorsy, like man's man, he said, well, what is that to me?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   I'm going to die.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.440]   He's a little bit exaggerating, dramatic.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   And then he said, okay, I'll give you my birthright and he gives it to him.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.640]   And because of that mistake, permanently that birthright was taken away.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.680]   Now we can look at that and say, any of you who have siblings, right?
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   Any of you who have siblings know that that type of conversation happens all the time
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.320]   when you're young, right?
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.400]   Give me your candy, right?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.200]   And I'll do this for you or that for you.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.760]   And it looks like a childish, maybe even a prank and selfishness on Jacob.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.920]   But because of that, God's blessing is upon him and not upon Esau.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.320]   Superficially we may look at that and say, well, that doesn't sound fair or just.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.360]   But do you have to remember the firstborn right, the inheritance in this particular
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.840]   family wasn't unlike any other family.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.960]   Because God covenanted with their predecessors, with their ancestors, that he was going to
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.840]   make, he was going to bless them and make their nation great.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.200]   And eventually the Messiah was going to come through this line.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.880]   So for Esau to forsake his birthright, his inheritance, was to trivialize the covenant
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.660]   that God made with him.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:07.600]   And he wasn't just rejecting the inheritance, meaning property and cows and whatever inheritance,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.440]   whatever inheritance a typical firstborn child would get.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.040]   He was saying, what good is any of that?
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.280]   What good is all the promises of God, all of this to me if I'm hungry?
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.160]   See this covenant that God made with the nation of Israel was unlike any other covenant.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.200]   So he says, you're in Israel.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.640]   You are, you have the adoption.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.940]   You have the glory.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.940]   You have the covenant.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.440]   And if that's not enough, he says, you have the law.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.240]   You know, biblically we say, you know, there's general revelation and there's special revelation.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.460]   Right now I could have general revelation of who you are.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.720]   Some of you didn't sleep last night, right?
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   That's my observation.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.160]   I could see it in your face.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.660]   Some of you are hungry.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.360]   I see it.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   Some of you are excited.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   Some of you are angry.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.000]   You know, typically a lot of people look at me and they say, you know, they think I'm
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.960]   angry because I have this scar on my, or it's not a scar.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   It's just a genetic mark of our family.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.480]   But that's general revelation.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.680]   And oftentimes I have to tell them, actually, I'm very happy.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.400]   You know, I'm not angry.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   You know, people are kind of intimidated to talk because they think I'm angry.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.520]   I have this scowl, right?
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.240]   But there's things that you can know through general revelation.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   You need the general observation that they're not all, you know, they're not all wrong,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320]   but they're not accurate.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.280]   They're not precise.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.200]   So we have general revelation.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.800]   God left an imprint of who he is.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.880]   But we also have special revelation where God speaks directly with languages and his
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.560]   words through poetry.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.120]   And it says to the nation of Israel, you were the first who received the law of God, where
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.120]   God drew near to them and gave them the covenant and he presented his glory to them unlike
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.480]   everybody else.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.920]   And he also spoke to them clearly.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.280]   For what purpose?
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.920]   To reveal himself.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.680]   So there's certain things that you can know about me from a distance, from the way I
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.280]   preach, the way I dress, my scowl and say, well, Peter is like this.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.320]   And then there's some of you had intimate knowledge of because I spent a lot of time
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   with you.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.720]   But you know, nobody knows me like my mom or my brothers or my wife and my kids.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.520]   See, the nation of Israel had special revelation of God through the law.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.880]   John Calvin says there's three particular uses of the law.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.600]   And the first one is a mirror.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.520]   It is a reflection of who God is in every household.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.600]   There are certain rules that you have.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   Right.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.120]   So maybe the father and mother will say in our house, we don't eat with our hands.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:51.080]   We everybody is at the table at five o'clock and finishes at six and very regimented.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.000]   And that's a reflection of the parents.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.140]   It's a reflection of the dad.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.720]   Some houses you go, it's very artsy, you know, paintings everywhere and everything's a little
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   artsy.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.280]   But again, that's a reflection of of the people who are running that house.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.960]   So in every household you go, there's a little bit of the character of the person who owns
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.360]   that house.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.160]   The law, the first thing that it does, it reveals his nature, his character, who he
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.440]   is.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.920]   And they had a special revelation where God spoke to them and said through the law, this
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.980]   is me.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.720]   The law reveals his holiness.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.160]   He talks about how what you should and should not do.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.080]   But oftentimes when we think about the law, we think of condemnation.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:43.380]   But the law also reveals his very gentle, caring, merciful, faithful, forgiving God.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:50.420]   This very law that said if you break the Sabbath, there is condemnation also tells them to save
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.160]   a little piece of your harvest at the end so that the foreigners and the widows, when
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.120]   they come by, they can eat.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.720]   That same law talked about the Jubilee, the forgiving of debt.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.520]   It reveals God's nature.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.400]   It reveals his character.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.600]   What the nations could have kind of known about God because he left his imprint on his
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:17.000]   creation, Israel had firsthand knowledge because God spoke to them directly.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.820]   The law restrains.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.280]   It's a tutor to guide and lead and ultimately reveals his will and his purpose.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:31.000]   So that's why Jesus says in John 4, 22 to the Samaritan woman, you worship what you
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.120]   do not know.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   You kind of have an idea of who God is, but you don't really know him.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.400]   We worship what we do know.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:44.200]   He's talking about the Jewish people for salvation is from the Jews.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.080]   See the scripture talks about how there was a general imprint that God existed and that
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.700]   we ought to worship this God who created us.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:57.760]   But to the nation of Israel, God specifically told them about what sins and how he was going
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.560]   to deal with that sin through the law.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.880]   Not only do they have the law, he says, you have to worship.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.920]   Now the word worship in the New Testament, there's three specific words.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:15.640]   There is the most prominent word, proskuneo, which means to bow down, to prostrate oneself
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.520]   and is the most prominent word where they're confronted by God's presence and they can
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.480]   do nothing but to worship him.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.000]   And true worship is almost always a reaction.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.640]   True worship almost always is when we encounter this God, it causes us to bow down.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.800]   That's true worship.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.320]   Not something, I should say this, I should mean this, but when we're confronted with
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.280]   his true presence, that's proskuneo.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   The other word is sabomai.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.000]   Sabomai basically means to have reverence and emotion.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.280]   When the scripture says to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.800]   God wants not just prostrating oneself, but genuinely from the heart.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.520]   But the word that is used here for worship is latruo.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.760]   Oftentimes the word latruo is translated as worship, but sometimes it's translated as
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.200]   service because that's exactly the meaning of this word.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.600]   And in particular to the Jewish people, it's talking about service at the temple.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:21.120]   So in other words, what Paul is saying is you had the privilege to draw near to God
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.760]   in service and in worship.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   You know, oftentimes when we think about serving the church, it's like, well, I have to do
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.760]   this.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.360]   And we kind of give people guilt trips like, hey, you know, we need to toilet clean and
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.680]   how come we're the only ones cleaning?
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.280]   Why don't you clean it?
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.800]   You haven't volunteered for doing this, so why don't you do it?
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.360]   But Paul said you had the privilege.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.680]   The reason why it was a privilege because the very fact that they're able to approach
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.080]   God was a privilege.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:55.280]   If sin separated us from God, and that's what we lost at the fall because of the sin, the
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   atonement of sin means that we are able to draw near to God.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.680]   And that's the blessing that we have, restoration.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.520]   Oftentimes we think of salvation as not going to hell and going to heaven.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.320]   But what was lost at the fall was the ability to be able to glorify God, the ability to
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.680]   draw near to God.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.040]   So the fact that we are able to worship God, it says, draw near to the throne of grace
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.560]   with confidence because of what Christ has done.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.480]   See, that's the word that is used here, "lutro," you have the worship.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.880]   That every aspect of the temple was a privilege.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.960]   Whether you are a priest sacrificing, whether you carry the poles, whether you cleaned outside,
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.520]   all that was an act of drawing near to God.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.400]   And so you had that privilege of worship.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.920]   And then you had the promises.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.800]   Number seven, God made promises to this particular nation that he would be faithful to them.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.680]   That even in their sins and judgment, God promises that he will restore the remnant.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.440]   He promised them his protection, his provision.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:06.200]   But among all the promises that God made to the nation of Israel, nothing is as more significant
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.240]   than the promise he made of the coming Messiah.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.760]   That every promise that he made to the nation of Israel will be fulfilled when the Messiah
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   comes.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:25.000]   There's over 400 separate prophecies about Jesus' coming, who he is, how he will come,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.320]   what he will look like, what will happen when he comes, how he will die, how he will suffer.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.480]   His perspective as he's hanging on the cross, who will betray him.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.280]   All of that was prophesied.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.520]   John 5, 46, Jesus says, "If you believed in Moses, you would believe in me, for he wrote
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.600]   of me."
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:52.040]   Of all the promises that God made, nothing is more significant than the coming of the
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.360]   Messiah for the sake of their sins.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.720]   And he says, number eight, to them, to you, belong the patriarchs.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.000]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.680]   Hebrews chapter 11 lists a long list of majority Jewish people, patriarchs, who went before
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.080]   them, men of faith.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.400]   And after talking about how these people, because of their faith, did these heroic things,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.960]   he says, "Considering the cloud of witnesses that has gone before us, let us run faithfully.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.360]   The race set before us."
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.160]   So these patriarchs were of their nation.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.920]   It was their people.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.040]   They weren't just studying some history, they were studying history of their own people
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.360]   that went before them.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.120]   Men of faith to follow, women of faith to follow.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.080]   But finally, of all the blessings that God gave the nation of Israel, and I could stop
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.880]   right here and say, "Well, there's no other nation that had this blessing."
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.760]   But above all of that, he says at the end, "And from their race, according to the flesh,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.200]   is the Christ who is God overall, blessed forever.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.380]   Amen."
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.200]   That this Messiah was going to come in your line.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.400]   I mean, can you imagine, you know, every time I open the Bible, I have to consider the cultural
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.860]   context, because I'm not from that culture.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.200]   Every time I open up the scripture and try to figure out what it says, I have to understand
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.280]   the language that they used.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.200]   How did they understand it?
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.320]   See, but the Jews, Jesus was from their culture.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.120]   So when he used his illustration, they knew exactly what he was talking about.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.440]   He talked about the sheep.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.280]   He talked about the various parables.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.080]   It was all within their culture with their own language.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.040]   That every little nuance of his relationship with his mom and his brothers, all of that
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:46.800]   was within their context, because Jesus came from their line and their culture.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:56.760]   That the Messiah, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, came to us as a Jew.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:04.560]   Knowing all of that, how privileged they were, all the blessings and the love and the law
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:13.360]   and the promises and the covenant, the patriarchs, the examples, and Christ himself come into
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.880]   flesh as a Jew.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:25.440]   You would think, if we didn't already know what happened, you would think that when Jesus
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   showed up, that they would have been loyal to him.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.680]   They would have recognized him.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.920]   But they didn't.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.360]   When the scripture says that the light came into the world, but the people did not desire
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.800]   the light, for they desired darkness over the light.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.400]   First and foremost, he's talking about the Jewish people.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.760]   Why did they miss him?
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.880]   That's the big question.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.560]   Before we flippantly just dismiss, "Oh, those Jews, they were so blind.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   How could they have missed him?"
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:00.080]   Just before we just simply dismiss that, we have to ask ourselves, were these people who
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.120]   were so privileged, was eyewitnesses of his glory?
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.040]   It was passed down from generation to generation, how he delivered these people from Egypt,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.720]   from Pharaoh, in a miraculous way.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:19.280]   And every year, they were to tell this to their children as a story over and over, every
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.080]   holiday.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.140]   Everything that they did reminded them about the coming Messiah.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.640]   And yet when he came, they completely missed it.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:40.320]   See, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10, 1 through 13, that all of this is very relevant to us.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.440]   It is an encouragement and as a warning.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.080]   He says in 1 Corinthians 10, 1, he says, "I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.920]   were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all were baptized into Moses in
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.560]   the cloud and in the seas and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.040]   spiritual drink.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.920]   For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was Christ.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:10.120]   Nevertheless, with most of them, God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.320]   Everyone saw the glory.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.560]   Everyone ate the manna.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.900]   Everyone saw the rain.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.860]   Everyone saw his miracles.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:25.540]   And yet most of them turned away from God.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.380]   Why is this so true today?
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.220]   Not just to the nation of Israel.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:39.820]   Why is it that the people who have the greatest blessing on earth, and I'm talking about me
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:45.820]   and you, the privilege that we have, the freedom that we have, the access that we have to his
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:51.700]   words, no other generation, no other place in the world has the kind of freedom and access
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:59.500]   we have to his word, to his church, to the fellowship, to the opportunities, to the worship.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:09.580]   And our greatest lack is not lack of fellowship, lack of opportunities, lack of leadership,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:18.580]   lack of preaching, it's lack of faith, lack of passion, lack of perseverance.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:24.320]   See, Paul says in verse six, "Now these things took place as an example for us that we might
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.420]   not desire evil as they did."
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   So he said all the things that are the tragedy of the nation of Israel, he says, "To serve
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:37.320]   as an example, as a warning to all of us, because we are just as susceptible to this
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.540]   spiritual blindness as they were."
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.100]   He says, there's six things I want to quickly mention here, he says in verse seven through
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.100]   thirteen.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.420]   Number one, he says, "Well what does this look like?
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.740]   Why were they so blind?"
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.140]   The first thing that he says in verse seven, "Do not be idolaters as some of them were,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.820]   as it is written," and he describes this idolatry, and I want you to pay very close attention
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.760]   to what he says.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.100]   This idolatry that he describes as, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play."
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:16.380]   Now that's not, that wasn't their only sin, but that's the first thing that's mentioned.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.940]   He talks about sexual immorality, he talks about other things, but the first, remember
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.660]   in the Bible when they make a list of things, whether it's a list of disciples, list of
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:30.980]   sin, the first is always significant, because they always wrote things in priority or of
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.020]   importance.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.060]   So when he says the Israelites, they all fell away because they fell into idolatry, and
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.260]   here's the first thing.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.740]   "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play."
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:53.980]   I mean that sounds kind of trivial, considering we know what kind of sins that they fell into.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:59.860]   Constant sin of Asherah, worshiping Asherah, Paul and Baal, and chasing after adultery,
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:04.420]   the sexual immoral sins that they committed, forsaking and blasphemy against God, considering
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:11.100]   all of these things, that that would be the first thing?
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.820]   He says in Hosea chapter 13, 5, "I cared for you," he's talking about the nation of Israel,
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.460]   "I cared for you in the desert, in the land of burning heat.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.320]   When I fed them, they were satisfied.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   When they were satisfied, they became proud, and then they forgot me."
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.700]   The beginning of all their sins was apathy.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.740]   The beginning of all their idolatry, the sexual immorality, everything that caused them to
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:45.300]   be so blind, how can they have so much blessing, special revelation, the covenant, the worship,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:53.580]   the ancestors, Christ himself coming in their flesh, in their culture, and they were so
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.940]   spiritually dense that they did not recognize him.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.960]   How did it start?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:09.500]   They sat, they ate, they drank, they played.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:15.140]   What causes our hearts to be more hardened than anything else is not persecution, it's
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.780]   not fear, it's distraction.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.560]   It's distraction.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.160]   Overly concerned about things that don't matter.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.460]   They're not sinful, they're not things that we are naturally ashamed of, these are things
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:36.100]   that we regularly participate in, they're not sinful, but we're just overly distracted
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.660]   by the things that don't matter.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:46.780]   See, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 32, in argument for the resurrection, he says, "If
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.340]   the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:58.780]   He's not saying this, he's not saying this as an encouragement or anything, he's sarcastic,
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.980]   he's saying, "Well, I mean, that's the way we would, if the resurrection didn't take
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.940]   place, we would live like everybody else.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.900]   Eat, drink, for tomorrow we die."
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.900]   There is no consequence.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.540]   In other words, what Paul is saying, "But that is not the case.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.820]   Jesus did rise from the dead.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.300]   The gospel is true.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.140]   As much as it is appointed for all men to die once, after this comes judgment."
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.540]   There's eternal consequences.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.940]   There's souls that are dying.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.220]   Christ came to save us from our sins.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.940]   That's what Paul is saying, "If that didn't happen and we don't believe that, let us eat,
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.620]   drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die."
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.380]   But that is not what we profess.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.140]   That is not what we believe.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.580]   That is not what we sing about every single Sunday.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:56.380]   In other words, Paul is saying, "Let us examine ourselves, that we do not simply drift."
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:00.880]   And that was a problem with the recipients of the letter of Hebrew.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.800]   They were apostate, or they were in danger of being apostate, simply because they were
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   drifting.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.920]   They were drifting.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.060]   Not only were they drifting, and he's warning them about this drifting, verse 8 he says,
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.220]   "We must not indulge in sexual immorality, as some of them did, and 23,000 fell in a
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.660]   single day."
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.580]   You know what's one of the first things that happens when we drift and our hearts become
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.580]   hardened?
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.780]   We become insensitive to sin.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.140]   We become insensitive to sin.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.060]   We can indulge in sin, and it's okay.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.140]   We justify, we can pretty much justify anything in our lives, when our hearts have become
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.620]   hardened toward God.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.380]   So he said, "Well, they just said, 'Let's eat, drink, be merry, and just kind of go play.'"
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.540]   Their hearts are hardened, and then they began to indulge in sexual immorality, and they
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.540]   became desensitized.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   You know, I became a Christian in the early 80s, and then now, obviously, 2017, and many
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.720]   years have passed.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.660]   And what was acceptable 30 years ago, or 30-some years ago, is night and day today.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.660]   I think people will be shocked.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:11.540]   And I'm not going to make a judgment statement, because every generation has their own sins.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.860]   You know?
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:19.500]   But I can tell you, and you can disagree with me, but I think most guys that I know who
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:28.420]   are Christians with me in college, or younger, will universally testify that our generation
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:37.140]   has become so desensitized to immorality, that even within the church, it's openly shared.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.940]   See, first it starts with, "Hey, let's just have fun.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.220]   Let's just live."
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.220]   And then we become desensitized toward sin.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.420]   Thirdly, it says, "We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.420]   destroyed."
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   They were persistent.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:59.900]   And as a result of their persistent sin, they tested God, and as a result, judgment came.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.700]   And then it says, in verse 10, "And they also grumbled, as some of them did, and were destroyed
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.260]   by the destroyer."
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.660]   See when you're not right with God, and if you're separated from the author of life,
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.500]   and you become desensitized to sin, and you persist in the sin, judgment comes upon you,
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.680]   and as a result of trials and difficulties that sometimes we don't even recognize as
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.500]   God's discipline upon our lives, then we start to grumble.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.580]   See worship is an expression of thanksgiving.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.340]   True worship is always an expression of thanksgiving toward what God has done.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.340]   But when you're under the pressure of God, you begin to grumble, not recognizing that
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.940]   His hand might be upon you, and they begin to grumble.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:49.060]   And so the opposite of worship is grumbling.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.860]   That's why the scripture says, "Do nothing out of grumbling or complaining."
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.680]   Because that is exactly the opposite of worship.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.540]   You won the lottery, the Son of God died for you, and then you're complaining about something,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.540]   something trivial.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.860]   So He said the Israelites were filled with grumbling, because there are certain things
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.900]   in their life just wasn't going right.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:14.060]   And then verse 12 is, "Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.060]   fall."
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:20.540]   Considering all these things that the Israelites fell into, He said, "Take a step back and
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.020]   take heed, take close examination."
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:26.100]   Are any of these things true of you?
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.340]   Is any of these things true of you?
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:34.580]   He said, "Take a step back and examine and humble ourselves before the Lord.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.340]   As they fell, you will also fall."
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.580]   And then verse 13, He says, "There is no temptation that has taken you that is not coming to all
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.580]   man."
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.380]   Now, that's a warning and an encouragement at the same time.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.000]   It's a warning because no matter how strong you think you are, no matter how clever you
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.460]   think you are, there is no temptation that sees you that is not taking all man down.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.980]   So even the greatest of men have fallen because of their pride.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:08.300]   But it's also an encouragement that even among the weakest of us, the temptations are the
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   same.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.580]   And He follows that up by saying, "God is faithful and He will not let you be tempted
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.300]   beyond your ability.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.420]   But with temptation He will also provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.980]   it."
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:25.000]   He starts by warning us.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.620]   The nation of Israel fell into the same thing, same apathy.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:34.820]   How can a nation who was so privileged, yet the Messiah come and standing right before
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:42.380]   them and did not recognize Him and ended up crucifying Him, He said, "Take heed."
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.840]   None of us are exempt from the same mistake.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.280]   If we follow the same pattern, nation of Israel, our hearts become hardened the same.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.660]   We become desensitized to sin.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.100]   We test the patience of our God.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.800]   And then we begin to grumble as a result.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.480]   And in our grumbling, we don't recognize God's hand.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.680]   But take heed.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.680]   Take heed.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:12.920]   I'm going to finish up with the same question I asked.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.400]   How could they have missed the Messiah?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.160]   Before we flippantly dismiss them as, "Oh, the nation of Israel, those guys were so blind."
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.720]   You know?
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.360]   How can they see somebody be resurrected?
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:32.080]   How can they see Him raise somebody from the dead, Lazarus, walking on water, feeding them
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   miraculously?
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.360]   "Oh man, if I saw that, that would not happen to me."
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.280]   Remember when Thomas saw Jesus and he said, "Let me see."
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.040]   And Jesus shows him His scars.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.960]   He said, "Thomas, you believe because you saw.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.240]   Blessed are those who do not see, and yet they believe."
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:54.080]   You and I can easily think and say, "Well, if I was there, I don't think that would have
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   done that."
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:03.560]   It's like, if Jesus came, would you recognize Him?
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.200]   If Jesus came tomorrow, would you recognize Him?
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.400]   I know we may be all asking the same question, and I hope that you don't just flippantly
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   answer that question, but we don't need to wait next month or next year to find that
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   out.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   Because the scripture says to the disciples, to all of us, He says, "I will not leave you
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.040]   as orphans."
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.640]   When He sent His disciples out, He said, "Go make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.760]   them in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:43.520]   that I have commanded you, and lo, behold, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.960]   He said He will be with us.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.080]   We don't have to wait.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.920]   We don't have to wait to see, will we recognize Him?
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   Will we follow Him?
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   Will we worship Him?
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.440]   Will we honor and obey Him?
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.200]   We don't have to wait until He comes again, because He said He is among us.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.120]   He's here in His Word.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.720]   He's here in the church.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.680]   He's here in the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.440]   He's here in the fellowship.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.480]   He's the light.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.280]   Do you recognize Him?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.360]   Do you worship Him?
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.120]   Or have we become blind?
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:31.960]   My prayer, again, for our church, and I know moving to a new building, and there's a lot
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.320]   of superficial excitement and all that, and I hope you are excited.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.200]   I am excited.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:46.560]   But every blessing that God gives us can turn into tragedy if that causes us to think that
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.080]   we're good.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.720]   We're good.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.080]   I'm fed.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.220]   I'm satisfied.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:59.920]   And I superficially follow Him, superficially worship Him, but it erases the desperateness
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.080]   in our heart that I need Christ.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.380]   I needed Him 34 years ago.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.280]   I needed Him 10 years ago.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.400]   I needed Him today.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.880]   And until we recognize just how desperate we are, no matter how physically wealthy we
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:25.440]   think we are, take heed lest we fall.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.000]   I pray that the example of the nation of Israel would convict our hearts to remind us of our
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.600]   desperateness before Christ.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.680]   Let's take some time to pray as we invite our worship team comes up.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.960]   And again, I want to encourage you, those of you who have a hard time praying in private,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:51.000]   I think the best way to learn how to pray in private is to learn to pray in public.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.120]   The same muscles that help you to pray in public will also help you to pray in private.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.000]   So I want to encourage you to wrestle.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.760]   And sometimes it's easier when we're praying together in a group.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   So pray.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.640]   To come before the Lord, you don't know what to say, say it.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   Say that to God.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   I don't know what to say, Lord.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.320]   I don't know how to pray.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.240]   Here's where I am.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.800]   Help me.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:19.240]   So let's come before the Lord in simple honesty.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.080]   I want to worship you.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.800]   Open my eyes, soften my heart that your word would have its effect on me.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.120]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
