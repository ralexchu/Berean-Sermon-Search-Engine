[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Good evening, Church family.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.000]   Hope you had a good week of rest.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   Tonight we're going to be continuing our study of Ephesians.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.760]   And we're going to go through chapter 5 and 6 in this series.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.760]   This is the second half.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.740]   Tonight we're going to be tackling the first paragraph of chapter 5.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.800]   Let's take a moment to go before the Lord as we engage the scriptures.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.760]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.720]   And God, we thank you over and over again that you are teaching us through your scripture.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.800]   God, we recognize that these truths you give to us are not things that we figure out on
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800]   our own.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.520]   Our Father God, these are revealed to us by your grace and mercies.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.080]   And you show us things, Father God, in the spiritual realities, things that, Father God,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.120]   many people do not understand.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.420]   And I pray that with gratitude and sincere appreciation, we would long for and we would
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640]   desire all the more to heed your commands, to listen to, Father God, your wisdom, and
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880]   all the more apply unto our lives.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.640]   We thank you so much for your grace and pray now that you would grant to us understanding
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640]   and conviction.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640]   Amen.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   Okay.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680]   Well, since we did take just a short break, it's good to review.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.520]   And so if you recall, chapters 1 through 3 of Ephesians was a lot of the theology and
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.240]   the groundwork of how God has blessed us and how in the gospel, God has elected.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.680]   He is the one who is effecting salvation.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.720]   And the contrast between what we were and who we are now was so evidently displayed
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.400]   in chapters 1 through 3.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.760]   And then in chapter 4 is here began the application for us.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.040]   Now here, oh, sorry.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.520]   Here in chapter 4 verses 1, it says, "I implore you," and I gave you some blanks just to test
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.920]   if you guys recall, "to blank in a blank blank."
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   Right?
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.000]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.180]   What is the command there?
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.640]   And the command was for us to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   been called.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   Okay?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.040]   Now, within the beginning portions of chapter 4, there was a huge challenge for us to seek
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   unity.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.900]   And there had to be this unity.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.120]   So he says that we have to have humility, gentleness, patience, showing tolerance for
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.800]   one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.880]   So we talked a lot about that.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.960]   And then in the middle of chapter 4, Apostle Paul says, "So this I say and affirm together
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.920]   with the Lord, that you no longer walk just as the blank."
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   What's the blank here?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.640]   It starts with the G. The word is Gentiles.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.720]   He talks about how the, within this passage, he talks about how the Gentiles walk in the
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.000]   futility of their mind, in ignorance, right?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.400]   In the callousness of their heart.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.120]   And then he goes on in verse 23 and says, "But that you be renewed in the spirit of
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.240]   your mind and put on the blank blank."
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.640]   That blank blank is a new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.160]   and holiness of the truth.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.940]   So we are challenged.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.960]   These commands are really again, broad pictures of what we're supposed to be doing.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   We're supposed to be regularly putting a sign, the kind of ignorance, the kind of stubborn
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.440]   callousness that we have, and to be regularly putting on the likeness of God, right?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.160]   That is something that we're regularly engaged with.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.240]   And so one of the challenges that I gave in the previous study was that we as believers,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.480]   we are always changing in that we're always maturing.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.660]   And the scripture's admonition to us was that we're supposed to be changing in every aspect
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.660]   unto Christ.
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.660]   Okay?
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.960]   Every aspect unto Christ.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.140]   So we're going to be ever growing.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.100]   Tonight there's a continuation of the application.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.980]   The application that we are supposed to be seeing the ramifications of the gospel applied
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.500]   into our lives.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.580]   And for that, we go to this passage, chapter five, verse one through six, which says, "Therefore
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.060]   be imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love just as Christ also loved you
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.980]   and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.100]   But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as is proper among
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.460]   saints.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.660]   And there must be no filthiness and silly talk or coarse jesting, which are not fitting,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.660]   but rather giving of thanks.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.620]   For this you know with certainty that no immoral or impure person or covetous man who is an
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.040]   idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.700]   Let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things, the wrath of God
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   comes upon the sons of disobedience."
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.140]   Okay?
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.300]   Now this passage, I think breaks down nicely into three sections and it's two verses each.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.700]   We're going to begin with the first section, which I like to call the commands.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.940]   So Paul clearly gives us two emphatic commands in this first portion of the passage.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.420]   Let's read it again and says, "Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children, and
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.220]   walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us, an offering and
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.340]   a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.840]   Okay?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.060]   When you look at that passage to be truthful, the commands aren't necessarily confusing.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.900]   Neither are they hard to incorporate.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.500]   They're pretty clear.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.420]   And I just want to give a tip of advice.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.780]   I know sometimes when you think about Bible study, if you're doing everything about outlining,
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.660]   observations, asking questions, then you do word studies.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.060]   And then you do X, Y, and Z, like the interpretation and then your own applications.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.700]   You don't have all the time in the world to do all of it.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.700]   Okay?
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.780]   So a lot of times what I do is I read the passage first, just run through and then start
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.620]   kind of deciding, is this a passage where I have to do a lot of word studies because
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.220]   there are unique words or words that aren't so commonly seen?
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.140]   What's more, other times like this when there's clear commands, what I like to do is actually
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.060]   take time to meditate.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.540]   I want to give you an example of that.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.020]   For example, if I'm just simply doing my devotions, I would take the first top two verses as opposed
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.540]   to all six, and then I would start asking immediately questions about what I understand
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.100]   about this.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.140]   For example, in an interpretive way, you would ask the question, "Therefore be imitators,"
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.060]   and you would ask, "What does it mean to imitate?"
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.540]   What's the Greek word for that or something like that?
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.980]   But another way you can do it by meditation is asking, "Is this the way I'm thinking
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.180]   about my life circumstances?"
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.300]   A lot of times when we look at a life circumstance, let's say difficulty, stress, or hardship,
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.980]   I'm more so asking the question, "How do I get out?"
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.220]   Am I asking the question, "How do I be like God in this?
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.580]   How do I be godly?"
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.500]   What's more, as beloved children, meditate.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.580]   What difference does it make that I'm a child of God in this expectation to imitate God?
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.980]   What difference does it make?
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.980]   As opposed to saying, "Imitate God as a slave.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.500]   Imitate God as somebody who was once far and now close."
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.660]   What difference does that make for me?
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.780]   What's more, to walk in love.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.820]   I have to ask myself, in my current concept of God's expectation for me to be loving,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.100]   what is the picture?
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.740]   What is a specific example?
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.940]   What's more, I have to ask myself the question, "Am I walking in love according to all the
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.540]   stuff that I've learned in Ephesians, or is my normal pattern of life marked by fear?
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.940]   I'm walking in suspicion.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.540]   I'm walking in doubt.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.940]   Maybe I'm even walking in self-righteousness or even hatred."
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.980]   Another question, "Just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us, it's very
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   clear really quickly that Jesus is the example and the model."
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.980]   Yes.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.020]   But what is a case example of a specific application of this?
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.580]   Another one, "An offering and sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.340]   Meditate, how is God seeing my actions?
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.900]   If my actions follow Christ's model, how is he seeing me?"
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.300]   Those are all questions to be really reflected.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.540]   I'd recommend just journaling all that.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.540]   Okay?
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.300]   Now, for our purposes, we're going to tackle the main commandments and ask the question,
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   "What are they?"
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.500]   And the two of them I've already highlighted for you there.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.940]   Let's tackle the first about being imitators of God.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:27.180]   Now, in terms of the term, I'll identify that the Greek word is to essentially mimic.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.820]   And we are talking about, in the Greek, it's used sometimes of impersonating an individual.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.460]   So an actor who is not necessarily pretending, but behaving and mimicking another person.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.580]   So when you think about this, we have to ask the question, just simply, "Okay, I am supposed
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.900]   to actually reflect God in many different ways."
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.900]   And so by way of meditation, you should be thinking about, "Okay, if I am thinking about
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.580]   being like God, do I have the categories in my head, whether it be stressful moments or
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:06.100]   circumstances of my life, that I want to be walking according to his pattern?
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.060]   That I'm walking according to the things that I already understand and know about him, his
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.580]   character traits?"
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.020]   You see, to us, we believe that God is an incredibly consistent individual.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.500]   So consistent, he's predictable.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.580]   What do I mean?
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.660]   You guys recall Jonah.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.940]   Jonah knew that God was so predictable.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.460]   He said, "If I go into that city of the Ninevites and I preach judgment and they repent, I know
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.460]   what's going to happen.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.900]   I knew it," he said, "you're going to show mercy."
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.600]   In that way, do we know enough about the patterns of God and his character that I can also be
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.500]   consistent in that fashion?
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   I need to be like him in his pattern of faithfulness, his truthfulness, his love, and so on.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.540]   Now the emphatic commandment and expectation is there, but there's something also interesting
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.220]   to observe, which is, he says, "As beloved children."
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.000]   What is this?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.140]   As I looked at it, I observed that this is an incredible motivation for us to be imitators
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.220]   of God.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.860]   Now you could think of this and say, "No, our child relationship, that relationship
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.580]   is the foundation by which we imitate God."
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.140]   True, but when you think about what it is that children do, we realize it's an incredible
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.140]   motivation.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.700]   I want to show you a passage from 1 John 3 that talks so much about the connection between
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.820]   our relationship as children and then also then our mimicking God's character.
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.500]   So here, let me take a moment to read to us this passage.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.100]   "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet, oh sorry, not appeared as
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.940]   yet what we will be.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.580]   We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we see him, we will see him just
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.980]   as he is.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:53.260]   And everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.700]   Little children, make sure no one deceives you.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.640]   The one who practices righteousness is righteous just as he is righteous.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.740]   The one who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.800]   The Son of God appeared for this purpose to destroy the works of the devil.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.420]   No one who is born of God practices sin because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.940]   because he is born of God.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.700]   By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.140]   Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.680]   his brother.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.880]   For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.000]   another."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.020]   That there is an incredible motivation for you to have this mentality, "I need to be
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   like God."
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   Why?
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.240]   Because you're of him, you're his child.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.080]   The identity that you are his, you reflect him.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.280]   Essentially, it's like you look like him.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.920]   No, that's gotta be his son.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.920]   Look at it.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.520]   God has nose, God has ears, God has eyes.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.960]   Our reflection of God shows us who we are.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.800]   So with that thinking, I want you to just to think about the connections there.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.040]   What a privilege.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.680]   What a unique privilege to be called son of God.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.120]   So essentially, God has already established that foundation.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.840]   God has already given us that motivation, given us the entire context by which we're
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.080]   supposed to be then walking according to his pattern, to his model, to everything that
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.320]   he's shown us about himself.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.480]   And I just want to say that's something to us like a massive privilege.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:44.040]   For God to want us to be like him, to emulate him, that to us is a massive grace to us.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.520]   And we should have an attitude of thankfulness as we think about that.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.760]   But again, in way of meditation on that, is this the way you're thinking intentionally?
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.520]   Meaning when was the last time you were specifically in a scenario and you intentionally thought,
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.600]   you know what?
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.080]   I need to be more like God here.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.320]   I need to be more like my father.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.240]   And that's the challenge I want to give to you.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.800]   Again, within specific moments of stress, hardship, or difficulty, it is in our fleshly
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.320]   nature to say, how do I best escape this?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.280]   How do I eliminate the threat?
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.320]   That's just a typical rationale of somebody living in this world.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.560]   But for us who know the father, the passage in John tells us that we need to be thinking
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   differently.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.000]   What's more, the passage commands us to walk in love.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.200]   Essentially, a primary way by which we reflect God and show his character is by loving.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.220]   And so much so, remember the scriptures in 1 John teach us that if you're not loving,
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.080]   that means you probably haven't seen God.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.240]   You probably don't know God because he is love.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.280]   It goes hand in hand.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.080]   If we've seen him, if we've actually experienced him, then we would also then emulate.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.340]   But what's more, I want to challenge us by doing this.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:08.520]   In the book of Ephesians especially, we have seen so many aspects of God's love.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.080]   And if we're saying we're supposed to be walking in that, and we're supposed to be imitating
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.880]   that, do you recall, are you able to put a picture to the kind of love we're supposed
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.800]   to express?
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.720]   Really briefly, you don't have to write all these down.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.600]   Maybe even just jot down the things that I've bolded for you here.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.380]   Number one, remember that in chapter one, Apostle Paul said, "God has blessed you with
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.080]   every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.480]   He's lavished us.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.120]   But what's more, in chapter one, Apostle Paul taught us that God's love is so purposeful.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.720]   It's so intentional and it's so personal.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.280]   God is not just generally saying, "I pray for you all.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   I have good thoughts.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.520]   Sending my thoughts your way."
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.640]   His plan is so meticulous.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.520]   It's so intentional and wanting our good, and wanting us also to experience his glory.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.560]   And then it's tied with also his wisdom.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.620]   It's tied with his insight.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.240]   It's not just, "You know, I'm just going to give you, give you, give you, whether it hurts
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.320]   you or not, whether you get fat or whatever it may be.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.960]   I'm just going to shove it in your mouth."
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.320]   That's not what he's doing, is it?
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.240]   It's in accordance with all of his wisdom.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.000]   It's in accordance with all of his strength.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.920]   It's in accordance with all of his might.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.600]   What's more, chapter two taught us that although we were dead in our transgressions and sins,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.400]   he was so rich in his mercy.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.160]   The chapter two in Ephesians is so beautiful in how it contrasts.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.600]   There was such darkness and you walked accordance to this, but he was so rich in his mercy.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.960]   What's more, it says, "You were so far.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   You were so far.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   You had no hope.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   You had no God.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.080]   You were separated from the commonwealth of Israel, but he has brought you near."
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.760]   What's more, in chapter three, scripture says that he has shared his promise with us.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.560]   God has shared his inheritance.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.800]   It was a mystery, he says.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   And this mystery, people did not understand, but it's being revealed that we, the Gentiles,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.700]   get to be fellow heirs, fellow partakers of the promise.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.560]   That is so crazy.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.720]   What generosity of God's love.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.040]   What's more, chapter four says that we ought to be humble.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.840]   Our love should be unifying.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.380]   Scripture commands us that we are designed to be a household of God and our love for
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.660]   one another should pretty much draw us together in Christ.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.880]   And then chapter four ends by saying, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.360]   each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you."
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.960]   It is a forgiving kind of love.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.240]   Now within this passage, it shows us more.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:56.460]   It shows us more in the expectation set by Christ's model, which also is to us the motivation.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.080]   That this love that Christ showed to us is incredibly sacrificial.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.400]   Jesus has shed his blood.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.200]   Jesus sacrificed his life voluntarily.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:14.880]   See, I think in our day, we, you know, just by force of habit, use the love, use the term
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.360]   love very flippantly as things pertaining to the things that just make us happy.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:26.000]   And that's not bad because love has with it the thought of things that are satisfying,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   things that are so delightful.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.920]   And so the things that really bring joy to our heart, we say, "I love that."
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.900]   But the thing is, we say stuff like, "I love food.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.000]   I love material things.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I love to be here.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I love to be there."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.360]   And all of those things are not wicked and sinful because there is within things that
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.960]   we love, things that bring us pleasure.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:55.040]   But here, Christ's love transcends because his love leads him to bear cost, to bear a
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.900]   burden all for our benefit, all for our good.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:06.640]   And so within that, scripture says he is challenging us to do a kind of love that is sacrificial
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.960]   like his, which ultimately becomes an offering and a sacrifice to God as a flagrant Roma.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.340]   We're thinking about motivations here.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.400]   And one of the greatest motivations that we have for doing anything is that it pleases
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.560]   our Father.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.320]   It pleases our God.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.640]   Think about how illustrative and descriptive this is.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:33.440]   That when God sees us empowered by the sacrificial love of Christ, being strengthened to be able
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:39.280]   to love beyond reason, beyond just logistics and practicalities and to sacrifice things,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.360]   time, energy, money, whatever it may be, to love other people.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.480]   God sees that as a pleasant aroma.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.560]   Now I was thinking of like analogies for this, but I didn't know if it was appropriate because
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:01.760]   I'm trying to picture God being pleased by his children loving one another, loving others.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.320]   I can't use just the analogy that I thought was of like coffee.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.600]   Like when I smell coffee, it's just, even the smell wakes me up.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.680]   It doesn't do justice.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.280]   It doesn't compare.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.720]   Probably best way to think about it is when you're a parent and you see your siblings,
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.400]   what frustrates you is not, "Oh, you didn't do your chores."
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:29.160]   When the siblings fight, when brother and brother hurt each other, it's enraging.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.840]   How dare you?
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:37.080]   But when they are taking care of each other, when a child is trying to actually help the
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.400]   other person, maybe even say, "Oh, here, you take this first," right?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.160]   You just, it brings you joy.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.760]   It doesn't necessarily do anything for you.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.600]   You're not like receiving the benefit of that, but it just brings you joy.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   That's our father.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.520]   A father seeing the children love one another.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.880]   All right.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.820]   We spent some extra time on that and let's move to point number two.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.720]   Point number two, if the first two verses was the command, the next two verses, verses
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.480]   three and four is the rationale, right?
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.720]   And what he tells us is you need to behave that way because that's appropriate for you.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.320]   But the other things of the world, immorality, impurity, and greed, these, it is absolutely
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   inappropriate.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.600]   And so I've entitled it, "It Doesn't Fit At All."
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.720]   What he says is, "But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.080]   as is proper among saints.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.800]   There must be no filthiness and silly talk or coarse jesting, which are not fitting,
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.320]   but rather giving of thanks."
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.080]   What I'd like to highlight for you by way of observation first is not the contents of
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.120]   the immoral stuff, but actually the strength of the prohibition.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.760]   What I mean by that is, look how emphatic this is.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.680]   He says, "Of these things, they must not even be named among you."
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   That's really strong, as is proper among saints.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.520]   So essentially saying this is not proper for the saints.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.000]   He says, "There must be no filthiness and silly talk or coarse jesting, which is not
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   fitting."
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It doesn't fit.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.320]   I like the way NIV says, it says, "But among you, there must not even be a hint of sexual
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   immorality."
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   Right?
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.640]   "Your name and this stuff shouldn't even be in the same sentence.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.280]   It shouldn't be mentioned among you guys," essentially what it's saying.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:33.240]   And so when we look at this strong exhortation, the strong commandment, we have to appreciate
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.680]   this extreme measure, so to speak.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.000]   Because within our framework of mind, we have a gauge.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.520]   Every single one of us exercises a kind of bar, a standard.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.000]   And I'm going to ask you this question.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.320]   Have you adopted this measure or have you set the bar wherever you're comfortable?
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.240]   What is your comfortable, like a, sorry, what to do, what degree are you comfortable with
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.920]   this stuff is the question, right?
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.400]   What am I saying?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.760]   I think in this generation, people definitely, I mean, this is my opinion, but I think most
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:16.800]   of you guys will probably agree with me that in this generation, we live in a very permissive,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.000]   excuse-oriented generation.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.640]   And given that, the bar in terms of what is appropriate, what is fitting, constantly moves.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.040]   And if you talk to anybody in the previous generation, they're like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.360]   we would have never even done that.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.600]   We would never even, that would have, people would have been ashamed of that kind of stuff,"
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.600]   right?
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   There's talks like that.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.200]   And the thing about it is, in this generation, not only are we like that, but we're defensive
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   and we're sensitive.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.360]   If someone says, "Hey, that's not right," it's like, "Who are you to tell me what's
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   not right?"
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.280]   "Hey, that's inappropriate," like, "Inappropriate?
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   What do you mean inappropriate?
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.040]   That sounds like," and then they get all defensive like that.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.160]   But for us, we have to make sure we're not setting the bar by what you're comfortable
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.480]   with because we believe in God.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.320]   Our Father sets what we should be comfortable with.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.040]   And what he says here is a measure that says it should be way over here.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.560]   There must not even be a hint of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity in you.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.680]   Have you adopted that?
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:25.400]   Now, this being said, I want to move to thinking about this with the categories that he says,
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.280]   that there should be no immorality, impurity, or greed.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.760]   There shouldn't be any filthiness, silly talk, or coarse chesting.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.240]   If you even take a moment to think about these two categories, and these two categories I
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.680]   asked for DC themes, and yes, there is.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.920]   Immorality, impurity, and greed, essentially it is talking about that kind of lustfulness,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.160]   passions, maybe sexual pleasures.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.120]   And so essentially what you have is this self-oriented input.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.840]   And then with filthiness, silly talk, and coarse chesting, you have output, the stuff
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.880]   that comes out of your mouth.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.980]   Both ways it should be pure, right?
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   It should be pure.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.400]   But we are talking about the degree of purity, and I'm emphasizing that more because I want
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.680]   you to think about this.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.200]   To what degree and measure did Christ expect when he was teaching the disciples about our
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.880]   purity?
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.760]   He says, when you even look at that woman, and you sit in your heart, you have an adulterous
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.200]   heart, right?
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.280]   He wanted purity even right up here.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.400]   He wanted purity even in the fantasy lands of our mind.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.880]   He wanted purity even of our speech.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.120]   He said, if you call your brother a fool, you're going to be condemned.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.200]   I want us to think about that.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.240]   Now because you guys have done your own study, I'm going to leave this to you to discuss
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.040]   to what degree we should be fighting these things.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.880]   How can we even raise our standards, especially personally for ourselves, to what measure
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.480]   are we striving now?
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.840]   So moving to the next part, section three.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.280]   I'm sorry, I should have edited that.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.780]   It should say point three versus five and six.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.480]   So if the first two verses was commands, the second two verses is going to be the rationale.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.220]   It doesn't fit at all.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.080]   And this last section is called the sobering reality, verses five and six.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.520]   Let me read for us what the sobering reality is.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   There it is.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   Okay.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.600]   He says, for this you know with certainty that no immoral or impure person or covetous
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.240]   man who is an adulterer has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.880]   Let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things, the wrath of God
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.200]   comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.400]   Okay.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.620]   So notice how he says for this, you should know with certainty, you should already know
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.280]   this stuff and you should already know this stuff.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.440]   Well, what should we know?
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:48.520]   Well, if we summarize those two sections, it can be summarized this way, which is first
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:54.840]   that immoral, the immoral person who practices immorality, impurity, and greed, that kind
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.300]   of selfishness will go to hell.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.860]   That is a massive category in our minds.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.420]   That's a massive gospel truth.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:08.740]   What's more, it says God's wrath is coming upon the disobedient, right?
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.400]   God's wrath is coming upon disobedient.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.300]   I want to share this with you guys that it is so important for us to have the proper
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:24.220]   worldview, not as how the rest of the world sees it, not as how some people, some pockets
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:31.820]   of individuals sees it, but as God is teaching you, this is how you should see this generation.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.700]   It's a perverse generation.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.640]   And this perverse generation without Christ is going to go to hell.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.720]   And as we think about that, I want you to realize that where you stand versus where
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.160]   a non-Christian stands, there is a massive line.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.000]   It's a huge gap.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.920]   That line is eternal.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.880]   Think about that.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.400]   So this should completely inform us in terms of how we react to things in life, how we
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.840]   see our decisions, and especially when we have the temptation to live according to the
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.600]   world, to think like the world, these truths should affect us.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.560]   We know that this world is going to experience the wrath of God.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.840]   What I realize is as I'm thinking about this, sometimes you have individuals who just, they
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.360]   love the world.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.480]   And they say like, you know, I just can't help myself.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.960]   I just keep looking at this stuff on the internet and I want it.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   I want to buy it.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.520]   I want to have it.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.080]   You know, now I can sit there and instruct them, what you got to do is turn off the TV.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.320]   What you got to do is turn off the internet.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.200]   But it's not so much the specific instructions.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.560]   They have to have a correction on the whole world view.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:51.640]   What you think is so lovely is going to be judged by the wrath of God.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.520]   Even now, right now, there's so much turmoil, people fighting each other.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.120]   Now there are so many things in terms of injustice that we should care about.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.640]   And of injustice, there are things that we have to take actions for.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.600]   However, when Christians start saying, you know what, I hope for a world, I hope for
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.200]   a generation.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.240]   I wonder if they're buying into a vision of the world that's ungodly.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:24.040]   Ungodly, not because it's like vile and sinful, but ungodly because it's so limited.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.920]   I want you to look at something here.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:32.440]   The world view that is wrong for the individual within this first sentence, the immoral and
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.800]   impure person or a covetous man, you know why his world view is wrong?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.040]   Because his God and his world view is wrong.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.200]   His God is an absolute fake.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.160]   It's an idol, right?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.240]   And typically when you practice idolatry, you're practicing an idolatry where you are
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.120]   at the center of the world.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.600]   Your world view needs to be radically shifted.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.000]   But what's more, take a look at this.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.120]   Let no one deceive you with empty words.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.760]   What are empty words?
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.000]   Let me tell you what are empty words.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   What are empty words?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.300]   Are words like, you got to do what makes you happy.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.040]   You know, something as innocent as YOLO.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.320]   Now, I'm not saying you could never say that.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   Say it.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   You know, like you only live once.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.960]   It's kind of a joke, right?
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.560]   But what is that motto used for?
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.320]   Motto is used for live it up.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.440]   YOLO is used for, I know this is stupid, but I'm just going to do it because you only live
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.880]   once, right?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.240]   Those are empty words.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   You know why?
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.760]   Because those words are rational when you live only this life.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.600]   And what Apostle Paul says, what King Solomon says is when your rationale is limited to
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.040]   this generation, it is fleeting, it is temporary, and therefore it is empty.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.600]   It's vain.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   It's weightless.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.640]   Our rationale has with it eternity.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.360]   We reason with Christ in mind, God with mind, eternity in mind, and heaven in mind.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.120]   We're not looking for better days here.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.880]   This world, God is not going to salvage and make better.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.000]   He says sin is going to get worse.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.840]   Sin is going to inspire more sin.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.480]   The love of most will grow cold.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.840]   It's going to get hostile.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.280]   You'll be persecuted and it's going to be difficult to live in this land.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.720]   And when it's ripe for judgment, God is going to bring this wrath and burn it.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.960]   Why are we talking like the rest of the world hoping just for better days here?
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.320]   We can't think like that.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.600]   We've got to be thinking more in line with the gospel truths.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.280]   We're not just waiting for new policies, new governors, and new presidents.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.840]   That's not where our hope is.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.040]   For us, we're eagerly anticipating the return of our King.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.760]   And so our rationale and our words are waiting.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.640]   This is the way that we need to respond.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:56.840]   So as we take a moment to think about these things, to me, these things are sober realities
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:03.440]   that not only dictate how we respond to current events and life situations, these things also
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.600]   dictate our specific momentary decisions.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   As I experience temptation, what should I be thinking?
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.040]   I should be first thinking I should be more like my God, my Father.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.080]   I should be thinking I should be living and walking in love and not in selfishness.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.320]   I should not have impurities, lusts, and greeds.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.520]   I should not have gross things coming out of my mouth, but rather I should be a pure
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:35.400]   light in this generation because I'm living with an unshakable hope in God.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.280]   That's the way my mind should work.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.040]   And so by way of conclusion, I want to say we have received some really broad exhortations
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.800]   and commandments today to imitate God and to walk in love.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.680]   But just remember, we have to make sure that we take these broad commandments that encapsulate
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.320]   everything that we're doing.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.600]   And you have to be the one that takes case examples and apply specifically.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.640]   How am I going to walk in love here?
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:08.040]   How am I going to show up into this scenario and exercise the kind of sacrificial, giving,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.800]   lavishing love that God exercises with me?
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.040]   This is to you the kind of intentional, purposeful living that we want to do before the Lord.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.760]   And that we know is going to be pleasing to God.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.480]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.400]   Lord God, we pray.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.880]   We pray for the people around us.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.600]   We want people to have hope in Christ, not to place hope in this world.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.840]   This world, Lord God, is ready for judgment.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.480]   This world, Lord God, you say is getting filled.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.880]   It's getting filled to the brim.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:53.480]   And I pray, Father God, that we would then now have even a greater urgency to be lights,
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.920]   placing our hope and our trust and our confidence in our God.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.640]   I do thank you so much, Lord, for your gospel truth that empowers us and shapes our thinking.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.600]   I do pray, Lord, that we would be all the more renewed.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:15.560]   And I also pray, God, for our church, that there would be such a sobriety then in realizing
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   that as we perhaps even are thinking more now about the end times.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.000]   It has been long and people have been waiting.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.320]   And Lord, we want to say, God, that we eagerly await your return.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.880]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.200]   Amen.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.700]   (fork clinks)
