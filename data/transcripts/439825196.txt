[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   I want you to turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 9.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.240]   This is a, this is not one of those passages that you can just read while you're falling
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.160]   asleep because you're going to fall asleep, right?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.840]   Just like if you read this passage, it's going to sound like we got a text straight out of
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.400]   the book of Leviticus because it is, right?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.280]   It describes the tabernacle, the holies, the holy of holies and the articles that's in
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.540]   there and why it's in there.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.160]   And so, you know, I think God did this on purpose in order to slow us down.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.080]   There's certain things that we do that requires us to be careful, right?
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.160]   If you are planning to get married and you're, you're kind of considering, is this the right
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.040]   person because you know the weight of this decision, right?
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.520]   This is not just something that you're going to do and then decide later.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.280]   It's like, oh, I made a mistake.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.000]   And this covenant is serious enough to where you will get counsel, you will seek advice,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.640]   you know, even when people get married, you know, like whenever I officiate weddings and
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.040]   when you have parties who haven't participated in weddings, they want to know everything
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.280]   like what's right, what's wrong, you know, do we light the candle, who goes out first,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.040]   who sits, who stands up, you know, is this okay, is this not okay?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.220]   Because there is a weight to what they are doing.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.320]   They want to make sure that they get it right, right?
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.240]   The Bible talks about the creation in two chapters, as significant, as important as
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.560]   it is, it's only recorded in two chapters in the book of Genesis.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.160]   There are over 50 chapters that talk about the details of the tabernacle.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.640]   And it's not easy reading.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.920]   It's not something that you can just skim through.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.880]   There's details about who should handle it, how long it should be, who can give sacrifice,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   who can't give sacrifice, they even have the details of what kind of clothes to wear while
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.640]   they're doing the sacrifice, what kind of clothes to wear when they go out to bury certain
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.800]   things.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.680]   And it's tedious to the point where we can be easily tempted to just kind of flip through
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.840]   and say, oh, the tabernacle is about Jesus and then that's it.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.320]   But there's a reason behind why God does that.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   We are meant to slow down, right?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.040]   We are meant to slow down and ask questions.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.120]   Why is this here?
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000]   What is the significance behind this?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.720]   Why is there 50 chapters of this in the Bible?
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.600]   Same thing with whenever you see genealogies, our natural tendency is like, I don't recognize
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.360]   any of these people, maybe two or three.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.400]   I don't know who these people are.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.600]   There's reason why the genealogy is there.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.920]   God didn't just put it there.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.440]   It's like, you know, you guys, you guys did the hard work.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.600]   So genealogy, go to sleep.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.640]   And then you wake up at the other end.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.800]   There's a reason why it's there and it is significant.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.440]   So the tabernacle isn't just here, just willy nilly.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   It's here for a reason.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.840]   So the text that we're looking at in chapter chapter nine gives us the detailed information.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.480]   Again, this was not the text that I would have wanted to preach out in the sun, you
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.300]   know, not knowing if we're going to be able to have a tent that works and it still may
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300]   not work.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   Right.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.400]   So because this is this is one of those things that really requires your attention.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200]   So I know it may be a little bit hotter than normal, but I'm asking you guys to do your
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.900]   best to pay attention because because it is important.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   So I'm not going to read the text.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.880]   I'm just going to pray and then just jump in this morning.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.240]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   We know all that is going on around us.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.720]   We pray, Father, for soberness and power and authority that only you can give.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   We ask, Lord God, that you have been revival during our generation, that we would not drift,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   but be anchored in Christ.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.000]   May your word have its effect on us this morning.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.560]   Amen.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.220]   Especially now, right, we've been talking about being anchored in Christ, but especially
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.160]   now there is a dire need for the church to be anchored in Christ.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.320]   If you if you haven't been watching the news, you may not be aware, but China just recently,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.600]   just a few days ago, passed a law saying it is mandated that every church who worships
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.240]   the Communist Party above Jesus, and it is required now by law.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.000]   They've been headed that direction for a while, but now they've made it official.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.760]   So among the among the missionaries who've been in there, they've been slowly kicking
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   them out.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.040]   But now all the people who've been out temporarily thinking that maybe the door will open, go
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   back in.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.880]   Now it's uncertain because of of how hard the Chinese government has come, whether they
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.640]   will be able to go back in.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.120]   But this is not just happening in China.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.140]   This is a worldwide phenomenon that all the years that I've been a Christian, I've never
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.880]   seen persecution at this level, where usually it was it was localized, whether it was in
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.120]   the Middle East or India or China or North Korea.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.720]   If you watch the news, this is happening all over the world and even here in the United
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   States.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.440]   Again, that's why I ask you to pay very close attention to what's happening, what's happening
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.240]   in the government, because there are there are slowly things that are slowly being passed
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.980]   in our government that is specifically targeting conservative Christianity, which is us.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.280]   So when I say conservative Christian, we're talking about Bible believing Christians who
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.760]   believe in the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ, who believe that Christ is going to
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.880]   come and redeem his church.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.200]   And so we believe in the Bible.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.860]   We preach the Bible and we practice the Bible.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.020]   And so if you are a Bible believing believer at a Bible believing church, there are slowly
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.240]   laws being passed that are being specifically targeted toward us, not just our church, but
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.920]   everyone who falls under the category that we talked about.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.100]   We knew it was coming.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.960]   We didn't know it was going to be a year or 10 years or maybe next generation.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.480]   But we're not that far away.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   It could be months.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   It could be years.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.000]   But we see it coming.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.700]   And the Bible tells us in Matthew 24 at the end times, he says, because of the increase
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.100]   of wickedness, love of many will grow cold.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.040]   You notice here that he doesn't say that because of increased wickedness that churches are
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.280]   going to get into fights and divide and heresy is going to come in.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.560]   All of that may be true.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.600]   But basically, the way that the church dies is not with a fight.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.440]   There's no clear line that says this is when the church closed.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   Usually when the church is closed, it dies because of erosion, because people are not
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   paying attention.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   They're not anchored in Christ.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.960]   And as soon as the waves come, people just begin to drift.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.220]   And they're OK with drifting because their heart has already left Christ a long time
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.960]   ago before they ever physically left the church.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:01.080]   And so any boat that is not anchored, especially now, the current is going to take you away
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.540]   from God.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.100]   And that is what we're seeing right now.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.040]   God is pruning the church.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.960]   And if we've been attending church, if we've been kind of casually allowing our lives to
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.680]   drift toward Christ because of the friendships that we've had, because of the community that
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.000]   we belong to, encouragement of our brothers and sisters, eventually that will erode and
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.080]   will not be enough.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.040]   And I believe that that time has come.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.520]   That lukewarm Christians will no longer be Christians.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.680]   That lukewarm Christians will eventually fade away.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.760]   They will not make a decision.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.800]   There's no line being drawn saying that if you cross this line, you are a follower of
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.880]   Christ and if you don't, you won't be.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.160]   It will just gradually drift and nominal Christians will eventually leave the church, never to
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.780]   return.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.800]   And so I believe that we are in the beginning of that right now.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.320]   And so all the more why there is an urgency for us to pay attention.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.280]   There's an urgency for us to examine.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.880]   Yes, the tabernacle.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.960]   We need to pay close attention to the tabernacle because of the meaning behind what it says.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.200]   The reason why the tabernacle is mentioned so much in the scripture is because the tabernacle
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.800]   was at the center of the Israelite community to constantly remind them of who they are
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.600]   and who God is.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:23.160]   In order for them to be able to know when Christ came that the true Redeemer has come.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   The tabernacle was not a side project that God had.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.200]   There's a reason why God put the tabernacle right in the center of the Israelite community.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.920]   Every tribe was at equal distance to this tabernacle.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.240]   The sacrifices, right?
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.400]   The smoke that they smelled.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.520]   The slaughtering of the animals, the cry of sheep as they're being slaughtered was something
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.480]   that the whole Israelite community heard night and day.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.880]   So Israelites did not need it to be to be reminded of the tabernacle because of the
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.200]   very presence of the tabernacle caused them to be sober.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.760]   What we want to do today is as we look in at chapter nine, the author has been warning
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.240]   and encouraging and challenging and rebuking the church not to drift away from Christ.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.360]   And the central message that he's been trying to get to is that Christ is above all of these
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.600]   things and where this is the most dominant, where it is the clearest taught is at the
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   tabernacle.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.360]   Where the need for Christ, the supremacy of Christ is clearly taught is at the tabernacle.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.520]   That's why he takes all of his argument of the supremacy of Christ, brings us to chapter
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   seven, Jesus Christ in the order of Melchizedek, the king priest, king of righteousness, king
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.160]   of priests.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.040]   And then he's going to take us into this new covenant and specifically at this tabernacle,
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.240]   the old covenant and how it prepares us for the for the new covenant in Christ.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   So in what he says here, there's three things that I want to I want to point out that he
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.560]   points out.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   What did the tabernacle teach the nation of Israel?
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.300]   First thing that we see is in verse six and seven.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.020]   Now when these things have been so prepared, meaning the tabernacle, the priests are continually
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.760]   entering the outer tabernacle, performing the divine worship.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.520]   But into the second, only the high priest enters once a year.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   The first thing that it teaches is the utter helplessness of a sinful man.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.280]   The utter helplessness of the sinful man.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.320]   When he says here that the priests were entering to perform worship continually, the word for
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.280]   worship here is literal, which basically is referring to not just a gathering of people,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.800]   you know, singing songs like what we are doing.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.480]   The word literal here is talking about the activity of the priests.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.640]   The primary activity of the priest was to slaughter the animals in order to reconcile
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.040]   holy God to sinful people.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   But in saying that the priest had to do this continually over and over and over again,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.560]   meaning that whatever sacrifice that was given, whatever worship was given, it could never
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.480]   satisfy this holy God.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.440]   And so even if you gave it a hundred times, you wake up the next day in need of another
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   atonement.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:24.040]   That's what he means, that they had to do this continually over and over and over again.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.120]   Imagine how many animals were sacrificed because of this.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.040]   For every sin that you are aware of, you are to take an animal without blemish and take
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.960]   it into the tabernacle to be slaughtered.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.480]   This tabernacle, the size of this tabernacle would have been a whole lot bigger than this
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.880]   tent right here.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   It would have been maybe about this wide and that long.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.680]   It would not have been much bigger than this.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.120]   This tabernacle where the sacrifices were taking place served over a million people's
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.440]   sins.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.280]   A million people.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.440]   So can you imagine the line every morning that that priest woke up, the people waiting
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.720]   to slaughter the animal asking for forgiveness.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.520]   And he said this had to be done week after week, month after month, year after year.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.000]   If your daily sacrifices were not enough, the day of atonement was basically like spring
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.240]   cleaning that even if you cleaned your house every single week, there will be dust and
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.440]   filth that would accumulate in the house where you would require another major cleaning where
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.680]   everybody gets together just for the purpose of cleansing.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   That was the day of atonement.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:45.920]   So when he says that the priest had to enter this tabernacle to give these sacrifices continually,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   it means that no matter how many animals were sacrificed for our sins, it would have never
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.720]   satisfied the Holy God.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   So the first thing that the tabernacle taught was the utter helplessness of the sinner before
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.680]   a Holy God.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:06.120]   In fact, during the day of atonement, during the time of Christ, a secular Jewish historian
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:12.040]   writes that there was so much blood shed during that day that some of the priests in certain
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.860]   parts of the temple were over knee deep in the animal's blood.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:23.780]   Some calculate as many as 1.2 million animals being sacrificed at the day of atonement on
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.780]   one day.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:31.140]   In fact, the sacrifice was so tremendous that the Jewish economy in Jerusalem was largely
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.380]   dependent upon these sacrifices.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.100]   And this is the reason why we see the scene at the temple where people are doing business
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.200]   because that was their primary economy because so many animals were being sacrificed day
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.080]   after day, especially on the day of atonement.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:51.700]   So when the author here says that at the tabernacle, these priests had to enter and worship continually
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:14:00.420]   over and over and over, it was to teach the inefficiency and inability of these sacrifices
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.880]   to bring us to Christ.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   The sacrifice was given by the priest himself who needed sacrifice.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.180]   He needed to sacrifice over and over and over again.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.260]   And then he needed to give sacrifice for the nation of Israel.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:22.520]   He said for sins that they committed in ignorance in verse 7.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.660]   Now in our generation, whenever we say, you know, we committed sin in ignorance, we automatically
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.420]   think that's not a big sin.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.940]   How can I, how can it be a sin if I didn't know about it?
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.460]   You know, we, we think that if we calculate and if we willfully acted, then that's a sin.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.420]   But if I didn't know about it, how can that be sin?
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:48.180]   Why would God require us to make sacrifices for sins committed when we didn't know?
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:54.000]   See it's the very definition of sin means to miss the mark.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.900]   You don't need to be willfully doing something to miss the mark.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.160]   You just need to miss the mark.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   You don't even have to know that there is a mark to hit.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.980]   But as long as we don't hit the mark, we have sin.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.480]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.280]   Now you know what that teaches?
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.460]   Some people may say, well, that's not fair.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.880]   If I wasn't aware of it, how can he require a, an atonement for that?
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.940]   What that teaches us is that our very core of who we are is in rebellion against God.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.940]   So the sin is not simply something that we just do.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.860]   We're not sinners because we sin.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.360]   We sin because we are sinners.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.540]   We are unable not to sin.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.600]   That's what the, that's what that is teaching us.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.420]   So even the sins that are committed in ignorance needed atonement.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.820]   That's how deeply the sin affects, affects the sinner.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:46.540]   So that tabernacle, the sacrifice that needed to be given continually, first and foremost,
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.500]   taught the sinners the utter helplessness before this Holy God.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.100]   And that's what they were reminded over and over again, that no matter how much you eat,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.060]   maybe today after service, you're going to go grab a great buffet and you're going to
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.820]   eat a meal of five normal people.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.100]   Well, tomorrow morning, you're going to wake up, you're going to be hungry.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.180]   And you may do that buffet over and over again, but the next day you're going to wake up,
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.820]   you're going to be hungry again.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.420]   A sinful flesh has the same appetite.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.640]   No matter how much we confess, as long as we are in this flesh, you and I are not able
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.220]   to work it off.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.860]   And that's what the tabernacle taught, that this physical sacrifice was not going to change
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.580]   anything about who we are inwardly, our utter helplessness.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:37.980]   Secondly, the tabernacle taught that the entrance to God was closed.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:44.180]   See the passage in verses two to five in verse eight describes the intricate details of what
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.620]   was in the outer room versus the inner room.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.940]   They call it the holy and then the holy of holies.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.460]   The holy of holies and the holy room was separated by this curtain.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.980]   I think the best way for us to understand this is if somebody invites you to the house,
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.740]   you know, obviously they want friendship, they want some sort of fellowship with you.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.780]   But when they invite you to the house, they're not inviting you to their bedroom.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.100]   You don't go say, you know what, you know, somebody asked me to their house and they
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.540]   say, I went into their house, I walked into their bedroom, opened their closet and then
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.460]   opened their drawer and I examined all these things because they asked me to come to their
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.460]   house.
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.460]   Of course not.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.740]   When you go to somebody's house, you go to their living room until you are, for whatever
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.420]   the reason, you have to be invited to the inner room.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.100]   You can't just enter in.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:35.940]   I think the best way for us to describe this is in God's house where he came to meet mankind,
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.620]   the holy of holies was the master bedroom, which was permanently closed.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.780]   He allowed sinners represented by the priest to come into the outer part, the living room
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:54.060]   of the tabernacle where they had certain elements that remind them that they needed God to sustain
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:00.260]   them, but the actual presence of God was not open to the sinners.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:08.220]   In fact, that room was so mysterious that even the holiest of men, the high priest,
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.060]   after sacrificing for his own sins, would go there for a brief period of time with the
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.740]   bell on him, with the rope tied and would do his business and come right out.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.240]   So even he was not a guest that can linger.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.620]   There was no seat for him to rest.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.220]   There was no place for him to casually stand.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.420]   He was sprinkled with blood representing the cleansing of the sins of the nations, which
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.740]   he would have to do again and again and again and again.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.400]   The entrance was closed to him, and that's exactly what the tabernacle taught.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:46.920]   Not only was there an utter helplessness of mankind, that because of this helplessness,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:53.000]   the gap between God, the holy God, and a sinful man was something that they could not bridge
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.820]   by human work.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.640]   That's what the tabernacle taught day in and day out.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:07.280]   Third and finally, the tabernacle taught that the sacrifices given was unable to cleanse
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.240]   us of our sins.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.060]   It says in verse 9, "According to both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.400]   the worshiper perfect in conscience."
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.820]   You know, this is an interesting word here, the word conscience.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.520]   The definition of the word conscience means this.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:32.560]   It denotes either personal intuition, a knowledge of something, or more specifically, the moral
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.200]   awareness of good or evil.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.380]   Did you catch that?
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.640]   I know it's a little bit hot, but did you catch that?
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.800]   Where did you hear that before?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:51.360]   The definition of the word conscience is a self-awareness of the knowledge of good and
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.880]   evil.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.000]   Where did you hear that before?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.880]   In Genesis.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.480]   In Genesis, where God told Adam and Eve that you can eat of any tree but of the tree of
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.840]   knowledge of good and evil.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.800]   Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is a definition of conscience, you shall
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.160]   not eat for in the day that you eat from it, you will surely die.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.880]   In other words, the tabernacle taught the nation of Israel that it is unable to reverse
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.160]   the curse of mankind.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.560]   That no matter how many sacrifices were given, no matter how many outward activity, no matter
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.960]   how many times we gathered together, no matter how much money that you give to the church,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.880]   no matter how many righteous acts that we participate in, it is unable to reverse the
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.560]   curse because our conscience has been tainted.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:54.000]   So a sinful man in whatever he does eventually will become sinful.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.920]   In fact, the interesting passage in Haggai chapter 2, 13 to 14, Haggai writes to the
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.520]   nation of Israel during a period when they were very busy in the temple.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.060]   They were very busy in the religious activity.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:14.120]   But Haggai is sent to warn them that their religious activity does nothing to erase their
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.440]   sins.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.120]   It doesn't bring them any closer to God.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:25.000]   That you cannot negate your sinful activity by having some good activity.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.160]   Most religions today and sadly many Christians subconsciously believe that if my good things
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.060]   outweigh the bad things, even though we may not express it in doctrine, subconsciously
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.120]   we think that if we've done good enough, that somehow that wins some kind of favor before
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.120]   God.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.560]   If we've done good enough, somehow we don't deserve to be in the church and we tend to
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.080]   drift away from the church when we are in sin.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.300]   Well that was the attitude of the Israelites during the time of Haggai.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.000]   But listen to what Haggai says.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.880]   Haggai chapter 2, 13 and 14, then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean from a corpse touches
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.320]   any of these, will the latter become unclean?"
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.640]   Do you understand the question?
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.600]   Because in the book of Leviticus, if an individual who is considered unclean because of some
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.920]   sort of defect in his life, because of some sort of disease, maybe he was a leper, because
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.760]   he was considered unclean, if that unclean man touches a sacrifice that was set apart
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.840]   to be dedicated to God, does that animal, does he become clean or does the animal become
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.000]   unclean?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   That's the question.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Okay.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.220]   But what is the answer?
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.960]   The animal becomes unclean.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:50.360]   Because the unclean man touched what was clean, the unclean man doesn't become clean because
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.480]   of that animal.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.600]   Now this is extremely important because this is the whole point that he's trying to get
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.720]   at.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.120]   The religious activity of an unclean man does not make him clean.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.120]   It makes the religious activity unclean.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   That's what he means.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   Does it make it clean?
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.240]   The priest answered, "It will become unclean."
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.560]   Then Haggai said, "So is this people and so is this nation before me," declares the
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.840]   Lord, "and so is every work of their hands and what they offer there is unclean."
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:30.640]   Until a man is regenerated and he is cleansed by the blood of Christ, even the religious
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.400]   activity that he participates in, they become unclean.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.240]   Spirit becomes unclean.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.120]   Giving becomes unclean.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.360]   Even missions become unclean.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.320]   Building churches, planting churches, even the preaching becomes unclean.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:57.800]   Because an unclean man will pursue unclean end goals thinking that as long as he is doing
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.880]   what is clean.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.840]   Do you understand the difference?
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.300]   And that is a deception of people who've been in the church for a long period of time.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.600]   Because we engage in religious activity.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.120]   We engage in Christian activity that if we engage enough that we subconsciously believe
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.040]   that some of our sins are washed away.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.880]   And he said that's what the tabernacle taught.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.960]   No matter how much they sacrificed, until there is true atonement by the blood of Christ,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.200]   even the good things that we do become unclean.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.880]   That's why when unclean people are leaders of the church, when unclean people are members
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.680]   of the church, it doesn't matter how many good deeds that we participate in, eventually
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.640]   that also becomes unclean.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.520]   Because an unclean man cannot cleanse himself.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.280]   Because it is inner being has been tainted.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:55.480]   So his bitterness, his anger, his selfish motive, his desire to be recognized, his desire
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.360]   to be better than the next person, the coveting, the lying, the tainting that's inside our
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.720]   inner being cannot be cleansed by changing our outer activity.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.060]   And that's what he was saying.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.160]   That all the activity, all the cleansing, all the sacrifices that were given at the
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.400]   tabernacle could not cause them to be clean.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:25.440]   All of this was to simply point to Christ and his coming.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:32.040]   Imagine if you were an Israelite during this time and the tabernacle constantly reminded
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.180]   you that you could not get to God.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.100]   You could not get to God.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:47.760]   Imagine today, imagine today if the access to God was closed to you, how would that affect
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   you?
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.000]   Would that cause you to just have extra time in the morning on Sundays?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.160]   Hold on to your tithe and giving and use that to buy something that you'd like?
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.520]   Maybe go on a nice vacation?
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:09.240]   How would the prohibition of you coming to God was blocked?
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.780]   You know, many Christians struggle with prayer, but imagine if you couldn't pray.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.960]   Not because you were lazy, not because it was difficult, but because the access was
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.080]   closed.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.920]   How would you feel?
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.000]   What would happen?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.400]   What if today was the last day that you and I are able to gather together for worship?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.120]   That this was the last, this is the song that you saw was the last song that you could sing
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   and that was it from this day forward.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.440]   Once this service is over, you're gone into your own homes and you're going to live like
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:46.520]   rest of the world because the access to God has been closed.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.440]   What would happen to you?
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   How would you feel?
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.640]   You see, the nation of Israel was constantly reminded through the tabernacle, the access
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.040]   to God is closed.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.720]   The access to God is closed.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:07.040]   So you can see why Jesus described a single sinner who repents and why the heavens rejoice.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.520]   Because you had a nation filled with people who are eager.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.040]   What is in that Holy of Holies?
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   How can I get to that?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:22.880]   And every year and every sacrifice reminded them, you cannot get in.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.960]   And so when he says earlier in the book of Hebrews, let us enter the throne of grace
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.440]   with confidence.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.280]   Imagine how that would have struck a nation that was constantly reminded that they could
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.200]   not get to God.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.780]   This is what we have in the new covenant.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.880]   The door has been opened.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.960]   That something that we could not do by our own strength, Christ did.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:54.760]   And the weight of what he has done is the reason why you and I are here.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.840]   No amount of religious activity, no amount of giving, no amount of sacrificing, no amount
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.960]   of loving, no amount of preaching the gospel and singing songs can bring us any closer
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   to Christ.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:14.080]   And in the end, ultimately, that's why the tabernacle was created.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.660]   To show us how helpless we are.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:24.720]   To show us that we are outside of the grace of God and his presence.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:30.760]   And to show us a desperate need for a savior and atonement for the coming of Christ.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.280]   See if the nation of Israel was paying attention when Jesus was being crucified, there the
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.780]   cheering and praising would have happened while he was hanging on the cross, not when
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.160]   he was entering into Jerusalem.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.720]   Our celebration of our faith isn't because we live in a comfortable world.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.840]   It's not because we have a nice job.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.280]   It's not because we have a comfortable place to worship.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.600]   That's why Paul says he had found the secret of being content in every and all situation,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.320]   whether he has plenty or has little.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.800]   Whether there's air conditioning or the heat of the sun.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.440]   Whether it is permitted or not permitted.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.520]   Whether it is safe or whether it is dangerous.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:21.400]   Paul's secret of being content is he found his anchor in Christ.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:29.320]   So the challenge for us as Christians who are trying to stay sober in this generation
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   is to ask ourselves, are we constantly engaged in religious repetition without fruit?
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.800]   Because your hearts have drifted far from God.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.280]   You're going through the motion.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.640]   You're doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:56.360]   And you are constantly engaged and having a reputation, have a reputation of being godly,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.840]   but never knowing any power because we are constantly engaged in religious activity when
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.280]   our hearts, we allow our hearts to covet everything else in the world.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.720]   And all of a sudden we say, you know, we're going to, we're going to engage in this and
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.300]   I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:16.680]   And then we wonder why it is so hard to worship God in spirit and in truth.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:23.360]   Are we always learning, always learning about God, about who he is, about Leviticus, about
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.440]   the book of Ephesians, about revelation.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:36.480]   Yet our affection for God in the inner chamber is no deeper than it was when we first started.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.600]   We just have more knowledge.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:46.320]   We just know more about the regulations, know more about theology than affection for God.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.160]   When he says to enter the throne of grace with confidence, we never enter.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.920]   We just observe and appreciate from a distance.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.800]   The door has been opened.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:04.020]   Come, come, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:11.280]   If you've been drifting, if you see your heart's growing cold, becoming numb, maybe some of
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.360]   you here, maybe some of you even sitting at home can imagine yourself not coming to church
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.200]   ever again, or maybe even just drifting away permanently.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.640]   It's like, you know, I think I'm okay with that.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:32.900]   All who are weary and heavy laden, he says, come to me for I will give you rest.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.520]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.960]   find rest for your souls.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.480]   Where do you find your rest?
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.780]   Where do you find your rest?
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.800]   If you believe Christ is your answer and he is your savior and he's the only one who can
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.220]   forgive you of your sins, come to Christ.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.240]   Come to Christ today.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.440]   Don't wait for our next event.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.760]   Don't wait for a prayer time.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.380]   Don't wait for a revival or retreat today.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.940]   Come to Christ.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.800]   Come to Christ.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.520]   Don't appreciate him from a distance.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.340]   You will always learn, but you will never know.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:22.900]   You will hear other people's testimony and be warmed at heart, but you will never know.
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.040]   You will regurgitate information that you hear.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.220]   You will quote great quotes from other people.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.100]   You will tell stories of other people, of things that they've seen, that they've experienced,
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.500]   affection that they have for Christ, but it's never yours.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.220]   Come.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.820]   The door has been opened.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.140]   The curtain has been ripped.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.640]   Come to Christ.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:58.960]   And ultimately, where would you and I be if our sins weren't forgiven?
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.120]   We hear that so many times, it's just a given in the church.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.480]   Imagine if Christ didn't come.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.220]   Imagine if he didn't suffer.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.100]   Imagine if he wasn't crucified.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:20.580]   Imagine if he didn't absorb our sins and you and I still remain in our sins.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.820]   Imagine where you and I would be.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:28.260]   If we die, we meet a holy God, if you believe that.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.140]   Where would we be?
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.380]   Where is our hope?
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.780]   How will you survive when your business fails?
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   What will happen when your children fall sick and you lose your job?
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.860]   What will happen if you retire in tanks?
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:54.340]   Everything that you place your hope on and you are still in your sins.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:34:01.300]   The tabernacle teaches us all of these things that he embedded into the nation of Israel
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:07.840]   so that we may love Christ with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.860]   Church attendance does not save you.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.240]   Being a teacher does not save you.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.900]   Good Sunday school teacher doesn't save you.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.440]   Good worship leader does not save you.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.120]   Good preaching does not save you.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.780]   Being generous does not save you.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.060]   Having a lot of experience does not save you.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.820]   Bearing fruit when you're younger does not save you.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.940]   Sacrificing does not save you.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.860]   Going on missions does not save you.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.620]   Discipling a lot of people does not save you.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.300]   All of these things are religious activity until there is genuine regeneration of our
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:53.900]   hearts that can only be accomplished by the atonement of Jesus that we believe in.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:35:04.300]   So my prayer for all of us, if you are falling asleep, I'm not talking physically, if you're
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:12.420]   falling asleep spiritually and you're okay with it, even if you're offended, my guess
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.500]   is you're not saved.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.660]   That's my guess.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:28.900]   Knowing all that is going on and you are not spiritually sober and you're okay with it,
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.380]   with all that I know of Scripture, all that I have experienced, all that I have seen,
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:43.820]   my educated, my professional guess is you're probably not saved.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:52.740]   So my desire, my prayer is that God would use what is happening now, first and foremost,
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:59.780]   to cause people who are not believers to examine carefully to see where their faith is.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:06.580]   Secondly, for those who are believers, and you've caught yourself drifting, but all of
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.180]   a sudden you realize there is a spiritual battle going on.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:16.260]   There's something more important that you need to be concerned about than your wedding.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.380]   There's something more important that you need to be concerned about than your job.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.420]   There's something more important that you and I need to be concerned about than our
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:29.900]   health, than our children, than our families, than our future, is where do we stand with
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.460]   Christ?
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.140]   Are we still at the old tabernacle going through religious motion, which has no power over
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   us, or have we genuinely met Christ?
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:48.340]   I pray that that may be the case, that we endure the hot sun, we go in, we go back in
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.580]   when they tell us to go back out, you know, go back in, we do whatever we need to do,
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:58.020]   but in the midst of all of this, I pray that revival will break out.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.900]   I genuinely pray that revival will break out, that he would prune the church, and what will
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.980]   remain after this is genuine believers who will love the Lord and worship God in spirit
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   and in truth.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.420]   Let's pray.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:23.540]   Father, you are deserving of all our attention, all our love, all our finances, all our youth,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.780]   all of our retirement, all of our age, all of it, Lord God.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.520]   Help us not to be satisfied with a mediocre walk.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:39.800]   Help us not be okay with just coasting and just making it to next year.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.160]   Help us to be sober, Lord God, to know that we live in a fallen world, that we would not
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   be shocked that the people who are fallen act in accordance to their fallen nature.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.360]   Help us, Lord, to be a light in this dark world, especially now, that our hope may be
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.960]   found in Christ and what he has done.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.440]   Lord, please bring revival in our generation for our sake and for our children's sake.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   Bring revival.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:10.800]   Amen.
