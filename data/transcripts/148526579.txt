[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Let's meet the first Thessalonians chapter 5 16 to 18. We're going to take a break just
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.240]   to prepare us for the Thanksgiving week that's coming up. First Thessalonians 5 16 to 18.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:26.440]   Okay. Reading from verse 16 to 18. Rejoice always pray without seizing in everything
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.320]   give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Let's pray. Heavenly
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.860]   Father we thank you so much for this morning. We thank you Lord God that even in the midst
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.960]   of chaos around the world that we know that our peace is with you. That as long as you
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.660]   are faithful as long as you are gracious Lord God that we know that we are safe and we pray
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.920]   father that we would not respond to all the turmoil like the rest of the world that we
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.840]   know that this is not our home and it's just a constant reminder to us Lord God of the
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.980]   spiritual warfare that we're in. So help us to remain sober help us Lord God to seek the
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.560]   eternal things Lord not temporary safety and we pray father God that our worship may simply
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.940]   be an overflow of all that you have given us in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Merry Christmas.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.380]   All right. I mean sarcastic. Every year it seems like Thanksgiving is just disappearing.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.880]   You know especially this year and I've been saying this for the last few years but this
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.860]   year in particular I don't see Thanksgiving at all. You know it's almost like whenever
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.140]   we talk about Thanksgiving it's about the sale that's coming. Is this you're going to
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.740]   buy it online or you're going to go to the store. You know what stores are going to be
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.500]   open what kind of sales you have outside of that the idea of Thanksgiving is almost disappearing
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.300]   in this country. We have three major Christian holidays at least in the United States. We
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.540]   have Christmas we have Easter and we have Thanksgiving. Christmas is it wasn't really
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.740]   started by Christians it was a pagan holiday that the Christians decided to convert into
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.200]   Christian theme saying that this is when Jesus was born. Actuality Jesus probably was not
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.860]   born in the winter. He probably was born sometime in spring. But again the Christians when they
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.300]   were in power they they decided to well let's let's convert this to a Christian theme. And
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.220]   then Easter obviously again was not a Christian holiday. It was a celebration of some some
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.020]   Persian goddess named Ishtar and that turned into a celebration of Jesus's resurrection.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.180]   Thanksgiving is a unique Christian holiday because it was started by Christians for the
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.060]   purpose of worshiping God. And I think this is one true holiday that that the secular
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.620]   world really doesn't know what to do with. You can't change the name you can't change
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.860]   the meaning because it's embedded into it. So it's almost kind of like the way that Thanksgiving
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.340]   is being attacked instead of focusing on families getting together and having worship and thanking
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.980]   God it's turned into a shopping day you know. And that's pretty much all it's become now.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.460]   I mean you don't see it online. I mean I you know we don't watch television so I don't
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.260]   know what the commercials are but on Facebook you just don't see much of it. You know in
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.380]   fact this year right after Halloween we started seeing Christmas decorations going up you
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.820]   know in the stores and people's houses already. It's almost kind of like okay the shopping
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.020]   day is coming you know and then when that happens and then we focus on Christmas. Thanksgiving
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.140]   really ought to be a day that we are deliberate among all the other days because Thanksgiving
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.660]   is really at the core of what it means to be a Christian. And I know this how Thanksgiving
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.940]   the day only comes once a year but really if we examine the scriptures carefully you'll
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:51.060]   realize that without Thanksgiving you don't have Christianity you don't have worship.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.700]   It's not just about the family gathering together. Thanksgiving is really at the heart and the
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.620]   core of why you and I are here. What worship is ultimately about. The text that we looked
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.660]   at in 1 Thessalonians 5 16 to 18 he doesn't just say rejoice he says rejoice always. He
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   doesn't just say pray he says pray without ceasing constantly and then he says to give
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.300]   thanks in all things rejoice and pray and give thanks in all things for this is the
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.760]   will of God in Christ Jesus for you. This is the will of God. I know there's probably
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.420]   many of you sitting in here who are wrestling with the will of God. Maybe you just had you
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.220]   know DTR with somebody and DTR is determining the relationship. OK. Those of you who are
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.060]   not hip. So that's what DTR means. So maybe some of you guys are wrestling with the idea
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.140]   of should I marry this guy should I get into a relationship with this guy. Maybe you're
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.660]   in the process of finding a new job. Is this the will of God. Should I go on this or that.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.300]   Maybe some of you college students are praying about which field to get into. What is the
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.340]   will of God. Well the Bible is not clear about your vocation. You know no matter how much
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.540]   you search you're not going to have somebody says God says you should do this because it's
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.180]   not clear. Right. There's no mention about you being a lawyer or doctor as the will of
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.720]   God. But there are some things that the Bible says is absolutely crystal clear and every
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.860]   Christian ought to know. Our salvation God's election of us is the will of God. Worshiping
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.700]   glorifying God that is the will of God. Our sanctification that we live in such a way
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.160]   that we glorify and honor God is his will. All the other stuff are things that we need
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:49.060]   to discern. How does being a businessman affect my sanctification. How does me coming to a
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.220]   relationship with this person or that person. How does that affect glorifying God. So everything
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.020]   else that we determine has to fit in under the larger umbrella of what is clearly stated
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.340]   as his will. So the text that we're looking at clearly says one of the primary things
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:14.060]   that God desires and wills for us is that we are thankful. We are thankful. Now it says
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.860]   to be thankful for everything. If he just said be thankful we can sit here and say well
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.140]   what are you thankful for. And I'm sure during this Thanksgiving season you're going to be
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.540]   asked that question a lot. Especially if you're a Christian. What are you thankful for. Right.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.220]   You sit there thinking maybe some of you guys got a new job. You know I'm thankful for that.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.580]   You started a business and it's really taken off. I'm thankful for that. You know I was
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.020]   sick and God answered my prayer and I'm no longer sick. And I'm thankful for that. I'm
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.500]   thankful for my family. Thank you for the health of my children. And we can think about
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.340]   all of these things. But if you look at the context in which Paul is commanding, not suggesting,
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.220]   but commanding the Thessalonians to be thankful, we kind of get a better perspective of what
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:05.620]   Paul is really getting at. You have to remember that the Gospel when it came into Thessalonica
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.180]   it was met with much opposition. In fact the persecution was so intense that they went
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.980]   out looking for Paul and his companions. And because they couldn't find him they ended
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.980]   up going to one of his, one of the key men who became a Christian and they went after
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.180]   him and his family. And in Acts chapter 17, 4-6 it says they actually dragged Jason out
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.900]   of his house and his family, take him to the Roman court and basically saying that these
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.020]   guys are ruining our culture. These guys are coming in, they're rocking the world. We need
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.620]   to do something about this and maybe put them in jail, maybe whip them, maybe even stone
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:50.740]   them. Because it wasn't uncommon at that time to stone people. Paul himself says in 1 Thessalonians
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.780]   1-6, he says the reason why I know that your faith is genuine, that in the midst of much
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:04.620]   opposition that you became followers of Jesus Christ. Think how contrary that is to our
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.260]   culture and the way that we plant churches, the way that we supposedly bear fruit. We
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.340]   want to make it as easy as possible to get as many people to come to church, to have
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.060]   as many people to be serving in the church. But here it says despite. I know your faith
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:26.740]   is genuine, but despite persecution that you came. You know again when we talk about persecution
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.140]   it's not like persecution that you and I face today. You know and I don't think that's something
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.820]   that we should be praying to God, you know bring persecution. I'm thankful that we live
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.460]   in a free country. I'm thankful that my children, that I don't have to worry about my children
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.140]   being stoned going to school just because they're praying for their meal. But the persecution
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:51.500]   that we're talking about in the early church looked a lot like what we see on television
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:58.680]   in the Middle East. Because of what they're saying, a lot of them were stoned to death.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.700]   At minimum they had a very difficult time earning money, income. So imagine today you
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.660]   know it's hard enough to get a job, but because your confession of faith in Jesus Christ that
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.820]   they was just straight out you know to tell you you're a Christian we don't want you.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.300]   You know another businessman maybe you're in the middle of this huge contract and find
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.980]   out you're a Christian and they said no I don't want to do business with a Christian.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.420]   And that's at that's the minimum trials that they had. Most people face that kind of trial
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:33.460]   in the early church. But in this particular church the persecution was so intense you
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.820]   rarely see Apostle Paul packing up his bag and leaving his city. Do you remember in Lystra
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.460]   he gets stoned, dragged out? He goes back in, preaches the gospel. The second missionary
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.620]   journey he comes around he preaches the gospel in that city. So we're not talking about a
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:54.380]   man who was afraid to die. But the persecution in Thessalonica was so intense and he was
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.140]   concerned that not only him but the people converted were all may also get stoned. So
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.020]   he actually packs up his bag and then he leaves Thessalonica. And then remember where he goes?
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:11.620]   He goes to Berea. Right? So I don't think humanly speaking Berea was one of the cities
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.140]   that he was targeting. It just happened that because of persecution he ended up going to
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.820]   Berea. The Thessalonians were so angry about the spread of Christianity they actually follow
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.620]   him to Berea and then he ends up running from there to another city. That's how intense
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.660]   the persecution was in Thessalonica. And the whole reason why he's even writing this letter
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.400]   is because he had to take off and he was concerned that the persecution would have squashed this
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.660]   church. And so he gets the report back and realizes not only were they not squashed,
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:48.660]   they're thriving and they become the model church in Macedonia. And so it is in this
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.460]   context, in the context of this intense persecution, people having a hard time living, possibly
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:02.020]   some maybe even stoning, that he's writing to them. He says, "Rejoice always." I mean
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.900]   rejoice always. You can't get a job. You may be having a hard time feeding your kids. It's
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:15.080]   in that context he's saying this. Pray without ceasing. Be thankful. Be thankful for everything.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.900]   So think about if we were to use our modern paradigm, even among Christians, about what
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.980]   we are thankful for, that we're thankful for a job, we're thankful for safety, we're thankful
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:32.260]   for health. If you look at the church that he is commanding to be thankful for everything,
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:39.860]   humanly speaking, what could they be thankful for? But he commands it. And he commands in
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:46.260]   everything he says. Now what is he referring to? I believe what Paul is saying, and not
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.820]   only here but all throughout the New Testament, the command to be thankful is not simply about
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.700]   our circumstance. He's not saying that because of this, you know, greater things are going
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:03.020]   to come. He's saying be thankful. Be thankful ultimately for what? Because they've been
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:10.560]   saved. That even if they are stoned, even if they can't eat, even if they're being dragged
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.300]   into prison and their children are having a hard time going to school, despite all of
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:21.820]   that, that you are favored by God. That God has sovereignly chosen you for salvation.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:27.460]   That because of your faith, you may be suffering, but in the midst of that, don't forget, you
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:38.300]   have become a child of God. When was the last time that we were truly thankful for our salvation?
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.420]   You know, I know we talk about it, we sing about it, we balk to Scripture, we share our
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.220]   testimonies to one another, but let's be frank and honest with ourselves. When was the last
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:57.420]   time you were really thankful for our salvation? We have a tendency, if we're not careful,
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:08.620]   to trivialize what is fantastic. And then we try to magnify what is trivial. What gift
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:18.540]   have you received that is better than your salvation? What kind of raise did you get
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:24.300]   that was better than what God has given you? What is it possibly that you are desiring
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:33.020]   with all your heart that comes even close to the love of God? And if you really soberly
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.300]   take a step back and think about it, everything that we are hopeful for, everything that we
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:45.740]   are thankful for, everything that we are frustrated with in the context of our salvation, it is
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:54.620]   trivial. But again, you and I have a tendency to trivialize what's fantastic. And then we
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:02.300]   take what is trivial and we try to dress it up and make it fantastic. You know, every
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.700]   time I travel outside the country and people ask me where I live and I say California,
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.500]   most people know where California is even outside the country. They say California is
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:17.540]   big. You know, we're talking about 15, 16 hours of driving from one end to the other.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.220]   So usually the way I would describe where I live, I would tell them I'm near Disneyland.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.980]   Right? That's usually what I say. I'm near Disneyland. And they say, whoa, Disneyland,
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:32.580]   where? I'm about 15 minutes away from Disneyland. You know, and if they've heard about it, you
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:42.940]   know, the next question is what's it like? I say, it's crowded. You know, the food is
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.300]   ridiculously expensive. You know, like one churro is like five bucks. You can get it
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:55.100]   for, so what's a churro? I say, don't worry about it. It's like, you live 10 minutes from
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:03.300]   Disneyland. So, you know, we can become so accustomed. I mean, this is Disneyland, right?
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   That every child that knows about this thinks like, oh, one of these days, you know, if
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.860]   God is gracious enough, I'm going to go to Disneyland, go to California, go to Disneyland.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.180]   You know, some of you guys have annual passes. You've been there so many times you're sick
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.060]   of it. Right? You know, we're at Disneyland and it's like, oh, how was Disneyland? You
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.700]   know, and all we know is that it's crowded. There's a lot of obnoxious people. I hate
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:30.540]   those people with selfie sticks. Man, selfie sticks. I hate it. And instead of talking
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:36.020]   about what Disneyland is about, you talk about what you don't like. Food is expensive. People
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.940]   with selfie sticks. The teenagers making out in the line. Like all the stuff that you can't
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.740]   stand about Disneyland. Like that's what's filled your head. That's what's filled your
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:54.580]   heart. And the thing, the amazing part of us even being near there and being, you know,
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.420]   able to go and being in a free country, having the money and the time to be able to enjoy
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:08.500]   this stuff that 99% of the world can only dream of. See, that's what tends to happen
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.980]   with our faith. The fact that you and I have the freedom to be able to be in this room
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.500]   with air conditioning, with the Bible translation. I mean, we do this even with Bible translations.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.780]   We study the ESVs. Like, ESVs, you know, out of whack. You know, don't study this Bible,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:32.060]   that Bible. We have like 15 different translations to even have the Bible. Which again, majority
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:38.260]   of the world doesn't even have access to this. And we can get so caught up in the trivial
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:48.020]   things in life that we forget what it is that we have in Christ. See, real worship is not,
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.140]   you know, God gave me certain things. And again, you know, next Sunday, if we're caught
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:57.540]   up like the rest of the world, you may come back next Sunday ready to worship because
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.740]   you found the best deals. And you think, "What are you thankful for? Oh, there was a sale
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:10.820]   on iPod Touch. Or there was a sale and iPhone 7 came out and I was first in line. Lord,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:17.620]   you're so good. You're so good. You're so good. And you get in line and somebody cuts
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.100]   and you didn't get it and you know, you couldn't get the color you want. You know what I mean?
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:31.900]   You got the gray one instead of the pink one? Why, Lord? Why?" As trivial as that is, think
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:37.780]   about all the things that frustrate us. And considering what it is that you and I are
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:49.860]   doing this morning, we have access to God. We have access to God. God of the universe.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.300]   Imagine how you feel when you didn't expect it and all of a sudden somebody remembers
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.140]   your birthday. I remember so specifically, I think it was, I'm pretty sure it was my
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.300]   19th birthday. And I was working full time as a janitor, working from 5 to 2 and then
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.660]   during the day I was going to school so I didn't have any human contact. And then my
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.740]   birthday came around in February and I was already feeling like isolated and lonely and
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.860]   I was just like, "Okay, this is one of those, you know, it's going to be one of those hard
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.380]   birthdays that I'm just going to walk through the whole day and no one's going to know."
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.500]   And I was walking by and this guy that I knew in high school from two years ago, I haven't
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.540]   seen him in over two years. Somehow I ran into him and I didn't even have a direct conversation
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.940]   with him. I saw him maybe about a hundred yards away. He recognized me. He said, "Hey
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.100]   Peter!" And I said, "Hey, hey, how you doing?" And he looked at me and he's like, "Hey, happy
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:45.620]   birthday!" And then he walked in. I remember that to this day. There's a little man tear
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:55.580]   on the side that was walking by. "Somebody remember?" It was just a passing thing. I
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:02.060]   was like, "How did he remember?" You know? Something as trivial as that has that kind
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:10.580]   of effect on me even to this day. What about God? I mean, He stepped off His throne. I
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:16.900]   mean, we say this all the time. We sing about this. We exposit this. And you weren't even
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.860]   neutral. You weren't even a friend. The Bible says while we were yet hostile to Him, blaspheming
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:29.740]   His name, we had no concern for Him. And He remembered us. And He cried out and He pursued
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:36.060]   us. And He gave up everything so that you and I can be here and listen to His Word and
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:43.580]   understand that what is happening here didn't just happen. It's because the Son of God gave
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:52.180]   up everything so that you and I could be an adopted child into His kingdom. And yet, if
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.420]   we're not careful, we can say, "Wow, you know, yes, Jesus died for me, but, you know, I've
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.740]   been praying for this bike, but God's not giving me this bike. Yeah, what about, what
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.180]   about this?" Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. I mean, of course, I'm a Christian. I believe
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.340]   that. Yeah, but I've been praying for a bike, though. And He didn't give me a bike. Like,
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:15.260]   what are you thankful for? Yeah, I'm thankful for salvation, but I didn't get my bike. How
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:22.060]   trivial the things that we complain about, things that fill our hearts. See, in 2 Timothy
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.180]   3, 1 and 2, it says, Paul says, "But mark this, there will be terrible times in the
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.900]   last days." Now, I want you to understand this. When Paul is writing this to Timothy,
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.460]   his last letter, he's writing to Timothy to prepare him to be a pastor at the Church of
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:42.700]   Ephesus. When he talks about the condition of the last days, he's not talking about non-Christians.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.940]   He's talking about the condition of the Church. And he says, and you guys remember at the
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.860]   end when Paul says, "To preach the Word in season and out of season." There's going to
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.360]   come a time when people are not going to put up with sound doctrine, but in order to tickle
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.780]   their ears, they're going to gather around them many teachers. But you, preach the Word
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.180]   in season and out of season. He's not talking about the world. He's talking about in the
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:12.380]   Church. And in the Church, he says, "Mark this, there will be terrible times in the
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.780]   last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive,
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:25.360]   disobedient to their parents, ungrateful and unholy." Ungrateful. One of the characteristics
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.900]   of the last days, when their hearts become cold, when they begin to drift away from God,
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:39.220]   one of the characteristics is they're ungrateful. A constant repetition of what they are dissatisfied
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:45.500]   with. In Romans chapter 1, 21, the wrath of God is being revealed. He said, "For although
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:51.820]   they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him. But their thinking
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:22:00.260]   became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened." If Jesus is only an avenue for
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:06.260]   a fulfillment, some sort of blessing in this life, your thankful heart will fluctuate depending
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:11.500]   on the trivial things that happen or don't happen in life. If Jesus is just an avenue
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:17.140]   that you pray to in order for Him to get you a good job or good friends or a certain environment,
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:23.260]   certain community, whatever that may be, when you get it, you're worshiping, you're thankful.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:30.100]   When you don't get it, you're not. If that's all He is. But when Paul commands them to
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.380]   be thankful, he's not talking about based upon our trivial circumstances. That despite
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:43.860]   the persecution, despite the hardships, despite maybe even the possibility of physical harm,
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:49.740]   he says, "Be thankful for everything." You know in Romans when it says that all things
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.660]   work together for good for those who have been called according to His purpose? You
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.900]   know we can take that out of context and apply it and say, "You know what? The hardship that
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.020]   you have right now, God is preparing you for something greater." And so we can misapply
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.980]   it and think that, "You know what? These bad things happened when I was young in order
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.460]   for good things to happen when I'm older. Bad things happened in January so that God
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:18.020]   can prepare us for good things in December." If you look at the context of Roman 8, He's
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:25.180]   not talking about a peaceful, quiet, healthy, wealthy life. He's talking about in the context
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.820]   that all of these things that is happening all over the world and possibly even in your
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.380]   life, God has worked for what purpose? What is the good that He is talking about? Your
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:41.140]   salvation and the salvation of the world. So all the things that He's talking about
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:48.380]   and all of that leading to what is good, He's referring to salvation. That even if you're
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:55.980]   being stung, consider it pure joy because that God has ordained to bring salvation.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.420]   That all the persecution in the early church and many of them even losing their life, He
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.140]   said all of that, who have been called according to His purpose, is for the purpose of salvation.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:10.060]   It is not good because, you know what? Sometimes God causes us to suffer because He has a greater
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:16.300]   thing awaiting for us. My business went bankrupt today so that I can have a multi-million dollar
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.580]   company tomorrow. My relationships went sour today so that I can have better relationships
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:26.780]   in the future. See that's a worldly thinking. The thing that He's talking about that even
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:35.300]   in death, even in death, God is absolutely sovereign. That He who began a good work in
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:41.660]   you will carry it unto completion until the day of Christ. Until you die and come to Christ.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:49.860]   So He has you. What can possibly separate you from the love of Christ? Why thankfulness
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.620]   is so important. You know the story in Luke chapter 17, 11-19. You don't need to turn
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.100]   your Bibles there. You know that's the story of the 10 lepers. Where you know that the
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.700]   lepers at that time, that the illustration of leprosy is the closest thing that we can
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:10.860]   think of of what sin is like. If you had leprosy, it wasn't just that you were sick and you
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.580]   were miserable. You were shunned in society. You couldn't go into worship. You had to tell
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:21.140]   everybody and just coming into contact with you would make them unclean. So it wasn't
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.980]   simply, I mean they were miserable as it was just physically. But in every way they were
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.860]   shunned from society. And people just assumed if you have leprosy it's because you did something
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:36.660]   wrong or your parents did something wrong. So you must have deserved that. Jesus tells
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:43.460]   a story about, or Luke tells a story about when Jesus is going through a part of Samaria.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.780]   These lepers come running to Him and they stood at a distance because they were required
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:53.700]   to stand at a distance. And called out in a loud voice, "Jesus Master have pity on us."
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:26:01.420]   See this is a picture of sin. This is a picture of every single person who doesn't know Christ,
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.820]   whose sins haven't been forgiven. That we are not allowed, we cannot get in the presence
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:12.460]   of this God. He says they cry out, "Have pity on us." When He saw them He said, "Go show
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.580]   yourself to the priests." And the reason why they had to go show themselves to the priests
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:22.020]   is because according to Old Testament law, the priest had to confirm that the disease
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:28.980]   was gone. In order for them to enter into the temple, to be able to walk among the society,
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.780]   He says go show them so that they can be confirmed that a miracle did take place. Well verse
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.700]   15 says, "One of them when he saw he was healed came back praising God in a loud voice."
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:44.860]   One of them. "He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked Him and he was a Samaritan." So
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:50.300]   Luke goes out of his way to describe that this was out of all the lepers, of all the
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.540]   Jews who had all the privileges, of people who saw the miracles and had the prophets
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:03.420]   and had the Torah, among all of them only the Samaritan recognizes who Jesus is. Jesus
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.220]   asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Was no one found to return
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.260]   and give praise to God except this foreigner?" Then He said to him, "Rise and go. Your faith
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:21.340]   has made you well." Now all ten of them were healed. So why does He say to the one, "Your
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:29.980]   faith has made you well?" See his gratitude and his thanksgiving was evidence of his faith.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.700]   Was evidence that something great happened. It wasn't just about his physical healing.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:38.620]   He recognized who Jesus is and he comes and he gives thanks. And he says because of the
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:43.300]   thankful attitude, he recognizes that there was not only a physical healing but a spiritual
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:49.620]   healing that takes place in him. See our biggest issue and our biggest problem living in a
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:58.980]   rich country is that whatever we have it's almost never enough. And it's almost embedded,
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:06.860]   it's almost embedded into our culture to not to be satisfied about something. You know?
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.940]   Anytime do an experiment on Facebook. You know when you have good news put it on Facebook
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.380]   and see what kind of response you get. You'll get congratulations, it's good and whatever.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:22.300]   You know but it doesn't go viral. You put something nasty up on there, oh man it goes,
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:27.500]   it's wildfire. It goes pretty bad. Say something controversial or you have some juicy news
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:33.020]   about somebody negative. I mean it has a tendency because it's kind of embedded into our culture.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.260]   Right? You talk about marriage and you talk about how great marriage is, it's kind of
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:43.020]   like oh my god, what a sap. You know? It's almost like weird to talk about marriage in
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:51.180]   a positive light. To be in a rich country we kind of again have a tendency to point
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.140]   out because you know we're spoiled. See that was a tendency with the nation of Israel.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:04.220]   So Deuteronomy is a three separate collection of Moses' basically speech or presentation
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.060]   or sermon if you will to the nation of Israel as they are preparing to go into the promised
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:14.980]   land. So the word Deuteronomy, the direct translation of that is the second law. And
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:22.240]   what Moses is doing is reminding them what was already taught and causing them to remember.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:29.420]   So the theme of Deuteronomy is to cause them to remember. Remember the law of God and remember
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.900]   who He is and what He has done so that they would give praise and live in obedience when
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:40.460]   they get into the promised land. So over and over again in Deuteronomy it says to remember.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.380]   Deuteronomy 5.15, "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.700]   brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm." Deuteronomy 8.18,
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.580]   "But remember the Lord your God for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth."
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.180]   Deuteronomy 15.15, "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:08.100]   you." And Deuteronomy 16.3, He actually says to put aside a day out of the year, the Passover,
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:13.740]   and go through this whole ritual for the purpose of remembering what God has done. In fact
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.860]   when we get to Nehemiah, Nehemiah prophesies, he says, "The reason why the nation of Israel
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:24.140]   is the way that they are," he says in Nehemiah 9.17, "They refused to listen and failed to
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:30.480]   remember the miracles that you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.540]   rebellion appointed leaders in order to return to their slavery. They followed the ways of
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:43.620]   the nations instead of remembering who their God is." Have you forgotten, maybe some of
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:49.460]   us have forgotten the preciousness of the gift that we have in Christ. Maybe some of
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.660]   you have forgotten what it was like before you met Christ, when you were in your sin.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.260]   Maybe some of you were suicidal before you met Christ. Maybe some of you were lonely,
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:04.140]   maybe some of you were lost, and you didn't know what the reason was, why you need to
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:13.260]   go on. But for whatever it was, every Christian knows, every Christian has to know, who were
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.980]   you before you met Christ, what happened when you met Christ, what happened after you met
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:27.660]   Christ. Because that testimony is your story of salvation. So if you don't have that testimony,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.940]   we question, was there salvation? Because salvation means that we were once this way,
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:37.020]   and then we met Christ, and now we have a new life. Have you forgotten what it was like
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.220]   when you were in your sins? Maybe you've forgotten what it felt like to have God in the universe,
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:50.660]   care about you. Maybe you are more moved by a few of your friends taking you out to dinner,
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:57.220]   than you are with the sovereign God, who've elected you in the midst of your sins. Maybe
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:03.060]   you are more thankful about a trivial gift that you may have received, or maybe a promise
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:10.740]   of a raise from your boss, than you are about the God of the universe knowing your name,
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:17.100]   and He hears your prayers. And what it is that we're doing now has become so mundane
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:23.060]   and trivial. Because we do it every Sunday. We do it every Sunday. Some of you have been
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:30.660]   doing this for 10, 15 plus years. And so now it has become mundane. It's something to do
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.740]   and get done. So when we think about what we're thankful for, that's not the first thing
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:43.180]   that comes to mind. You see, when the spectacular becomes mundane, and we try so hard to make
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:50.540]   the mundane spectacular, we are no longer worshipping God. And that's the temptation,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:57.780]   that's the danger of where you and I are. That we get excited over trivial things, you
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.140]   know. "Oh, I found 20 bucks in my pocket. Oh, I got a sale. There's a sale going on.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:06.740]   I'm going to stand in line. There's a new movie coming in December. Get the tickets,
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:17.140]   get in line, get the people. We're going to fellowship." It's not sin, but we have a tendency
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.980]   to forget what it is that we have in Christ. And something, worship is something to be
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:28.960]   done. And that's where we find life somewhere else. Church is something that I must do.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.060]   Worship is something I have to do because I'm a Christian. But when was the last time
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:39.940]   that we recognized the gift that we have, and the privilege that you and I have to be
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:48.100]   to come and call the God of the universe our Abba Father. Our Abba Father. An ungrateful
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:55.460]   heart leads to all kinds of other sins. A complaining heart does not have room for love
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:03.380]   for others. A complaining heart does not have room to glorify God. An ungrateful heart causes
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:10.020]   us to feel frustrated and bitter. Someone with an ungrateful heart will be unforgiving
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:19.340]   to others. Remember in Matthew 18, 22, 35, Peter asked Jesus, "How many times should
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:26.820]   I forgive my brother?" Seven times? I don't think Peter was asking a hypothetical question.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.780]   I don't think Peter was saying, "You know what, I have this good question." I was just
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.240]   thinking, I was just in my room thinking one day, and I was thinking, "How many times
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.420]   I should forgive?" I think somebody was annoying Peter. You know, I can think of a few people
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.740]   among that group that might be annoying Peter. Peter is a go-getter, right? He's a go-getter.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:51.620]   So anybody who gets in his way is going to be annoying to him. You know who was the primary
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:58.820]   guy? You know, it's usually the bean counters. I'm talking about the tax collector. Peter
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:06.860]   is not into details. Peter is like, "Let's do it! Is that you, Jesus? Call me out!"
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.660]   That's Peter. And I bet you Matthew is in the back, he's like, "Foolish, foolish."
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:17.900]   And you probably say, "Why is he doing that? What's he doing?" You know? He's like, "Yes,
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.420]   you know, let's do it! We're going to conquer!" And takes out a sword, about to fight. You
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.820]   know? Matthew is like, "Oh my gosh, it's this guy. We're outnumbered." You know, and this
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.380]   guy is getting, I can think of a few people. Judas, remember? You know, every time they
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:36.580]   use money, he's like, "That could be used for the poor." Liar. Right? But you could
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.980]   tell, you know, I mean, think about the 12 disciples that they had. They had some interesting
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:47.220]   characters. I mean, you had a zealot in there with a tax collector. I mean, zealot, one
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.860]   of the first people that he would have killed was a tax collector. Think about it. Because
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:59.660]   he considered Matthew a traitor. And that's worse than the Romans. This guy sold us out.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:06.260]   And so he put them together. Right? He put Judas, and you had these guys. If you left
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.740]   James and John alone, they would have been mass murderers. They were in Samaria. "Hey,
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.220]   these guys won't accept us. You want fire to come down and consume all these people
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.020]   because these three guys wouldn't help us?" You know what I mean? And so you have those
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.900]   12 people. I think when Peter was asking the question seven times, I think, I have a feeling
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:31.540]   that he already did it seven times. So Jesus said seven times, like, "Yes! This is the
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:37.740]   eighth time. Now I'm going to get this guy." Right? So Peter asked him seven times, and
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.660]   Jesus said, "Seven times seventy." Like, "Oh my gosh. That's going to take forever." And
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.100]   obviously you know the point that Jesus is trying to get to. And then it's in that context
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:53.660]   he tells this illustration. He tells a story about a servant who owed all this money. And
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:37:03.500]   the money that he describes is 10,000 talents. One talent is equivalent at that time to 15
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:11.460]   years of labor. 15 years of labor. We're talking about 150,000 years of labor. Now, Jesus was
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.740]   exaggerating. You know, you could have said, "Oh, he owed a couple million." He said, "He
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:24.060]   owed trillions of dollars." Who lent him this money? I don't know. But you know what he's
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:30.500]   describing here, right? When he's describing the money that he lent, he's describing sin.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:39.540]   Right? He's describing sin. He's saying this guy was forgiven 150,000 years of labor, and
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.940]   then he is let go, and then there's another servant. His servant comes around, and he
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:53.020]   owed 100 denarii. A hundred denarii was worth about 18 days. $18 a day for about 100 days.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.900]   So we're talking about maybe 3, 4, 5 months or something like that of labor. And it was
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:05.660]   trivial compared to. So there's a reason why he exaggerates the amount the first one owed
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:10.520]   versus the second one. Because the exact point that he was trying to get at is, "You were
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:16.940]   forgiven this much sin, and yet for a few months' worth of salary, you're willing to
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.860]   beat him and put him in prison?" And so he said, "Then the master called the servant
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:28.020]   in, 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all the debt yours because you begged me to.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.900]   Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had on you?' In anger,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:39.300]   his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:45.500]   he owed, which is absolutely impossible. This is how my heavenly Father will treat each
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.780]   of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.'" Now you know who he was talking
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:39:00.380]   to? Peter. Peter was saying seven times, he said, "Peter, if you don't forgive your brother,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:06.100]   this is who you are. You are the wicked servant. Considering what you have been forgiven, and
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:15.300]   you refuse to forgive, what is trivial?" See, an unthankful heart will be unforgiving because
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:23.420]   we have forgotten what it is that we have been given. I think this is a good illustration
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:29.620]   of our perspective of why we should be thankful. He said, "I am thankful for the taxes that
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.420]   I pay because it means I am employed. I am thankful for the clothes that fit a little
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.940]   too snug because it means I have more than enough to eat. I am thankful for a lawn that
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.660]   needs mowing, windows that need cleaning, and gutters that need fixing because it means
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:51.820]   I have a home. I am thankful for the spot I find at the far end of the parking lot because
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.260]   it means I am capable of walking. I am thankful for my huge heating bill because it means
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:03.220]   I am warm. I am thankful for all the complaining I hear about our government because it means
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:09.900]   we have freedom of speech. I am thankful for the person behind me in church who sings off-key
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:15.500]   because it means I can hear. I am thankful for piles of laundry and ironing because it
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:22.300]   means my loved ones are nearby. I am thankful for the alarm that goes off in the early morning
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:32.460]   hours because it means that I'm alive." How much of our culture, how much of what we are
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:38.780]   thankful for, not thankful for, is because we have completely missed, because we've forgotten
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:44.020]   what it is that we have in Christ. See, when we don't have a thankful heart, we can't worship
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.780]   God. We can't worship God. We can come in here and check off the list and you become
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:56.140]   more of an examiner than worshiper. You examine to see what's going on and you're never really
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:04.740]   able to give worship. You know, Thanksgiving, technically it said it happened 1621, but
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.380]   the Thanksgiving was really inspired by the event that happened 11 years prior in 1610.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:19.620]   409 settlers came to America and that first winter was so cold that only 60 people remained
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:26.260]   after that winter, out of 409. And so you would think that after majority of the people
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:30.060]   dying off, they would come at the other end saying, "God, we came here seeking religious
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:35.820]   freedom to worship you. Why did you bring us here?" Instead, that was the beginning of
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:42.620]   Thanksgiving, that those who remained decided to thank God for his blessing, that they were
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:49.740]   able to live and have a harvest the next year. And that's the background behind Thanksgiving.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:54.260]   That our Thanksgiving is not because we got a good job, because we have health, we have
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:59.700]   good things that happen just like the rest of the world. That even if the worst possible
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:08.060]   thing can possibly happen in our life, that we have Christ. Even if the most wildest dream
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:16.380]   in this world happens, it is only temporary. And one day we're going to be with him. And
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:23.620]   so this Thanksgiving, again, is a reminder for us, is to get us realigned and get us
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:31.460]   refocused. What causes Thanksgiving in you? What causes you to be worshipful to God? Trivial
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:40.340]   things or ultimately because God saved and loved you? In Psalm 145, "Enter his gates
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:46.540]   with thanksgiving and his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and praise his name. For
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:52.940]   the Lord is good and his love endures forever. His faithfulness continues through all generations."
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.740]   Would you join with me and take a minute to pray as we invite the praise team to come
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:02.580]   up? Let's take some time to not make a list of, "Here are the things that I'm thankful
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.620]   for," but just ask yourself, "When's the last time you really celebrated God's grace in
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:14.100]   your life?" Not just verbally, not just telling other people, but in your heart. And until
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:20.020]   we remember the height that we have fallen, until we are celebrating the salvation that
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.900]   we have in Christ, all the other things that we're concerned about, all the other things
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.460]   that we're not satisfied with, are trivial. Let's make the spectacular spectacular and
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.500]   trivial trivial. Let's come before the Lord and take some time to pray as our worship
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.140]   team leads us.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.060]   (flames crackling)
