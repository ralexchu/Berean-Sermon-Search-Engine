[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   This morning, I have the privilege of sharing with you, essentially for my devotions, a
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.960]   bird's eye view of the Book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.000]   So would you please turn your Bibles there?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.720]   Because I'm going to be giving a bird's eye view of it, we're going to be hitting a lot
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.120]   of passages.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.080]   And so just as a forewarning, I'm going to ask you to refer to and kind of jump around
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.440]   just a little bit between from passage to passage.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.600]   And before we jump in, we will take a moment to ask for the Lord's blessing on our time.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.760]   So let's pray.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.840]   Father, we want to thank you so much.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.360]   We thank you so much for your incredible grace.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360]   You showering your mercies and your love upon us.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600]   Thank you so much for Kat and what you have done in her life.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.800]   Thank you, Father God, for the light that you shine through her.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.360]   We pray that every single one of us would have a fellowship of spirit and unity because
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.680]   of the grace we receive, because of our common relationship with you.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.480]   This morning, God, as we open up your word, this morning as we hear your truth, grant
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.860]   to us greater conviction that God, our faith would be grown and matured.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.240]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   Amen.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.040]   Back almost like 12 years ago, I used to teach at an academy, an after school academy, and
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.560]   I used to teach lots of subjects from English.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.120]   But one of the subjects was actually what's called public forum debate.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.440]   Now within the world of debating, there is a really common term that they use, which
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.200]   is the horror of the status quo.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440]   The horror of the status quo.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   And what that means is if you're debating and arguing anybody, you have to show somebody
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   why they need to hear you.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.000]   If you're trying to win an argument or you're trying to enact a policy or you're trying
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.160]   to convince your wife that you need a new tool in the garage, you have to show and convince
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.800]   her or anybody that there is a need for this.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.920]   For example, if I did need a new tool, I could show her all day like, "Look how this thing
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   shines.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   Look how sharp it is.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.200]   Look how amazing and great it is.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.160]   Look how much on sale it is."
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   But what's she going to say?
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.280]   She's like, "I know it looks great, but you don't need it."
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.520]   You don't need it.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   So what do I have to do?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.040]   I have to explain to her like, "Oh my goodness, I just spent and wasted three hours because
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.920]   I didn't have the right tools.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.300]   I almost cut my hand.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.440]   You don't want me to hurt myself, do you?"
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.000]   I have to go over to my neighbor, like Jim's house, to borrow this tool and I know you
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.160]   don't like Jim.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.120]   Whatever it may be, you just start to enhance the horribleness, how bad it is right now
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   that I don't have this tool.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.960]   It's dangerous.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.040]   That's what's called the horror of the status quo.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   When you look at the book of Ecclesiastes, you guys know in general this book is not
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.600]   like an upbeat book.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.400]   This book is trying to summarize for you the horror of the status quo when King Solomon
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.480]   looks at the world.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.600]   From a bird's eye view as king, as one of the wisest men to walk the earth with discretion,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.680]   understanding, with prose, poetics, and proverbs, he is giving to us a reality, a picture of
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.960]   the world.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.760]   And that's the wisdom we're supposed to gain from this book.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.000]   Turn your Bibles to chapter 1, verse 1, Ecclesiastes, and this is what he says.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.360]   The words of the preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem, "Vanity of vanities," says
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.360]   the preacher.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.480]   "Vanity of vanities."
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.400]   All is vanity.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.440]   When he is looking at the world, he is trying to convince you and give to you wisdom, and
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.540]   he wants you to see it like he sees it.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.360]   Everything is vain.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.920]   There is emptiness.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.880]   There is futility.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.840]   There is meaninglessness.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.760]   And my case to you this morning is going to be that no, King Solomon is not exaggerating.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.600]   He's not just speaking in literary form.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.120]   He's telling you the truth.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.120]   He's giving you godly wisdom.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.540]   I want to begin in King Solomon's argumentation.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.400]   He tells you that this world is absolutely pointless.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.880]   Okay?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.460]   Absolutely pointless.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.840]   What I mean by that is when something is pointless, it means there's no goal here.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.360]   What's the point up there, right?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   What's the motivation here?
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   What's the meaning?
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.840]   And he says, "There's nothing.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.740]   It's all vain."
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.880]   To prove this point, he gives us a couple categories, and he says, "You know what's
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   pointless?
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   It's all the work you do."
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.760]   Take a look at verse 3.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.280]   Chapter 1, verse 3 tells us, "What advantage does a man have in all his work, which he
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.440]   does under the sun?"
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   And then he gives to you in the rest of the book this rationale.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.680]   "Well, you know what I've seen?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.560]   I've seen a guy sweat, toil, labor for days, sacrifice, and everything, there's
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.600]   actually no reward.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.240]   I've seen a guy work until he's old, and he doesn't even get to enjoy it, and he
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.720]   gets to give it to his son, who squanders it away."
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.640]   What on earth is the point?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.800]   And if you recall, God himself has told us there is a pointlessness built into the current
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.000]   system, because man will work by the sweat of his brow, and he will till the ground,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.040]   but it will bear no fruit.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.360]   There is a fruitlessness into the pattern of the world.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.680]   Speaking of pattern of the world, we realize that King Solomon teaches us there is a pointless
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.680]   pattern to everything he sees.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.720]   For those of you guys, again, thinking about maybe work and sometimes how fruitless it
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   is, many people complain, "Oh, the drudgery.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.360]   You punch in, you punch out, and the day just repeats itself, and it's just like a wheel.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.440]   You just keep going and going.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.000]   I don't know how much more I can take this."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.080]   Starting from verse 4, Ecclesiastes chapter 1, verse 4, King Solomon says this, "A generation
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.160]   goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.480]   Also the sun rises and the sun sets, and the hastening to its place, it rises there again,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   blowing toward the south, towards the north, the wind continues to swirl."
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   What is he saying?
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   He is saying in poetical form, there is just this monotonous routine and pattern to the
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.400]   world, and whether you like it or not, it's just going to happen.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   You have very little control over this.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.760]   What's going to happen is you're going to work, and then you're going to die, and then
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.480]   the pattern is going to repeat itself, and someone's going to replace you.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.120]   King Solomon has this angst, like he's a king.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.240]   He asks this question, "I'm a king after another king."
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.120]   You remove a guy, and another guy comes in.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.440]   There is this grievous thing, even if something is horrendous or something is good, there
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.840]   is this pattern in life that you cannot escape.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.360]   I think people feel that angst.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.960]   I see sometimes people tell me, "Pastor Mark, I quit."
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   "What did you quit?"
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.720]   "No, no, no, it's just my job.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.040]   I just couldn't take it anymore.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.400]   I just didn't see a future.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.600]   Every day was the same.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.880]   I couldn't see advancement.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.520]   I couldn't see myself learning anything, and so now I just quit."
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.800]   "Do you have anything lined up?"
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   "No, I just couldn't take it."
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.160]   Sometimes people do that.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.000]   Part of it is there's a rhyme and reason behind that.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.840]   Do I think it's the wisest thing in the world to quit without something in Don Deck?
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.080]   Not necessarily, but there's a rhyme and reason through that, and King Solomon sees it.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.560]   You know what else he says?
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.320]   When people start to feel this kind of angst of the patterns and then the pointlessness,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.160]   what they do is they turn to pleasure.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.440]   King Solomon has done the same.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.320]   Turn your Bibles over to chapter 2, verse 1, and look what King Solomon says.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.200]   He says, "I said to myself," he's talking to himself now, "Come now, I will test you
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.320]   with pleasure.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.360]   So enjoy yourself, and behold, to its futility.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.680]   I said to laughter, 'It was madness and of pleasure.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.840]   What does it accomplish?'
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.240]   wisely, how to take hold of folly until I could see what good there is for the sons
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.000]   of men to do under heaven for the few years of their lives."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.440]   Basically, he said, "You know what I decided to do?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.680]   I just decided to live it.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.600]   I decided to go look for some meaning.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.360]   I decided to go look for some pleasure.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.800]   At least in this short time of this whole monotonous routine, I can enjoy it."
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.760]   And then he says, "I enlarged my works.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.120]   I built a house for myself.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.400]   I planted vineyards for myself."
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.720]   He basically just says, "You know what?
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.320]   You name it, I had it.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.440]   I had houses.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.120]   Some of you guys are like on Redfin, on whatever websites, you're like, 'This might be a good
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120]   time to buy.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   The rates are so low.'
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.320]   And then you think that buying that home is going to be grand.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   Talk to any homeowner.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   They're going to be like, 'Oh my goodness.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.720]   This is broken, that's broken, and there's no end.'
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   Right?
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.560]   It's a different perspective.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.280]   But what's more, he says in verse 10, "All that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.600]   I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.480]   labor, and this was my reward for all my labor.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.320]   Thus I considered all my activities which my hand had done, and the labor that I exerted,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.480]   and behold, all was vanity."
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.040]   King Solomon is giving you wisdom.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   He's speaking and he's saying, "Those of you who are younger, looking forward to your life,
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   thinking, 'You know what?
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.720]   Once I get there to that job, once I have that home, once I have that possession,' and
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   you think you're going to be satisfied.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.960]   I have gone before you.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.480]   None of it is satisfying, and none of it seems to have a point."
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.320]   And that's why there are individuals who are filthy rich, because King Solomon was filthy
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   rich.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.720]   There are individuals who have celebrity status, and they hate it.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.040]   Why?
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.920]   Because they realize, 'I'm not sure there was a point to all that.'
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.400]   You know, the sermon is starting to sound like a real downer.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.800]   As I was meditating and preparing for this, you know, I was doing devotions in this, and
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:55.120]   I was going really slow, and I realized, "Wow, King Solomon has such a bleak look on life."
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.680]   But it gets worse.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.140]   The next point is that the entire world is helpless.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.780]   When you see that there are these woes, there are these patterns of life, and then the pointlessness
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:11.000]   of life, your temptation is to want to fix it, but what King Solomon says is, "It's helpless,"
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.700]   meaning it's unfixable.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.440]   Take a look back at chapter 1, verse 12.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.600]   So I know we're flipping around here and there, but go to chapter 1, verse 12, and he says,
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.360]   "I, the preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem."
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.080]   Wait, he's king.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.120]   He's got authority, he's got power.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.760]   If anybody can see something and be like, "Fix it," that's the king.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.160]   But you know what he says?
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.360]   "I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been under the heavens,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.320]   and it is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.120]   I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.760]   and striving after wind."
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.320]   Now listen to this.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.640]   What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   Do you hear that?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.080]   Number one, whenever you're trying to look for a solution, you have to thoroughly understand
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.460]   the problem, but he says, "I tried.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.600]   You guys, I tried.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.720]   I tried to wrap my head around it, and I couldn't because it could not be counted how many things
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.320]   are wrong."
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.960]   Just this past weekend when it was 4th of July, I went down to San Diego to visit.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.440]   It was wild because what ended up happening was right when we were there, just before
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:34.600]   one of their neighbors, their three-year-old drowned in the pool, in an induced coma in
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   the hospital.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.400]   And then you look on the news in San Diego, there was a man who drove off the cliff with
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.080]   his daughters, young daughters in his car.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.480]   If you're the type to like listening to news, you know what he's saying.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.840]   There is so much wrong in the world.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.760]   You get sick of it.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.480]   Yes?
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:12:01.320]   Even if you were king, could you even count all the vices, all the injustices that happen?
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.960]   You keep reading chapter 1, verse 16, and he says, "I said to myself, 'Behold, I have
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.040]   magnified and increased wisdom more than all who are over Jerusalem before me, and my mind
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.040]   has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.440]   I set my mind to know the wisdom and to know madness and folly.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.680]   I realize that this also is striving after wind, because in much wisdom there is much
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   grief.'"
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:34.080]   Brothers and sisters, when you look at the world, there is sin, there is wretchedness,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.800]   there is wickedness built into the system.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.080]   And for anybody who thought, "We can fix this."
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.840]   For anybody who thought, "If only we had greater know-how and wisdom."
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.760]   King Solomon had it.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.200]   He was the king who was much wiser than any before him.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.980]   He was given wisdom to rule his nation.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:02.720]   And he's telling us in wisdom, "I have dedicated myself to learn how to govern this kingdom.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.560]   And let me tell you something, it's been painful."
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.480]   That's what he's saying.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.840]   Now, when you think about this, he was a bona fide genius.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.640]   He was somebody who actually had the power to tell a subordinate individual, "You, stop
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.760]   or kick somebody out or do this," and instantaneous.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.680]   He didn't even have to go through a procedure.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:32.560]   He spoke in the kingdom and it was, and yet still, he is convincing us, "I tried.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.400]   But this world is helpless."
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   Oh my goodness.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.080]   I got to be honest, as I was doing my devotions, there's a part of me is like, "Why so down,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   King Solomon?
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.960]   Why are you so like a pessimist?"
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   You know?
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.000]   Like, "You are probably the most like, you know, bawl-humbug person I've ever read in
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   the Bible."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Right?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I mean, there are many.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.520]   But my goodness, chapter after chapter of this, you know, for those of you guys who
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.920]   read through Ecclesiastes, this is the bulk.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.480]   Everything is futility.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.480]   Everything is vanity.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.760]   Now, I might say to him, "King Solomon, I think you're maybe a little over exaggerating.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.920]   Everything, like everything is hopeless."
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.480]   And what King Solomon is going to say to us is, "No, you don't understand.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.600]   I'm not exaggerating here.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:27.320]   He is trying to show us in wisdom and prove to us this world is not as it seems."
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.200]   And so he continues.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.540]   He tries to convince us and say the next point that this world is hopeless.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:41.640]   Not only is it pointless, not only is it helpless, it is utterly hopeless.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.540]   Turn over to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 18.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.580]   In Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 18, this is what King Solomon says, "I said to myself
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:57.820]   concerning the sons of men, 'God has surely tested them in order for them to see that
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.720]   they are but beasts.'
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.960]   The fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.960]   As one dies, so dies the other.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.300]   Indeed, they all have the same breath, and there is no advantage for man over beast,
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.980]   for all is vanity.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.520]   All go to the same place.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.540]   All came from the dust, and all return to the dust.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:25.020]   Who knows that the breath of man ascends up, and the breath of the beast ascends down to
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.020]   the earth?"
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.400]   The question is, why do you assume you're that much better than the beast?
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.260]   Why do you assume your future is so much better?
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.060]   Now truth be told, way of wisdom and way of righteousness is so much better than folly,
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.040]   but there is this radical truth King Solomon bears upon us to convince us, look at the
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.380]   world for what it is.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:52.180]   Whether you're wise or you're a fool, your destination is the same, which is you will
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.120]   die the same horrible death.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.220]   This is the horror of the status quo, and his logic is sound.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.180]   Someone might say, "Wait a minute Pastor Mark, you believe in fate?"
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.940]   King Solomon talks much about fate.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.580]   And what you realize is, you know what the dictionary definition of fate is?
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.000]   The dictionary definition of fate is simply a development of events that is radically
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.180]   beyond a person's control.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.480]   Then yes!
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.360]   You see King Solomon is trying to convince you in wisdom, you presume way too much about
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.180]   yourself.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.260]   You presume way too much about this world, because his scenario is not too far off from
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.640]   ours.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.260]   To think that because you're wealthy, to think that because you're in power, that the world
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.900]   is as it should be, is actually false.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.100]   You do recognize the kind of time of peace we are in compared to the rest of history.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:59.220]   To assume that this is the way it ought to be, we are living in a unique time.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.940]   What's more, you don't even have to look that far into history.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.180]   Look compared to the rest of the world.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:12.620]   You and I are living in a radical sense of privilege and peace compared to the rest of
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.320]   the world.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.620]   But then to assume this is the way it ought to be, King Solomon is saying, "You don't
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.540]   understand.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.820]   We are so subject to fate because you are not in control.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:31.420]   And the humility you need to learn is actually you're just like the beast."
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.660]   When you think about this, what he's saying is, "You're hopeless.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.340]   What hope do you have?
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.620]   You're going to strive, you're going to toil, you're going to labor, but when it comes down
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:49.540]   to it, you're going to face the same exact consequence of our finite human sinful state.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.720]   You're going to die."
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   That is an absolute reality.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.040]   Let me just say something here.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.480]   This is, yes, is a sad, sad state of events.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.900]   But I am willing to bet a lot of you, I'm willing to bet a majority of you, you know
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.380]   very well there is nothing guaranteed that you're going to have 70 years of your life.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.920]   The vast majority of you probably by the time you hit high school, you already knew somebody
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.820]   who died way too early.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.660]   You probably already know individuals that have, you can say, like, it was so unfortunate.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.060]   But the fact of the matter is none of us are guaranteed that.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.460]   And so we have a sad state of hopelessness.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:34.160]   Now moving to the second kind of section of the sermon and transitioning, you could take
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.900]   a look at this and just say, "Wow, this is just so sad."
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.900]   But there is a question, what do you do with this knowledge?
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.660]   When you see, like King Solomon sees, when you see the pointlessness and the meaninglessness,
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.900]   when you see how helpless it is, when you see how hopeless it is, what are you supposed
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.080]   to do?
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.980]   Because the scenario is so far above and beyond worse than we think it is.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.400]   There's so many things that are hidden.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.540]   Just right now, some of you guys know I'm in school.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:10.820]   I have to write a paper on youth suicide and to look up statistics.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.540]   The sad state of affairs is in any given day, there are over 135 individuals who commit
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.140]   suicide in the US.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.820]   And we're thinking, "What?"
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.220]   But that's not even counting just simply individuals who have attempted suicide.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.380]   The attempt count is above 1.4 million per year.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.980]   Okay, King Solomon, my point to you was King Solomon is not exaggerating.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:45.540]   If you try to sit and count, if one death is grievous, how many more is 50,000?
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:52.020]   How many more individuals were at 1.4 million individuals attempting suicide in America?
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.260]   What I'm saying here is, what do you do with that?
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.380]   And King Solomon gets real, really fast.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:04.860]   Turn your scriptures over to chapter 2, verse 17 of Ecclesiastes.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:10.780]   And when you think about this, if we actually believed and saw like King Solomon, that all
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.340]   your feeble attempts to fix deaths didn't work.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.740]   And as a matter of fact, maybe some of us desperately looked to other people to help
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.100]   us.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.180]   And we desired other people to come and save us.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.700]   And we recognize people themselves are very disappointing.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.220]   And sometimes when people try to get involved, it just makes matters worse.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.020]   And you feel this hopelessness.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.500]   There are no other recourses to turn to.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.740]   What ends up happening?
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:40.320]   Well, King Solomon says this, verse 17, chapter 2, "So I hated life.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.900]   For the work which I had done under the sun was grievous to me, because everything is
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.660]   futility and striving after wind.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.820]   Thus, I hated all the fruit of my labor."
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.940]   What is he saying there?
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.060]   He hates life.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.860]   Ecclesiastes chapter 4, for the sake of time, just listen to this.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.620]   He says, "I look again at the acts of oppression which are done under the sun."
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.620]   He looks at injustice.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.940]   "I and I saw behold the tears of the oppressed, that they have no one to comfort them.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.440]   And on the side of the oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.060]   So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.500]   The better off than both is the one who never existed."
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.820]   Whoa.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.100]   We have to take a moment to meditate.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.460]   Is King Solomon saying to die is better?
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.620]   Is he even advocating?
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.620]   How dare he?
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.080]   Like suicidal thoughts?
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   This is not what you teach children.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.780]   This is not what you teach the church.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.840]   This is not how you encourage people.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.820]   What on earth is he doing?
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.100]   Isn't this bothersome?
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.100]   This is very bothersome.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.740]   And I'll tell you what, even in my own heart as I was doing devotions through these passages
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.540]   and meditating on these truths, there was a part of me that was resisting.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.960]   There was a part of me that was resisting and saying, "Ah, King Solomon just sounds
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   like a bitter guy."
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.440]   Right?
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.280]   Maybe it was because he had way too much.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.140]   Maybe it was because he was relishing in all these pleasures and it got to his head.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.140]   Maybe that's why.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.140]   No, no.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:20.340]   King Solomon actually begins to show us there was another way for me to behave.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.340]   There was another way for me to react.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.260]   You know what that way was?
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.100]   It's the way what I like to call, you just do the best with what you got.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.100]   Right?
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.300]   You essentially kind of deceive yourself and you lie to think you try to make the most
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.380]   of what you have.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.420]   And the motto that a lot of parents teach their kids is, "You know what?
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.020]   When you get lemons in your life, what you do is you add a dash of sugar and you make
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.020]   lemonade."
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.020]   Right?
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.860]   And we think that's such good advice.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.300]   What's really interesting is to some degree King Solomon gives this kind of advice in
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.860]   almost a sarcastic tone.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.260]   Turn your Bibles over to Ecclesiastes chapter 5, verse 18.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.260]   Okay?
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.140]   Ecclesiastes 5, verse 18.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.540]   So what I'm saying here is number one, when you see the hopelessness of the world, you
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.980]   can end up simply hating your life and wishing you never existed.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.380]   Or number two, you can do what's called you make the most of it.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.380]   You just live.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.380]   Right?
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.180]   And this is what he says.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.540]   Verse 18, "Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting, to eat, to drink, enjoy
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.220]   oneself in all one's labor, in which he toils under the sun, during the few years of his
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.780]   life which God has given him.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.860]   For this is his reward."
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.860]   You know what's kind of funny?
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.460]   I read that as though he was actually giving an advice.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:37.660]   I'm going to take a moment to do like a little personal like confessing here.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.100]   There was a part of me as I was looking at the wretchedness of the world through the
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.780]   eyes of King Solomon, I felt resistance.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.860]   And I couldn't necessarily put a finger on it, but I think I want to explain it to you
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.600]   in this way.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.740]   We recognize there's impulses of our hearts.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.980]   And there's a part of me that wants to fight back and say, "But are you saying like give
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   up on everything?
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.540]   Should I teach my own son like don't go to school?"
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.540]   Right?
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.820]   Should I tell my church people like, "You know what you're doing?
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.820]   It's stupid.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.820]   Stop."
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.740]   No, you're supposed to still work.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.280]   You're supposed to still build a family.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.340]   You're supposed to still live, come to church.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.980]   You're supposed to still grow.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   Right?
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.860]   So part of me felt this like reactionary thing.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.700]   But what's really interesting about this is in another passage, King Solomon tells a young
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.340]   man, "You know what, young man?
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.900]   You have a short time to live.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.500]   Go pursue your passions.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   Go fulfill your lust.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.900]   But just remember God's going to judge you for all of it."
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.100]   What he was doing was being sarcastic.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.180]   This is purely just wisdom of the world.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.820]   I'm trying to teach you something better.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.500]   And so now this is the center and heart of the message.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:47.380]   I'm trying to show you that King Solomon has words of wisdom for us.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.800]   Even if your heart is resisting, first recognize that he is seeing the world appropriately
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.580]   for what it is.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   Right?
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.340]   There is, yes, a temptation in our heart to look at King Solomon and say, "No, King Solomon."
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.460]   Again, straight up like I was kind of like, "You know what?
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.700]   Maybe King Solomon is doing this kind of like woke culture stuff where he's like, 'You think
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.700]   you have it good.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.700]   You don't know.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.700]   This is so bad.'"
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.700]   You know?
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.100]   Like, is he exaggerating?
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.260]   And again, my conviction is no.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:24.540]   He is trying to teach us any kind of hope in this world is going to be a tragedy.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.140]   When you think that you're going to wisen up, when you think that you're going to self-improve
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:36.100]   so that incrementally you can make this life better, it's all monopoly.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.940]   I meditated deep and long about this, so jot this down in your notes.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.260]   It's all monopoly.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:49.140]   Let me try to explain why I found this to be both in my heart and yet this to also still
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.140]   be vanity.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.860]   Have you guys all played that game Monopoly?
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.860]   I'm sure you have.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.740]   It's such a classic, right?
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.260]   That game Monopoly, it's a game that takes a long time to play.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:04.020]   It's a game where you win property and you get to charge people rent when they land on
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   it.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.580]   You know what's really funny is I Googled that game and I asked this question of Google,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.380]   when does the game end?
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.380]   Right?
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.220]   And what's really funny is there's so many entries.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.740]   There was like blog posts about this and some people responded by saying, "You know when
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.740]   Monopoly ends?
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.500]   It is when you cry.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.660]   It always ends in tears.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.900]   You know when Monopoly ends?
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   It's when your brother points the finger at you, accuses you of cheating, flips the board
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.100]   and all your houses go flying."
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.540]   You know when Monopoly ends?
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.740]   And then somebody wrote, "Never."
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.060]   It never ends.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.300]   And then somebody wrote, "You'd have to be one kind of special jerk to insist that we
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.560]   actually end the game."
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.580]   Because you guys know who've actually played this game, how it ends.
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.540]   There can be only one.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.660]   The game ends when everybody else has to declare bankruptcy and you're the only person standing
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.700]   with property.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.500]   That's how the game ends.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.580]   I played this with my family recently.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.580]   It's so sad.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   Right?
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.460]   The little one, he's sitting there, he's having to pay all this rent and stuff.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.220]   He's got like $4 in his little hands and he like, he stands up to look at the board.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:16.540]   He rolls and you know us as parents, we can count the squares faster so we're like, "Oh
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.540]   no."
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.420]   And part of you, you feel sympathy so what do you do?
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.020]   You almost want to cheat the game for him.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.020]   Just roll again.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.020]   That roll didn't count.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.020]   Right?
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.700]   You don't know where he's going to land.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.460]   The party was like, "Oh no, it's okay.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.700]   You want to loan him some money."
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.820]   You know what the game rule says?
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.420]   You're not allowed to loan people money.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.620]   Part of you wants to almost cheat him and like miscount and be like, "Oh no, you land
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.620]   here."
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.780]   Right?
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:46.620]   Or you just desire to keep this game going even though you know there's no chance for
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.660]   him to survive with $4.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.860]   This is where I realized my heart was too.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.100]   There is this weird defense against King Solomon to say, "No, no, no.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.580]   We can make this work.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.780]   Give me a little bit more time.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.300]   Give me a little bit of your knowledge."
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.740]   People are doing to King Solomon what people do in our day.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.860]   They hold blog posts and they interview people.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.860]   They have YouTube channels.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.460]   They're like, "Let's interview King Solomon."
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.700]   They go over there and like, "What did you do here?
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.520]   What laws did you enact?
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   How did you get so wealthy?
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.700]   How did you get so wise?"
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.340]   King Solomon is going to turn to them and say, "Your pursuit of reproducing this kingdom
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.300]   honor, vanity of vanities.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.780]   All is vanity."
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:39.420]   You see what you realize when you're playing that game, you're simply delaying the inevitable.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.860]   He's going to be the first person out, but I feel so bad.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.100]   I just want to like give him some of my houses and give him some of my money.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.220]   What does that do but build false hope?
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.220]   Monopoly is wicked.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   Okay, that's my point.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   I'm just kidding.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.740]   You can still play.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.060]   We ended up not finishing the game.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:59.580]   Now moving on to the spiritual application.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.900]   I am a parent thinking regularly about, "Oh my goodness, what world am I going to bring
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.060]   my kids into?
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.460]   What life are they going to have in America now that the country is so divided?
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.620]   That people are lovers of themselves?
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:17.980]   That there's so much subjectivity and nobody even knows right from left?
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.980]   But then do I teach them?
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.900]   "But you son, you have potential.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.900]   You have value.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.900]   You have worth.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.420]   You can do it.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.420]   Put in your time.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.420]   Put in your energy.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   Sacrifice your friends.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.420]   Sacrifice this and that so that you can succeed.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.500]   Is that what I'm going to teach them?"
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:38.540]   Only to have them return to me later and say, "But dad, I thought I was going to be happy
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.420]   after having sacrificed all this stuff.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.420]   Is that what's going to happen?"
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:49.460]   No, I'm going to teach them the realities that King Solomon is going to teach them.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.420]   Sons, hard truth.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:56.860]   You're entering into a corrupt world that already stands condemned.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.140]   You need to look to God.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.940]   You can't look in.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.940]   You can't look out.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.900]   You need to look to God.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.720]   So I want to take this opportunity to introduce you the third way that you can respond when
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.460]   you see what King Solomon sees.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.060]   When you see the hopelessness, the helplessness, and the pointlessness, you can just hate life
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.060]   and be like, "You know what?
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.060]   I'm out.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.660]   I don't want to live here anymore."
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.060]   You can lie and be like, "You know what?
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060]   Let's make lemonade."
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.220]   Or you can look to God who will tell you like it is.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.540]   God has already told you, brothers and sisters, listen to Him.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.020]   As an exhortation to you, you need to listen and harken your ears.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:43.260]   You need to call upon the Lord and hear His wisdom.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.200]   God has already told you that this generation is wicked and perverse and the axe is already
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.780]   there at the base.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.180]   This world is ripe for judgment and it's going to get worse.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:04.100]   What's more, our Lord Jesus already said that His kingdom is not of this world.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.700]   Let's take a moment to thank God.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.200]   Amen?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.980]   If we believe all that King Solomon believed without God in our lives, we are only left
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   to our devices.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:22.620]   You don't need all of King Solomon wisdom to see that because already there are case
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:30.260]   examples of people who have been rich, wealthy, famous, who hate their lives but it's so unsatisfactory,
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.320]   so disappointing.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.820]   Hear King Solomon's exhortation to us.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.700]   Turn in your Bibles to Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1 through 7.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.140]   Brothers and sisters, hear it.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.500]   Hear His wisdom.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.820]   He spent 11 chapters in the book of Ecclesiastes showing you that there is no hope in this
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.900]   world including in you.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:58.860]   But He says to you, Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1, "Remember your Creator.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.860]   In the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near, when you
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.100]   will say, 'I have no delight in them,' before the sun and the light and the moons
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:15.400]   of the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain, remember your Maker.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.780]   Consider God.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.780]   Look to Him."
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:24.400]   I can't read that whole section because of time but it's so beautiful and poetic how
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.820]   He describes to us, "You have but a short life on this earth while you have a moment."
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.220]   Listen to God.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.300]   If anybody's sitting here telling you, "No, no, no.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.340]   You got to play this game," let them know this is all monopoly.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.140]   King Solomon was on the top of the world.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.180]   He was the king with power, resources, and he had all the pleasure in the world.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.980]   And he looked up and realized, "Oh my goodness, we're just playing a game.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.660]   You're taking turns rolling the dice and by chance we're landing on spaces.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.520]   But at the end of the day, I got to turn all this in because all of us, we're going back
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.620]   in the box.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.260]   We're all going back in the box."
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.740]   What does he do?
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:09.220]   He points up and says, "You need to listen to God.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.220]   Thanks be to God."
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.140]   What he says is first and foremost, "Yes, this world is condemned."
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:19.440]   But secondly he says, "I have a better plan for you."
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.140]   You may ask of kings, "What's your plan for our country?"
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.480]   You may ask of politicians, "What's your plan for us?
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.260]   What's your plan for your term?"
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.220]   You may look to family, friends.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:36.820]   You may even look to this church asking them, "What's your plan to lead me, to guide me?"
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:42.300]   Brothers and sisters, we are of those who believe our Lord and His kingdom.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.700]   He has a better plan for us.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.900]   Amen?
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.460]   Turn your Bibles now over to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:55.460]   As you guys know, chapter 11 is a chapter on the great hall of faith.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:01.740]   All men who have walked this world with courage made incredible sacrifice that astounds us.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.260]   Listen to what it says of them.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.060]   Hebrews chapter 11 verse 39.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.860]   Take a moment to get there in your scripture.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.820]   And he says, "These, these faithful ones were all commended for their faith, yet none of
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.780]   them received what had been promised since.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:24.240]   God had planned something better for us so that you, sorry, that only together with us
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.740]   would they be made perfect."
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:33.140]   Brothers and sisters, let that soak in for a little bit.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:40.340]   God has something incredibly planned in His kingdom that's so much far above and beyond.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.100]   And we could take days to meditate upon how much greater it is for us to have Him as our
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:51.460]   King, the righteous one who has perfect justice, perfect knowledge, perfect power to enact
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.700]   for us His justice.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:58.720]   We could sit here and meditate on this idea that God not only has this desire to make
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.860]   for us the better kingdom, but He's going to make you perfect.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.940]   He's not going to just make sure that there are laws to guide you.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.820]   He's going to make sure that you're blameless.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.100]   You no longer will have pride.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.380]   You no longer will have greed in here.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.920]   You no longer will have selfishness.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.760]   This is the kind of kingdom to which we are hoping in.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.820]   This is to us the eternity that we're going to have.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.820]   And the challenge for us then is to make sure we're thinking on this level.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.300]   And so I want to give some final exhortations to you.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.000]   Final exhortation first being that make sure that you're not evaluating this world according
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.600]   to the flesh.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.100]   Make sure you're not seeing things according to this world, but rather you're seeing things
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.420]   in the Spirit.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.860]   You're seeing things according to the eternal perspective through what God has given you
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.740]   as the value of eternity in heaven.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.100]   You are putting in its appropriate place everything from your fears to your setbacks and including
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.140]   your successes.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:08.620]   Imagine with me if this world and this generation right now in this moment, this day was different
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.540]   and we had so many things going for us.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.540]   There was low crime.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.180]   There was low unemployment.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.880]   You guys were being successful.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.980]   You were living life with all the accomplishments in your world.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:24.740]   What do you think King Solomon would say to you?
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:29.320]   Still vanity compared to eternity, right?
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.140]   Still empty compared to what God has in store.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.020]   God has better plan for us.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:40.580]   And so in our day when we talk, in our day when we speak, because right now there are
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.140]   so many people with so many opinions.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.680]   And I for one are one of those people who's been contributing to that.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.300]   You know online people are typing and people are saying this of that opinion.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.300]   We have social commentators.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.860]   We have social influencers.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.940]   We have political, you know, anchors and this and that.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.380]   I'm journalist.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.820]   Everybody has an opinion, you know.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:11.060]   But for us, make sure, let us make sure that we are speaking in the wisdom of King Solomon.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.060]   Let us make sure that we're speaking with the eternal perspective.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.800]   If you turn your Bibles, we're already there in Hebrews 11.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.700]   Not Ecclesiastes, but Hebrews 11 verse 13.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:29.360]   Continuing on with the reflection about those who've been faithful in the old.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.620]   Of them it says, all these people were still living by faith when they died.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.960]   They did not receive the things promised.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   They only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.260]   and strangers on earth.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:49.860]   People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.280]   If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.620]   to return.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.880]   But instead they were longing for a better country, a heavenly, heavenly one.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.260]   Therefore God is not ashamed to call, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.260]   for them.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.720]   Brothers and sisters, as an exhortation to you, is it pretty clear you're looking for
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.780]   a better country?
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.220]   Is it pretty clear when you're frustrated and you have angst and you're looking at all
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.700]   the woes of the generation and you're counting all the injustices and you're like, "Oh my
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.700]   goodness!"
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:29.300]   Is it really clear that you're not just simply trying to defend your home here, but is it
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.060]   evidently clear you're a stranger?
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.980]   And is it evidently clear you're looking for God's better plan?
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:43.180]   For to us, our citizenship is in heaven, from which we eagerly await for the Savior, the
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.180]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.180]   Amen?
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:53.260]   Let's take a moment to bow and pray.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.980]   Lord God, we thank you so much.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:03.140]   Although the sermon had so much to do with how fallen this world is, and we know, you
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:09.380]   told us God, this whole world and all of creation groans in agony until redemption happens.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:17.180]   But Lord, we thank you that in light of all that, we recognize that we have a true, unwavering
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.260]   hope in Christ.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.120]   Thank you, Lord, for securing our future.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.420]   Thank you, God, in loving us in such a way where we can walk this world with confidence,
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:31.540]   even if all things were to fade and fall away, even if all our ambitions and desires are
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.300]   passing, we thank you, God, that you prepare a way for us.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.580]   And Lord, I pray then that we would live by such faith, that God, we would live by such
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.220]   eternal hope.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.220]   We thank you, Lord.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.220]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
