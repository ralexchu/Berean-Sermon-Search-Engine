[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   You can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 11.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.440]   And I'm going to read from verse 17 all the way down to verse 24.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.320]   But our main focus is going to be on verse 20 to 24.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.440]   Romans chapter 11, verse 17 through 24.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.600]   But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.800]   grafted in among the others, and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.720]   do not be arrogant toward the branches.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.960]   If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.640]   Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.640]   That is true.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.320]   They were broken off because of their unbelief.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.400]   But you stand fast through faith.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.920]   So do not become proud, but fear.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.800]   For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.920]   Note then the kindness and the severity of God, severity toward those who have fallen,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.320]   but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in His kindness.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.480]   Otherwise you too will be cut off.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.520]   And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160]   has the power to graft them in again.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.720]   For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted contrary to
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.320]   nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more would these, the natural branches, be
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.160]   grafted back into their own olive tree?
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.040]   Let's pray.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.000]   Abba Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320]   We thank you, Lord, for the privilege to call you our Father.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440]   We've come to honor you.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.520]   We've come to be fed.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.760]   We come to meet you, Father God, that knowing you are our refuge.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:02:03.720]   Many of us may be in the midst of entanglement, concerns.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:30.520]   But we are in the midst of your love.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:59.120]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:27.320]   We are in the midst of your love.

[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:40.040]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:06:03.240]   We are in the midst of your love.

[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:56.040]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   We are in the midst of your love.

[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   We are in the midst of your love.

[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   We are in the midst of your love.

[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   We are in the midst of your love.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.600]   I think the King James Version really captures better what this word particularly means.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.480]   In the King James, or I think maybe the New King James has the same word, it says "Behold."
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   I don't know if you guys use that casually in conversations now.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.000]   I've never heard it recently.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Like "Behold."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Right?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.560]   "Behold this beauty.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.920]   Behold this mountain."
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.600]   Nobody speaks like that today, so that's probably why it wasn't translated that way.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.360]   But I feel that the meaning behind this word, the word "Behold" captures it better.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.600]   Because it's not simply to look or to think or to listen, but to take time to really deeply
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.920]   consider.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.360]   So that word is used in the Bible in that kind of reference more than a thousand different
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.440]   times.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.640]   About twelve hundred, and depending on some translation, maybe a little bit more than
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:19.680]   twelve hundred times, where God constantly says, "Take time to consider, to look, to
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.720]   study, to meditate, to think upon these things."
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.780]   Because it has serious consequences.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:37.120]   So after describing His mercy toward the nation of Israel, He now says, "But be careful."
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.880]   Because just the way that He judged the nation of Israel, you will also be judged if you
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:47.400]   do not continue in His kindness.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.720]   Kindness and the severity of God are intertwined.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   We kind of tend to dichotomize, saying, "Well, we see the kindness of God, the severity of
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.480]   God."
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   It is not to be taken separately.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   In fact, Exodus chapter 34, verse 6 through 7, God says, "The Lord passed before him and
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.960]   proclaimed, 'The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.760]   steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.040]   transgressions and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.120]   of the fathers on their children, the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.'"
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.880]   You notice how He begins the introduction by saying He is gracious, He is slow to anger,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.680]   abounding steadfast love, but in the same breath, He reminds them, "But He will by no
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.000]   means just sweep sin underneath the rug."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.800]   The cross of Jesus Christ does not make sense.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.960]   If you do not understand the severity of God, if you do not understand the holiness of God,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:59.560]   the gravity of sin and gravity of who God is, the cross just does not make sense.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.240]   I've shared the gospel with people, and people, you know, one of the common objections that
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.280]   they have is, "Why go through all that drama of the Son of God living a holy life and being
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280]   crucified?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.320]   Why doesn't God just say, 'I forgive you'?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320]   I mean, I do that.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.040]   If somebody sins against me, I don't cut myself and bleed and send my only son to be beaten
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   up, you know.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.600]   I just say, 'You're forgiven.'
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.480]   Why doesn't God just say, 'You're forgiven'?
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.400]   What all that drama for?
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.240]   If you don't understand the severity of God and the holiness of God, the cross does not
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.880]   make sense.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.040]   Romans chapter 2, 4 through 6, he says, "Do you presume on the riches of the kindness
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.400]   and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.120]   repentance?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.240]   But because of your hard-hearted and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.460]   on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgments will be revealed.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.080]   He will render to each one according to his work."
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.600]   Do you see in that very short passage, verse 4, 5, and 6, how the severity of God and the
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.360]   kindness of God are vitally intertwined with one another?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.560]   It's not one over the other, but it is both.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.520]   And every time God is revealed, whether it is in the gospel or the way he deals with
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   the nation of Israel or even the way he deals with the church, it is both.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:27.400]   As much as it makes us uncomfortable to consider and meditate and think upon the judgment of
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:33.360]   God, we'd rather talk about his grace and no matter what you did this week, God loves
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.280]   you unconditionally and we are uplifted and encouraged by that, and it may make us feel
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.080]   uncomfortable to think that there are consequences to our sin.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.960]   And we can easily just write that off as legalistic.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   That's not what God wants.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.760]   God wants us to feel lifted and encouraged.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.420]   In fact, I hear more and more churches advertising that if you come to our church, you're going
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.320]   to feel uplifted and encouraged.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.400]   Now I don't know exactly what that means.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.880]   Maybe they mean that the truth is going to encourage them, that they're going to be pierced
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.080]   in their heart and it's going to bring them to repentance and that's going to uplift them.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.440]   Maybe that's what they mean.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.200]   But just by the language in itself, it's a false advertisement because not all of Scripture
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.280]   causes us to feel uplifted.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:25.720]   In fact, much of Scripture brings much weight, seriousness if we're walking away from God,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.080]   a warning of judgment.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.560]   When we think of grace and mercy, I don't think we can think of any better example than
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.520]   Jesus himself, who voluntarily gave himself to demonstrate the love of God to sinners
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.320]   who are blasphemous and was crucified voluntarily in order to die for very people who hated
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.320]   him.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.880]   So when we think of grace, there's no better example than Jesus Christ himself.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:01.520]   Nobody gave the harshest example, nobody gave the most difficult description of God's judgment
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   than Jesus himself.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.040]   In Matthew 8.12, he says, he describes hell as a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.960]   In Mark chapter 9.48, he says, "Their worms shall not die."
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.040]   Matthew 3.12 and Mark 9.43, that hell will be unquenchable fire.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.640]   Matthew 25.41, eternal fire.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.840]   Matthew 18.9, the hell of fire.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.320]   Matthew 25.46, eternal punishment.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.080]   Luke 16.24, anguish in flame.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:36.560]   I've only given you small snippets of the things that Jesus said, but Jesus speaks more
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   of God's judgment than he does about grace and salvation.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.600]   To emphasize one without the other, you end up completely missing the gospel.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.400]   You end up completely missing God himself.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.280]   Part of the reason why I believe that there's such superficiousness in our walk with God
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.440]   is because we have emphasized the kindness without understanding the severity.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.720]   We've looked and examined carefully of God's kindness and grace, but we haven't looked
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   carefully.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.380]   I think most Christians at churches know of hell.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.840]   Most of us have heard of it.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.880]   We've mentioned it, but almost always it's skimmed over.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   Even in the way that we share the gospel with non-Christians, it's like there's judgment
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.960]   coming, but there's grace.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.120]   So we spend 90% of our conversations about how God forgives our sins, but very little
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.120]   understanding of the judgment that's coming.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:40.640]   See, the mistake of having kindness without understanding severity leads us to the false
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   gospel.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   Do you remember when we were studying Revelation chapter 13, we were introduced to the red
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.600]   dragon, the Antichrist, and remember third, the second beast?
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   Who was the second beast?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.480]   Those of you guys in Bible study.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.880]   Dragon is Satan.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.840]   The first beast is the Antichrist, and the third, the false prophet, right?
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:11.360]   Remember Satan or devil, his primary task, right, his goal is to usurp glory from God.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.680]   But his primary task, his name basically means accuser.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.240]   They describe him as the one who accuses the brethren before God.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.080]   So if you have any guilt in you, if you have any sin, he's the one who prosecutes before
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.480]   God and says, "He does not deserve your love.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.720]   He needs to be punished.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.280]   Death must reign in this life."
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   That's Satan.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.340]   He's the accuser.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.360]   If you have severity without the kindness of God, that's all you get.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:46.320]   Satan has complete reign over your life, and when he accuses you, you have no remedy.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:53.000]   And so there are a few people that I have met in a few instances, and I think when I
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.200]   went to Romania, that's kind of like what I felt.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.240]   There was so much emphasis on judgment of God, there was no joy in the church.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.760]   There's people living in constant fear, and every once in a while, I'll have a conversation
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.840]   with somebody knocking on the door, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and every once in a while, I'll
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.920]   meet somebody who's really convicted and want to share with me, but most of the time, you
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.160]   can see in their eyes and the conversation we have that this is something they need to
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   do.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.200]   Because if they don't do enough of it, they're not going to go to heaven.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.320]   If they don't live right, if their good works don't add up to a certain point, they're not
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   going to get to heaven.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.040]   So they're constantly living in fear.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.240]   They're not allowed to have assurance of salvation.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.400]   Same thing with the Muslims.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.140]   They can't tell you that when they die, they're going to go to paradise.
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.400]   The only way to guarantee that they're going to go to paradise is to commit suicide through
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.120]   jihad.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:51.240]   You see why so many young men, and even women, and even children, are willing to strap themselves
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.000]   and blow themselves up, instead of living their whole life trying to be good, and then
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.360]   at the end of their life, not know if they're going to make it to paradise or not.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.200]   You go and blow yourself up, instant.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:09.720]   When you have severity without the kindness of God, you have satanic rule.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.120]   But on the other end, when you have the kindness of God without the severity of God, you have
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.400]   what the false prophets are.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.920]   Remember what the false prophets, their main work was?
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.600]   Is to deceive.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.200]   Deceive to bring attention to glorify the Antichrist.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.400]   And their primary work is to bring awe.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.960]   And it's not to bring fear, but to take away any fear that you have.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.720]   And if you look at the Old Testament, the prophets come, and you had Isaiah, Ezekiel,
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.760]   Amos, Hosea, coming and warning that judgment is going to come.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.200]   The Syrians, the Babylonians, they're going to come and take you into captivity because
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.440]   you did not obey the law of God.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.600]   And these false prophets would come, "No, they're liars.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.800]   Why would God be angry with us?"
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.960]   He said, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace."
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.360]   And that was the primary work of the prophets, the false prophets.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.540]   Constantly giving assurance, and he is not shaking their fist to get to God.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.120]   He is attracting them with the lure of the world.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.780]   And he's constantly telling lies.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.680]   And making people feel comfortable, and just kind of gradually drifting toward the things
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.520]   of God, or not of God.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.000]   Either way, whether you have severity without kindness, or kindness without severity, you
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   will miss God.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.920]   That is not the gospel itself.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.320]   See, number two, the fruit of God's severity is twofold.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   And I'm going to spend the rest of the time talking about these two things.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.400]   The fruit of this severity of God is twofold.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.040]   Why is it important?
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.600]   Other than the fact that that is exactly the way God has presented the truth to us.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.640]   Number one, the severity of God keeps us humble and in awe and fear of God.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   Look at verse 20.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.680]   He says, "This is true, that the branches were broken off so that I might be grafted
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   in.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   That is true.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.560]   They were broken off because of their unbelief.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   But you stand fast through faith, so do not become proud."
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:12.440]   In other words, they were broken off because of their unbelief, and if you continue, if
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.960]   you somehow do the same thing that they did, you will also be broken off.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:24.600]   So do not, do not be arrogant, but be in awe and fear of God.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.180]   When you look at the Old Testament, the way that God introduces himself to the nation
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:34.240]   of Israel is not the kind of picture that you and I would see.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.120]   You know, when I was younger, I had a picture of Jesus when he comes, and I imagined, right?
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.200]   Because, you know, I was taught and I knew that Jesus was central to my faith, and so
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.840]   we talked a lot about his second coming and praying for his second coming, and so I imagined
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.080]   what it would be like when Jesus came.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.600]   And the picture that I had in my head, and again, I was a young believer at that time,
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.800]   a picture I had of Jesus that I had was like my grandmother, you know?
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   My grandmother, I don't say my grandfather because I didn't know my grandfathers that
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.120]   well, but I have a very distinct picture of my grandmother.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.540]   You know, she always had candy in her pocket, you know?
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.920]   She always had something, and she would never let us leave her house without something given
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.800]   us, whether it was some money, you know, or candy.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.200]   So I loved going to my grandparents' house.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.540]   You know, you can mess up and do whatever you want, and you know, my parents are angry
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.200]   and they want to discipline us, and you run to grandma, and grandma will protect you.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.040]   Because I could tell grandma had more authority than my parents, right?
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.120]   That's the kind of picture I had of Jesus.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.400]   Like when I die, I'm going to run to Jesus, and he's going to hug me, and maybe candy,
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.800]   I don't know what he has in his pocket, but he's going to give me something, and I'm just
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.760]   going to just absorb his presence.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.160]   And that's kind of like the picture I had of Christ.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.040]   As a youth pastor, I remember I was going through the various attributes of God and
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.720]   landed on God's holiness.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.200]   And so I just started studying.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.880]   It's not like I haven't heard it before, but I really started just studying, and just going
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.440]   through this topic of holiness all through Genesis and Revelations.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.880]   And in the middle of the study, I realized there was an aspect of God that I completely
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.920]   did not understand.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.960]   I knew it, but I didn't look into it.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.360]   I wasn't beholding it.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.840]   If you asked me, I could have told you, "Of course God is holy, holy, holy."
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   I heard it before.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.520]   I was a Bible major undergrad.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.360]   I went to seminary.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:37.380]   But I didn't fully grasp, it didn't really hit me of what that meant.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:44.360]   The gravity of who He is and how everything else that I understand about God, it stems
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.720]   from the foundation of His holiness.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.320]   And even now, as I'm explaining this, there's no way I'm going to do it justice.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.440]   Because I've heard all of this before until, again, as a youth pastor, I was preparing
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.020]   a sermon, and it really, really rocked me.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.320]   And I could tell you that ever since then, my view of Scripture, my view of God was never
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.920]   the same.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:14.540]   If you remember when Moses encounters God for the very first time at the burning bush,
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.800]   his introduction to Moses wasn't, "I love you, and I heard your cry, so I'm going to
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.280]   come and I'm going to be merciful."
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.420]   The first thing he says to Moses, "Take off your sandals.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.180]   You're standing on holy ground."
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.500]   He tells Moses to have respect and awe in His presence.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.940]   That's the first introduction.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.340]   And when he says, "If I go and tell them they asked me, 'Who sent me?'"
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.460]   He says, "Tell them I AM has sent you."
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.500]   Now in and of itself, it doesn't mean anything.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.700]   But when you understand the meaning behind it, that God, there is no beginning, there's
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.860]   no end, He is.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.700]   It illustrates His power, self-existence.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:00.420]   In the word "I AM," it encapsulates His very essence of who He is.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.420]   He's self-existing.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:06.700]   So, He is powerful, holy, holy, holy.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.380]   Now we understand, you know, the reason why everybody is so nervous right now because
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.020]   North Korea may have a nuclear bomb.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.980]   And we're not as scared of Kim Jong-un.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.140]   We're not afraid of North Korean army.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.140]   We're afraid that possibly that nuclear bomb may go off somewhere near where we are.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.500]   We have a nuclear plant that's not too far from here.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   I mean, that, we should be more scared of that.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.940]   Remember when the earthquake hit in Japan and the devastation that they experienced?
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.420]   And even to this day, they haven't fully cleaned that thing up?
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.980]   We have a nuclear plant down here.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:48.420]   And so it makes people nervous, not simply because it's evil, but because the power it
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.940]   contains.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.360]   If some of that leaks out, we could die.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.500]   And the idea of being around something that powerful makes us nervous, fearful.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.660]   If you're on a boat and you see clouds beginning to form and you're in the middle of nowhere,
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.520]   you don't automatically think, "Yes, rain, water."
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   You don't think that.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.820]   The first thing you think is, "Oh my gosh, if this comes down and it begins to swell
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.320]   up and these waves come, we might die."
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.640]   Our first reaction, just like the disciples when the storm came, they were nervous.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.540]   And these are professional fishermen.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.900]   They were fearful.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:35.460]   See, when God introduces Himself and He says, "Take off your sandals for you are standing
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:44.020]   on holy ground," and He says, "I am," in His very name, an introduction Himself, would
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.780]   have produced fear.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:53.500]   That's exactly how God deliberately introduced Himself to the nation of Israel.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:30:01.420]   In fact, in Leviticus chapter 10, the first two priests who represents the nation of Israel
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:08.060]   are consumed with fire because they didn't follow the instructions exactly.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.020]   These are not idol worshippers.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.780]   They weren't blasphemers.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.900]   They were Moses' nephews, Aaron's sons.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:23.900]   The first two priests, in the context of serving God, are consumed by fire and God says to
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.300]   people who come, to my people, "I will show myself as holy."
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.260]   What do you think that did to the nation of Israel?
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.940]   What do you think that did to the nation of Israel?
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:41.660]   They hear that the first two priests who approached God died.
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.740]   And these aren't just any people.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:53.780]   These are Moses' nephews, Aaron, the priest's children, set apart to do this work and they're
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.760]   consumed and die.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.700]   My guess is fear fell upon the nation of Israel.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.040]   Dread probably came upon the nation of Israel.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.640]   Who would volunteer to be priests if that's what's going to happen to them?
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.720]   Do you think that was by accident that God did that?
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:17.320]   Do you think when God consumed these two men by fire that He was concerned, "If I do this,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   what if they're going to be afraid of me and they're afraid to come to me?"
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.920]   Do you think God was concerned about that or do you think God did that purposely?
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.160]   We know the answer to that.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   That was God-ordained.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.920]   God did that purposely.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.200]   He introduced Himself as a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.460]   He introduced Himself to the nation of Israel in His severity.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.680]   That's what we see in the book of Genesis.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.960]   He says, "If you eat of this tree, you shall surely die."
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.480]   And what happens?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.960]   They die.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.520]   Their wickedness multiplies.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.680]   They gather together.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.820]   They build this tower and God is angry over their sin.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.040]   What happens?
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.080]   He destroys the tower.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.880]   These men come together and they're living in sin.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.200]   The sin begins to increase.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.880]   God becomes angry and He sends a flood and kills everybody except for the eight.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.000]   He is introduced to us all through the Scripture in His severity.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:23.600]   Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, the disciples, John, every single one of these men who were confronted
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:29.120]   with God's presence did not run to Him and embrace Him.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.760]   They fell on their face in fear.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:42.720]   The weightiness of the presence of God is clear through Scripture.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.560]   Now why is this so important?
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:57.520]   Part of the reason why there is a nonchalant attitude in our walk with God is because we
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:03.880]   understand the severity of God, but we are not beholding the severity of God.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.560]   Why our fellowship is so casual, why people can say, "You know, I committed to Jesus,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.120]   but I'm not committed to His church."
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:15.040]   And when the Scripture clearly says, "You can't love God and hate your brothers.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.800]   The church is the body of Christ."
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.080]   Why we kind of pick and choose, "I love this doctrine, but I don't love that doctrine.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.120]   I love this about Jesus, but I don't love that about Jesus."
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:31.500]   For all of Scripture, all of who He is, the whole of the cross is God revealed.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:40.660]   So everything that we know about who He is is founded upon knowing His severity.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.620]   If we don't understand the weightiness of God's presence, the cross would never make
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.160]   any sense.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.640]   And this is why hell is so difficult for our generation, because we have a sense of
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:01.080]   justice based upon what we think is right or wrong, never really understanding God,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.920]   never really gazing upon and fully beholding His severity.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:14.400]   So we function under the assumption that God should be gracious to us.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.840]   He should be gracious to us.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.840]   He's God.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   He's supposed to.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.640]   And as a result of that, the weightiness of our sin, the weightiness of salvation is
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.760]   shallow.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.920]   But the second reason why the severity of God is so important for us is that severity
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.440]   of God propels us ultimately to the kindness of God.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.660]   There is a purpose for this other than just to reveal that this is who He is.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.800]   In 21 and 22 it says, "For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.040]   spare you.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.440]   Note then the kindness and the severity of God.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.240]   Severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.240]   in His kindness.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.080]   Otherwise, you too will be cut off."
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:03.160]   He says the whole purpose of this revelation is that fear of God will propel us to the
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.240]   kindness of God.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   Let me say that again.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.760]   It is the fear of God that propels us to the kindness of God.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.600]   In Matthew 10, 28-33 it says, "And do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   the soul.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:23.040]   Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.480]   How does he say to combat fear?
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   He said, "Combat fear with a greater fear of God.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.280]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny, and not one of them will fall to the ground and
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.960]   apart from your father?
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.800]   But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.400]   Fear not; therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.560]   So, everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   is in heaven.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.440]   But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.640]   You see how the fear of God, the severity of God, and the kindness of God are so intertwined
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.400]   in what he says here?
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.440]   He doesn't just across the board, "Hey, you know, if you sin, God loves you, and you don't
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   need to fear."
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.800]   He says, "No, do not fear them, but fear me."
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.040]   How do we combat fear?
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.840]   I mean, so much of the decisions that we make in life is because of some kind of fear.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.160]   I remember when I was a, when I first went to Magic Mountain, again, I think I forget
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.200]   if I was in junior high school or high school, I don't really like roller coasters, you know.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.240]   I tell people because it gives me a headache, but the reality is I don't like the feeling
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.760]   of dying, you know what I mean?
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.080]   So some of you guys like it, but I don't like it.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.200]   And so when I was in high school, you know, they would like, my friends would always want
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.880]   to go, and so we'd go, mainly because I don't want to be called the worst, you know what
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.880]   I mean?
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.720]   So I'm afraid what they're going to think if I don't go, because I've always, you know,
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.560]   like, they always, ever since I was young, they always said that I have too much testosterone,
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.040]   and I'm like, I'm a guy, you know, and so, like, they just don't think, like, "Oh, Peter's
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.440]   going to be afraid of roller coaster."
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.760]   Inwardly, I don't like it, you know.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.200]   I want to live.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.480]   So I go, but I never tell anybody.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:15.320]   I don't like being on roller coasters, but I would get on it anyway, you know?
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:20.640]   And at the end of the day, like, I'm the happiest guy, because I did it, and nobody found out.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.280]   I'm telling, publicly telling you now, but, you know.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.120]   And then I became a youth pastor, and sure enough, every year, somebody has a bright
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.280]   idea we have to go to Magic Mountain, and so we would go to Magic Mountain, and it just
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.720]   happens my wife likes roller coasters, so, you know, I can't be a wuss in front of her,
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   right?
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.840]   So I'm going to lose my authority in the home.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:49.320]   So, you know, I went, and I did what I needed to do, but inwardly, I never like roller coasters,
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.400]   right?
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.680]   And fear of man, what my friends would think, what my youth group kids would think, and
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   what my wife would think, you know, I kept that all bottled up until today.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.560]   You know, I kept that all bottled up, and I made sure nobody found out, but, you know,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.320]   there's a lot of things that, because of fear of man.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.160]   You dress a certain way, you speak a certain way, you do certain things because of fear
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.560]   of man, right?
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:22.120]   How much of our life is driven by fear of what will they think if I don't have this?
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.200]   What will they think if I don't go to this school?
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.280]   What will they think if I don't make this kind of money?
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.680]   How much of our temptation toward the world is driven by fear, some kind of fear?
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.240]   Maybe not fear of man, but fear of something else.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.520]   See, the severity of God propels us.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.900]   It overcomes all other fears.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.800]   He says, if you want to conquer the fear of man, don't fear these people.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.840]   He says, fear God.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.980]   Fear God who has control over your flesh and your soul.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:39:04.080]   And to conquer fear, because there's a greater God, and it gives us courage to live in obedience,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.600]   because it conquers all the other fears.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.080]   In verse 23, it says, even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.120]   in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.200]   For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.640]   nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.080]   grafted back into their own olive tree?
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:30.440]   He said, consider the severity of God, because the severity of God pushes you toward the
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.280]   kindness of God.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.480]   We cling to the kindness of God, not because we fear the world.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:48.160]   The Scripture tells us primarily we were saved from God, not from Satan, not from this bad
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.400]   world.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:55.240]   The wrath of God was raining upon mankind, so when He came, He consumed wrath.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:02.460]   Jesus consumed wrath upon Himself to save us from God's wrath.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.800]   The severity of God, beholding the severity of God, ultimately propels us to cling to
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.000]   the kindness of God.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.280]   That's why Philippians 2.12, it says, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.640]   In a generation where we've only been told that the kindness of God, that verse doesn't
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.160]   make a lot of sense.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.680]   We kind of read it, don't have an answer for it, so we just kind of swing, you know, pass
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.120]   by, but we don't know what it means.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.920]   That's exactly what it means, to live out your Christian life with fear and trembling.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.060]   So when we see ourselves drifting away from God, there should be fear and trembling.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:48.120]   When we see ourselves compromising in sin, there should be fear and trembling.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:55.300]   When we see ourselves living in disobedience and drifting away from obedience, God desires
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:01.220]   us to have fear and trembling, to propel us to persevere in His kindness.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.780]   That's why Jesus says in Matthew 18.8, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin,
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.900]   cut it off and throw it away, it is better that you enter life maimed or lame than the
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:16.300]   two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal fire.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.660]   That's how severe He wants us to fear and tremble.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:27.300]   Not to live in fear of judgment, but that fear would push us toward the kindness of
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   God.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:33.380]   Hebrews chapter 12.4, He says, "In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.420]   the point of shedding your blood."
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.500]   How easily we compromise.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.500]   How easily we say, "Well, where do we draw the line?"
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.140]   And we use these broad terms to excuse all kinds of sin in our lives, and whenever we
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.140]   feel any kind of guilt, we say, "Well, that's legalism.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.180]   That's judgmentalism."
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:42:01.100]   And yet, the Scripture continues to tell us to live out with fear and trembling.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.340]   Let me conclude with reading this passage, because I believe Hebrews chapter 12.18-29
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.980]   will illustrate and summarize this passage well.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   So Hebrews chapter 12.18-29.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.660]   Okay.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.380]   Is all the verses here?
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.380]   There's a bottom portion of that.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:26.420]   Okay, there you go.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:33.940]   "For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and a darkness and gloom and
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:40.340]   a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.500]   no further message be spoken to them.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.300]   For they could not endure the order that was given.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.740]   If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.220]   Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, 'I tremble with fear.'"
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.940]   Let me stop right there.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.860]   He says, "We did not come to that mountain."
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.460]   This mountain he's talking about, it's not a satanic mountain.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.060]   This is a mountain where God gave the commandments.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.700]   God told Moses to come.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.940]   God told them to tremble.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.620]   Everything that Moses felt was what God made him feel.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:20.140]   The fear that Israel had when Moses came down just because of the glimpse of God's glory
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.420]   that was shining off of his face, they were terrified.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.020]   Asked him to veil his face and go into a tent.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.980]   That was all done by God.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.700]   The author says, "But we did not come to that mountain."
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.860]   That was the old covenant.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.420]   In verse 22, he says, "But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.620]   the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in the festal gatherings, and to the
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.540]   assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.980]   to the spirits of the righteous that made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:59.020]   covenant, and to the sprinkle of blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel."
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:05.300]   He says, "What they had in the old covenant was what Moses, Israel experienced, and that
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.060]   was the severity of God."
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:13.660]   Now if we stop with that only, Satan would have absolute control.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.780]   He would have absolute sovereign reign because he's the accuser of brothers.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.940]   And you have any sin in you, you're guilty under judgment of God, living in fear and
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   trembling.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.460]   But he said, "You did not come to that mountain.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.820]   We're of the new covenant."
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:31.700]   And he describes this new covenant in Mount Zion where we are free from our sins.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.380]   We have this festal gathering.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.380]   We're called children of God.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:40.220]   We have been made righteous, and we have been made perfect by the perfect mediator, Jesus
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   Christ.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.500]   So now if we stop in verse 24, he said, "Well, we're not under the old covenant, but we're
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500]   under the new covenant.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:52.940]   So therefore, we're no longer under condemnation, so we can live free."
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.400]   But that's the mistake.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.660]   So if we stop in verse 24, we don't understand the full impact of what he's saying.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.980]   And in order to understand the totality, you have to understand, you have to read the rest
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.460]   of it with Psalm verse 25.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.340]   He says, "See that you do not refuse him who is speaking."
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.900]   He's talking about present tense.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:17.540]   "If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:22.060]   we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.100]   At that time, his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised yet once more, 'I will
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.940]   shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.'"
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.340]   Those of you who've been studying through Revelation with us, you know exactly what
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.580]   we mean.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.900]   The judgment is going to shake all of creation.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.620]   This phrase, "yet once more," indicates a removal of things that are shaken, that is
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:46.780]   things that have been made in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:51.700]   "Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:57.580]   let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   fire."
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:05.540]   See, verse 18 to 21 is description of the old covenant.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.220]   Verse 22 through 24 is a description of our sins being taken away.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:15.980]   Verse 25 through 29 is the application of the gospel.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:22.220]   And the application of the gospel is, if God, who was severe in the old covenant, and yet
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:29.420]   we have been given this tremendous mercy, how much guiltier would we be for those who
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:37.320]   have been given so much to ignore and neglect and to simply trample on this salvation?
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:45.460]   So the application in the new covenant is that we would offer to God acceptable worship
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.600]   with reverence.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.680]   The word here is "all," but the word "all" is also translated in other translations to
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:58.000]   "fear," for our God is a consuming fire.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.980]   This is the God that we come to worship every Sunday.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:07.220]   Not grandma with candy in her pocket.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.340]   Not to say that God is not gentle.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.120]   Not to say that God is not loving and gracious.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.660]   All of that is true.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:21.140]   But if we pick and choose that these are the things that I like, and that we minimize the
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:29.000]   things that God has revealed about Himself, it does affect the way we live.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.260]   It does affect the way we see sin.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.460]   It affects the way we practice love.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.560]   It affects the way we practice church.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.800]   It affects the way that we see the world and how we live in this world.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.200]   It affects the way we think.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.020]   It affects the way we pursue things.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.200]   It affects our values.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.560]   It affects our hope.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.120]   And ultimately may affect our eternity.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:07.680]   Behold, look, see, examine, study, meditate on the kindness and the severity of God that
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.320]   we may persevere in His kindness.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.880]   Let's pray.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:22.940]   Again, we want to invite you to take some time to come before the Lord in prayer.
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:31.200]   Have we been walking casually, lukewarm in our hearts, but not sensing any urgency to
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.760]   change?
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:41.160]   Drifting, allowing bitterness and anger and hatred, not seeing the damage that it's doing
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:45.200]   in my heart?
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.160]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord in honest prayer as our worship team leads
