[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:23.740]   - Hi, good morning.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.740]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.740]   Those of you who are here physically
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.740]   and also those of you who are joining us online.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.740]   We made it past 2020, now we're in 2021 for service.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.740]   Okay.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.740]   We have a few things that we wanna,
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.740]   we want to address before we move on.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.740]   First of all, our seeds department that, you know,
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.740]   we were hoping to open up in January.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.740]   We're gonna have to hold off for a little bit.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.740]   Obviously you guys know what's going on.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   And most of our volunteers there are hospital workers.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   So we wanna be careful
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.740]   and they're not able to come help yet.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.740]   So most likely most of January,
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   we will probably be shut down for the seeds department.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.740]   The sprouts department will be open.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.740]   You know, the high school students,

[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.940]   and according to our fourfold vision,
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.940]   what are some areas that we need to be strengthened in.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.940]   And so this is the verse that we want to focus on,
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   "Watch and pray."
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   So you've probably seen our artwork.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.940]   And so that's going to be something that you're going to see.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.940]   And so I wanted to introduce that to you
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.940]   before I jump back into the book of Hebrews.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.940]   Reading 1 Peter 4, verse 7.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.940]   The end of all things is near.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.940]   Therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.940]   for the purpose of prayer. Let's pray.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.940]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your grace.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:21.940]   And we pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would open our eyes.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.940]   Convict us, Father God, that we may see your glory.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.940]   That we may have a greater and greater, a deepening appreciation
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.940]   and love for who you are.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.940]   That our whole life would simply be a reasonable response
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.940]   to what we profess to believe.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.940]   We thank you for your grace in 2020.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.940]   And we pray, Father God, that same grace would continue to guide
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.940]   and lead your church in 2021.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.940]   Lord, as we give our first fruits to you,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.940]   may it multiply, may it be something, Lord God,
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.940]   that you push our church toward
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.940]   and asking, Lord, for your help to do so.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.940]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.940]   So the theme for 2021 is Watch and Pray.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.940]   So prayer is our primary focus that we want to push in 2021.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.940]   Every year we look at our church,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.940]   we look at our strength, our weaknesses.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.940]   We take meetings, we take evaluation and say, you know,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.940]   these are things that we should focus on.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.940]   And obviously there's a lot of things that we can give our attention to.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.940]   But this is something that we've actually pushed
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.940]   and talked about for many years.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   And if you've been at our church for more than three, four years,
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.940]   you know probably this has been our theme going forward each year.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.940]   And so, but as we evaluate, we come again that this is something
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.940]   that we really need to give our attention to.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   Not just to talk about it, not just to give sermons about,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.940]   but to give attention to.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   You know, every person has a blind spot.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   You know, there's certain things that you're kind of aware of,
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.940]   but you don't realize how bad it is until you get married.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.940]   And then your wife or your husband will make sure you know, right?
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.940]   And so that's a benefit of being married in some sense.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.940]   And whenever you live in a community, right,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.940]   when you're a community, you have blind spots
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.940]   that you kind of get poked at.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.940]   And so if you're humble, you'll receive it.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.940]   If you're not, you'll fight back.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.940]   We have a blind spot in the Western church that we are aware of,
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.940]   but I don't think we know how serious it is.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.940]   If I came up here on Sunday, this morning, and I say,
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.940]   "You know what, I didn't have any time this week to prepare for my sermon.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.940]   I didn't get to read my Bible.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.940]   I'm just going to wing it.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.940]   I'm going to let the Holy Spirit speak this morning."
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.940]   Every other week it was me, but now I'm going to let the Holy Spirit speak, right?
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.940]   I think most of you, you know, who came to hear the Bible,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.940]   you're going to say, "What are you doing up there?"
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.940]   If you didn't prepare for the sermon, don't get up there and waste our time.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.940]   Just pray and get off.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.940]   Because we value the Word of God.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.940]   The Word of God needs to be exposited.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.940]   We need to have high priority in making sure that the Word of God is taught, preached.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.940]   And in order to do that, I need to prepare.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.940]   Yet in the Western church, including our church,
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.940]   if I said, "I didn't have time to pray.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.940]   I didn't spend much time in prayer.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.940]   I didn't think about it."
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.440]   They would say, "Yeah, it's understandable.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.440]   That's a discipline that we're weak in, and then we just move on."
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.440]   Prayer in Scripture is just as important a proper exposition of God's Word.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   In the Eastern church, you know, in the Asian churches,
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   they tend to be strong in prayer.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   Maybe weak in theology, but very strong in prayer.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   Their response would be exactly the opposite.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   The pastor came up and said, "You know, I didn't prepare,
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   and I didn't pray much, and I haven't been praying at all."
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.440]   You know, and they said, "What? What are you doing up there?
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   How can you be a pastor and be preaching a sermon if you're not praying?"
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   And in the same way, this blind spot in the Western church is not a small problem.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   I would say it is the problem in the church.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.440]   The Bible says, "You did not have because you did not pray."
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   Our typical response to whenever there's a problem is, "Let's get organized.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.440]   Let's have a meeting.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.440]   Let's see what theological things that we've missed.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.440]   Let's have a class. Let's train these people.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.440]   Let's do these things, and let's get to it.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   And let's do a good job."
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   And that's our typical response.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   And none of that is wrong.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   And there is a place for all of that.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   But if you know the scriptures as well as I do,
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.440]   which all of you know the scripture, and you've read it,
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.440]   the Bible places prayer just as high as value as the Word of God.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.440]   So that is a big blind spot in the Western church.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:55.440]   And part of the reason why we talk about the weakness of the church is probably that.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.440]   Without prayer, we automatically become anxious.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.440]   When things happen and things don't go according to plan,
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   we become anxious because we're not sure where God fits into all this
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   because we haven't been engaging with God.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   In fact, sometimes it's even worse when you are successful and things are at peace
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.440]   because we automatically think it must be because of something I'm doing.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.440]   So either we are prone to anxiousness,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.440]   or we're prone to pride, thinking that we know the answers.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   Either way, when we don't pray, it is detrimental.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:37.440]   Knowledge and experience without prayer causes us to rely on knowledge and experience.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.440]   If you think you have greater intellect,
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:47.440]   if you have more experience, maybe you're a bit more gifted.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   Without prayer, it automatically leads to self-glory.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.440]   It leads to pride.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.440]   Prayer is essential, not important, essential in our walk with God.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   Without it, we don't even know if we're right with God or not right with God.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.440]   So this is a glaring weakness in our church.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:17.440]   Every time we talk, we say, "This is something we need to deal with."
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.440]   This year, we're hoping that we would do more than just give you a verse or a sermon
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   and to encourage you to pray.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   We've tried to implement morning prayer, Friday night prayer.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.440]   We had praise and prayer implemented, but I think all of that is just a slight nudge.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   We want to do more than that.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.440]   We want to emphasize prayer to the extent that we emphasize the Word of God.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.440]   That may not happen overnight, but we want to make sure that we're headed there as a church
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   because I believe, and I think we all believe, that it is that important.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   It is a weakness in our church beyond anything else.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   1 Peter 4.7, the text that we want to focus on this morning.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   It says, "End of all things is near.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   Therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   I want to break this down into three parts.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   First, the motivation of prayer.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.440]   Why we should pray.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   Second, preparation for prayer.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   What is it that we are called to do.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   And then third, the power of prayer.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.440]   And that's the outline for this morning.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   The motivation for prayer is pretty simple.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.440]   It says, "The end of all things is near."
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   Peter wrote this 2,000 years ago.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.440]   If the motivation is that the end is coming, well, 2,000 years have passed,
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.440]   so how can we have any kind of urgency talking about something 2,000 years ago
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.940]   and say, "Well, end of all things is near."
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   Clearly it didn't end.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.940]   So how are you going to preach a sense of urgency in prayer
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.940]   when 2,000 years have passed and clearly things didn't end.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.940]   What does he mean by that and is this relevant to us today?
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.940]   Well, some people have thought that maybe the end that he is referring to
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.940]   is the physical death of the Christians, which was exactly what was going on.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.940]   1 Peter is written during the period when Nero's persecution was intense.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.940]   People were literally being torn apart by lions.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   They were being crucified on the cross publicly to shame them.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.940]   This is the period when the apostles are starting to get caught and beheaded
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   and one by one the church is being destroyed.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.940]   So some people thought that maybe what Peter is saying,
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:29.940]   the end, meaning physical end of Christians is near, so you better be ready.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.940]   Some people thought that maybe this is referring to the end of Israel,
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.940]   that the old covenant is ending,
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.940]   and so Israel, there is no place for them anymore, and so we know what happens.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.940]   This is written around 65 AD and in AD 70,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.940]   the Romans come in and completely abolish the nation of Israel.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.940]   They got sick and tired of their many rebellions and they came in,
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.940]   destroys the temple so that they can't worship,
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.940]   and Israel as a nation just disappears.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.940]   So they scatter all over, but as a nation they disappear.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   So some think that Peter saw this coming and saying,
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.940]   "The end of all things is near, so you better get ready."
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.940]   The word that is used here for end in Greek is telos,
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   where we get the original word is teleos.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.940]   I think I mentioned this to you before,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.940]   back in seminary this word was so significant
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   in our understanding of the New Testament
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   that I did a whole paper just on this particular word, teleos.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.940]   The word teleos is never used in the New Testament
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.940]   to refer to the chronological end of something.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.940]   That there is a beginning, there is a middle, and there is the end.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.940]   So it can't be referring to the nation of Israel
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.940]   where there was a beginning, there is a middle,
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   and now he is going to abolish the nation of Israel.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.940]   The word teleos doesn't mean that.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.940]   The word teleos basically means a completion
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.940]   or consummation of something.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.940]   So when the Bible says that the end is near,
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.940]   it's that God's intended purpose
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.940]   or what he was trying to accomplish
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.940]   is coming to an end.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.940]   He says in 1 John 2.18, "Children, it is the last hour."
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.940]   The last hour he is talking about
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.940]   is not the very last chronologically.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.940]   He is talking about the last period.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.940]   In God's salvation history,
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.940]   there is the last thing that God is preparing
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   and trying to get the church ready for.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.940]   He says, "It is here."
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.940]   And what he says, again, the end of all things is near.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   That's exactly what he is referring to.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   And that's why Peter is able to say,
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.940]   in 2 Peter 1, 3-4,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.940]   "Seeing that his divine power has granted to us
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.940]   everything pertaining to life and godliness
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.940]   through the true knowledge of him
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.940]   who called us by his own glory and excellence."
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.940]   He says, "Everything that you and I need
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.940]   for life of godliness, for our salvation,
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   for our sanctification, for our glorification
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.940]   has been given to us.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.940]   They are no longer waiting for something to happen.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.940]   The Jews were given the law,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.940]   but the law was not the end purpose of that.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.940]   The law was for the preparation of the coming of Christ
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.940]   so that they would see sin as utterly sinful.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.940]   But all of that is to bring Christ,
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.940]   and so in his death and resurrection,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.940]   he would complete what is necessary for salvation.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.940]   That's what he means.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.940]   So when he says, "The end of all things is near,"
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.940]   he is meaning that what God had ordained
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.940]   is about to be consummated.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.940]   That we are no longer waiting passively,
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.940]   hoping the Messiah would come and deliver us.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.940]   We're no longer waiting for the Holy Spirit
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.940]   to be indwelling in us to give us power
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.940]   so that we would become witnesses in Judea and Samaria
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.940]   in the remotest part of the world.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.940]   We're no longer waiting for the new covenant.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.940]   We're no longer waiting for the establishment
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.940]   of the church and the apostles,
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.940]   and we're no longer waiting for the word of God
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.940]   to be given explaining the mystery of the gospel.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.940]   He says, "All has been given to you that is necessary."
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   That's what he means by teleos, the end.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.940]   The end is here.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.940]   So the challenge that he's giving to them is not,
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.940]   "Life is hard, but you hold on to the hope of Christ,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.940]   and hopefully you hunker down,
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.940]   find a good cave somewhere,
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.940]   and just hold on to the word of God
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   and make it to the end."
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.940]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.440]   He's saying, "Just hold on to Christ."
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.440]   This is a battle call.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   And that's why Jesus says at the end of his ministry,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations."
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   He says, "I will build my church,
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   The statement there is not a defensive statement.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to build my church
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   so that you can gather together
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   when the world is falling apart."
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   He says, "When the world is falling apart,
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   you guys gather together, hunker down,
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.940]   and you're going to be in a bubble
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.940]   where the outside world is not going to be able to attack you."
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.940]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.940]   He says, "I will build my church,
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.940]   No matter what is happening outside,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.940]   they're not going to be able to prevail against the church.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.940]   So gear up.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.940]   So this is not a call to escape to Colorado.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.940]   I know there's a lot of temptation
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.940]   with all that is going on around us
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.940]   that we want to find a cave somewhere
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.940]   and just hunker down for a period.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.940]   He says, "No, the suffering is coming."
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.940]   He says, "What God has consummated at the end time,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.940]   the establishment of the church,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.940]   to take the gospel and be the light in the darkness."
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.940]   So the darker the world becomes,
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.940]   the greater necessity there is
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.940]   for the church to be in that darkness.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.940]   And that's what he means when all things is near.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.940]   In Romans 13, 11, it says,
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.940]   "Do this knowing the time that it is already the hour
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.940]   for you to awaken from sleep."
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.940]   That if you've been sleeping,
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.440]   if you've been just kind of wandering around in the darkness,
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.440]   he says, "It is time to be awakened."
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   And when he says to be awakened,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   he's not simply saying to be alert and open your eyes.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.440]   He's saying, "See the times."
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   Everything that you and I need for a life of godliness,
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   everything that you and I, to be the light to the world,
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   has been given to us.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   Now the ball's on our court.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   And that's what he means to gear up.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   Get out of your shelters.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   You don't need to wait.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.940]   Everything's been given to you.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.940]   Get out of your shelter and gather together.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.940]   And so he says, "So we need to pray."
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.940]   You know, because of the pandemic,
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.940]   one of the most common questions that I've been getting,
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.940]   outside of, "Is our church going to be open or closed?"
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.940]   That's probably the number one question.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.940]   The number two question is,
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.940]   "Do you think Jesus is coming?"
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.940]   And of course the answer is yes.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   Of course the Bible says he's coming.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.440]   The next question is, "When?"
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   Now if I tell you when, you shouldn't listen to me anymore.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   The Bible says I will not know the time or the hour.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   But we should be able to tell the signs of the time.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   And so whether he comes in our generation, next generation,
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   there is more awareness of something going on.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   In fact, more and more non-Christians are asking the question.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.440]   There must be something beyond this world.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.440]   Now the fear of death in this pandemic
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.440]   has caused people to be more aware
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.940]   of the finiteness of our life.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.940]   And so he's basically saying, "Gear up. Open your eyes.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:31.940]   Be ready. Because the end of all things is near."
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.940]   Persecution is going to increase,
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.940]   but the opportunity to share the gospel
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.940]   is also going to increase with the persecution.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.940]   And he's basically telling us our motivation to pray,
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.940]   to gear up for this spiritual battle that he called us to.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.940]   When we are not in battle mode,
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.940]   if we're constantly living in a state
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.940]   of seeking the most comfortable place for us,
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   then there's no need for prayer.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.940]   You know how to find jobs.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.940]   You know what to do to get good grades.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.940]   You know how to make money.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.940]   You know how to make friends.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   You know how to get organized.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.940]   You don't need Jesus for that.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.940]   Sometimes the way that we pray,
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.940]   we kind of sprinkle Jesus on everything that we do.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.440]   We sprinkle in Jesus' name, kind of like the Catholics.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.440]   I cringe every time I see somebody do that
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.440]   because they think that this has some sort of power.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.440]   But the thing is, the Protestants do the same,
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.440]   in Jesus' name.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   You attach Jesus' name, kind of like doing this.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   As long as I sprinkle Jesus on our fellowship,
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.440]   sprinkle Jesus on Bible studies,
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   sprinkle Jesus on this,
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   God is obligated to answer our prayers.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   So the kind of prayer that he's calling us to pray
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.440]   is a battle cry.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.440]   And that's why he tells us to gear up
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.940]   because the motivation is, get ready.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.940]   Because in the end times,
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.940]   God is going to establish the church
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.940]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   You know what that means?
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.940]   That the gates of Hades are going to try.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.940]   Gates of Hades is going to do its best
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.940]   to break down its walls and destroy the church.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.940]   But he says, because I will establish my church,
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.940]   they will not prevail against it.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   So he says, that's where the motivation is.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.940]   So if we're not aware of the times,
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.940]   if we're living our lives
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.440]   as comfortably as we can,
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.440]   making sure we have the best life that we can
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   during this life,
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   then again, not only is our perspective wrong,
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.440]   it will affect the day-to-day way
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   that we live our lives.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.440]   We're going to look for caves to hide in.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   We're going to go to only places where we are safe.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.440]   We can only share the gospel
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   if we are welcomed into that area.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   And we will constantly live our lives
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   based on the value that we have.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.440]   So that's one of the benefits
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   of persecution and hardship
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   because it forces us out of our comfort zone.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   And that's what he's speaking to.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.440]   He's speaking to a group of people
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.440]   whose lives have been torn upside down
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   because of the gospel.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   And he's saying, good, get ready.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   Get ready because the time has come.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.440]   The end has come.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   Motivation for prayer.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   Secondly, he says, to prepare.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.440]   If you're properly motivated
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   because the end of all things is near,
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.940]   you need to prepare for prayer
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   by being of sound judgment and of sober spirit.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.940]   Sound judgment in Greek is "sophroneo,"
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.940]   which literally means to be wise in thinking.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.940]   And that's what it means in Romans 12
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.940]   when he says, "Do not be conformed to the world,
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.940]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.940]   Renewing of your mind.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.940]   And that's where we are committed to the word of God
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.940]   to make sure that we have a biblical perspective.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.940]   That our opinions are not based upon
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.940]   what's happening around us politically,
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.940]   socially, economically.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.940]   If we're not in the word of God,
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.940]   we naturally are going to have a different perspective.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.940]   Where does your knowledge,
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.940]   where does your truth come from?
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.940]   But when he says,
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.940]   "Not to be conformed by the renewing of your mind,"
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.940]   some of us may think, you know,
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.940]   I've been studying the Bible for a long time.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.940]   I know this text.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.940]   I know the biblical principles.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.940]   I know the theology.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.440]   I know what the Bible says in the book of Hebrews.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   The word of God does what?
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   First and foremost,
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   judge the thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   If we pray,
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.440]   when somebody is studying the Bible
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.440]   without much prayer,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.440]   typically what happens is
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.440]   the word of God is used to judge
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.440]   the thoughts and intentions of others' hearts.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.440]   Because I know the Bible.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   It becomes a tool to weed out sin in our community.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.440]   It becomes a tool to weed out sin in other people's hearts.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   But we are completely unaware
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   of what's going on inside of us.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   So that's what happens
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   when you study the Bible without much prayer.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   In fact, I will say
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   it is dangerous to study the Bible without prayer.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.440]   It is dangerous to have right theology without prayer
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   because right theology
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   gives you self-righteousness to judge other people.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   The primary purpose of the word of God
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.440]   is to keep us sober.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.940]   Sober in judgment.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   You know, again, the benefit of
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.940]   hardship that we faced
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.940]   or some people faced in 2020.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.940]   And even prior to that,
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.940]   many of you have experienced hardship
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.940]   unrelated to the pandemic.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.940]   Just your family, economically,
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.940]   maybe something else happened.
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.940]   But there are times when God,
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.940]   when we are sober
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.940]   and in our right thinking,
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.940]   we recognize that what God is doing
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   in the hardships and the world that He's shaken up
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.940]   is actually the best thing that could have happened for us.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.940]   When we're not sober,
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.940]   our greatest concern is our safety.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.940]   When we're not sober,
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.940]   our greatest concern is making sure
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.940]   that we have our best life now.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.940]   But when we are sober, we recognize
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.940]   that we're going to live in eternity in Christ
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   whether you live 90 years
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.940]   or whether you live 50 years
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:11.440]   or 30 years.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   It is trivial in light of eternity.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.440]   So our greatest concern should not be
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.440]   that I'm going to be living a healthy life
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.440]   until I'm 90.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   But when we're not sober,
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   that becomes our primary concern.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   When we're not sober, the primary concern is
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.440]   do I have enough money to take care of my family?
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   Am I going to be able to buy this house?
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   Or am I going to be able to invest in this?
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.440]   Am I going to have enough for retirement?
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   In and of itself, there's nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   We should be wise.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.440]   That's what God has given us.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.440]   But from an eternal perspective,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   all of that stuff, according to Apostle Paul,
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.440]   is rubbish in light of knowing Christ.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   So when we're not sober,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   we're naturally given to worldly concerns.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   And so that's why he's saying
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.440]   the end of all things is near,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   so therefore be sober in your judgment
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.440]   so that what we are thinking,
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.440]   how we are feeling,
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   is being dictated by what we profess to believe
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   in eternity.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.940]   You know, it is the most,
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.940]   when we are the most frustrated,
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   when we long for eternity.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   And that's the best thing that can happen to Christians.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.940]   So God will allow you to feel frustrated
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:26.940]   because it shakes us up from our temporary safety.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.940]   People who can't gather together
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.940]   long for fellowship.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.940]   You know, one of the benefits of, you know,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.940]   when our church shut down for a period
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.940]   and people couldn't come, you know,
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.940]   one of the things that I kept on hearing
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.940]   is how much they loved the gathering of the church.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.940]   I didn't hear that before.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:46.940]   Not that it wasn't there, but it brought it out.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   I didn't realize how important fellowship was
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.940]   until it was taken away.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.940]   You ever see videos of people
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.940]   who don't have direct access
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.940]   or easy access to the written word of God?
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.940]   You ever see videos of that in remote parts,
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:02.940]   even some parts in China
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.940]   where they don't have the written word
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.940]   and it's just amazing how much they cherish
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.940]   the word of God because they didn't have access.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:14.940]   Part of the benefit of the persecution
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.940]   and the hardship that is here
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.940]   and that will continue to come
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.940]   is that it causes us to long for eternity.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.940]   That's what he means by being sober in our judgment.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.940]   That we should not be shaken back and forth
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.940]   by what's happening outside the world.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.940]   You know, the Bible says that that was going to happen.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.440]   We shouldn't be taken off guard by that
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.440]   because it's been here in the scriptures all along.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.440]   Sometimes God will allow certain things to happen.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.440]   When we are sober,
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.440]   when we are biblically sober,
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.440]   spiritually sober,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.440]   it causes a hungering and thirsting for righteousness
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.440]   that probably wasn't there before.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   And that's what he means,
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.440]   to be sober in judgment
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   and then to be sober in spirit.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.440]   In the King James Version, literally,
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.440]   to be sober minded and to watch,
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.440]   to look carefully.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.440]   The former emphasizes internal thinking and internal feeling.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.440]   The second part, the latter,
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.440]   is talking about clear judgment
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.440]   in the way that we live,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.440]   to be self-controlled.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   Ephesians 5.15, it says,
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   "Therefore be careful how you walk,
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   not as unwise men, but as wise."
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.440]   You know, remember Pastor Nate's sermon last week
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.440]   when he was giving a sermon about the ten virgins?
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.440]   The five wise and the five unwise?
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.440]   And he said that the difference between the wise and unwise
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   is preparedness and unpreparedness.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.440]   And preparedness and unpreparedness
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   is directly linked to what you value.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   If you value something, you prepare.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.440]   If you don't value it, you don't prepare.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   And the distinction between the virgins who are saved
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   and the virgins who are not saved
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.440]   is how they live their lives to prepare
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   for the coming of their master.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   And that's exactly what he is saying,
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.440]   "Be careful how you walk."
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   Is the way that we live our life
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.440]   consistent with the second coming of Christ?
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   Is it consistent with the gospel that we profess?
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:18.440]   You know, let me talk to our young families.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   When I say young families, I'm talking about all of us.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.440]   We're all part of that, right?
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   The danger when we're young,
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.440]   when we're starting to raise our children,
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   or even when they get older,
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.940]   is that raising our kids and protecting them,
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.940]   providing for them,
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.940]   becomes our greatest value in life.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.940]   It is important.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.940]   But it becomes the greatest value in life.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.940]   And we evaluate what is godly and ungodly
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:50.940]   based upon, "Am I taking good care of my kids?"
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:53.940]   Now, does the Bible teach that?
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.940]   Yes, there are times when the Bible says that
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.940]   in order to be an elder in the church,
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.940]   you have to manage your household well,
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.940]   not to aggravate your children.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.940]   There are many commands in the scripture
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.940]   telling us to be good fathers.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.940]   But at the same time, it also says
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.940]   he who loves his father and mother more than me
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.940]   is not worthy to be my disciple.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.940]   And so the Bible tells us both ends.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.940]   And so sometimes, living in Orange County,
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.940]   we think that providing what is physically
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.940]   best for our children
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.940]   is what it means to be godly.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.940]   We have to be careful that we do not get fooled.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.940]   And Satan often uses that
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.940]   to distract us from our primary pursuit
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.940]   of honoring and glorifying God.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.940]   And what is best for your children
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.940]   is what causes them to love Christ the most.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.940]   And it's not always the physical safety.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:53.940]   It's not always the best schools.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   It's not always teaching them
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.940]   what they need to know.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.940]   Do they love Christ?
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.940]   So when he says to live in such a way
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.940]   that we recognize that it is temporary,
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.940]   even if they go to the best schools,
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.940]   even if they get the best education,
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.940]   even if they get the best job,
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.940]   even if they have the best marriage,
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.940]   that is not our primary goal.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.940]   Our primary goal is
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.940]   are they also walking soberly with Christ?
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.940]   That's the difference between foolish
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.940]   and prudent living.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.440]   Are we preparing for what is coming?
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.440]   Or are we preparing for a better life here?
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.440]   But third and finally,
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   the motivation of prayer is clear.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   Preparation of prayer
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.440]   to live righteously,
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.440]   to be sober in thinking,
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.440]   to engage in the word of God,
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   to memorize it, to meditate it,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.440]   to apply it,
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   let it judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.440]   If I stop the sermon here,
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.440]   it may be good to say,
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   "Okay, I like a few things that he said.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:55.440]   We need to be righteous,
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.440]   we need to disciple people,
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.440]   we need to be able to do this and that."
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.440]   But you've missed the whole point.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   Because the conclusion of what he says here
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   is so that you can pray.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.440]   He says the reason why you need to be sober
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   is not simply so that you can walk around
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440]   and say, "I'm sober.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440]   I'm studying the word.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440]   I'm biblically sound.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440]   I have the right theology."
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440]   He says, "No.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440]   All of that has to happen for what?
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   So that you can pray.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   So that your prayer life will be effective."
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440]   So if you're studying the Bible,
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:24.940]   have the right theology,
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.940]   memorizing scripture,
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   even teaching other people about scripture,
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.940]   and yet we do not pray,
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.940]   you missed the whole point.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.940]   Because the power is not me and you
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.940]   in our discipline.
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.940]   The power is not in the training
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.940]   or in the organization.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:44.940]   The power isn't always in God.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.940]   You notice here in 1 Peter 3, 7,
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.940]   and I'm going to give you a warning ahead of time.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.940]   If you have any feminism in you at all,
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.940]   the word of God is going to blow it out of the water.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.940]   If not, I didn't do my job.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.940]   Now you're nervous.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.940]   Now I'm nervous.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.940]   1 Peter 3, 7.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.940]   "You husbands in the same way
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.940]   live with your wives in understanding way
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:19.940]   as with someone weaker since she is a woman."
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.940]   You know?
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.940]   Okay.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.940]   Let me read it again for emphasis, alright?
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.940]   "You husbands in the same way
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.940]   live with your wives in understanding way
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.940]   as with someone weaker since she is a woman."
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.940]   Now if I stop right there,
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.940]   some of you guys are going to say,
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:40.940]   "That's in the Bible?
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   We should switch to NIV or something."
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.940]   In this day and age,
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.940]   you're going to write this
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.940]   and you're going to read this
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.940]   and you should be okay with this?
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.940]   When you understand what's going on culturally,
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.940]   you read this completely different.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.940]   You know, you guys all know
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.940]   we live in what's called a cancel culture.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.940]   And so we have the new generation
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.940]   who's judging the old generation
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.940]   of certain things that they used to say.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.940]   Now it's unacceptable.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.940]   Perfectly acceptable 20 years ago,
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.940]   but you can't say it now.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.940]   One of the clearest things that I've noticed
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:15.940]   in the last 20 years
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.940]   is that you can't say Oriental.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:19.940]   Some of you guys are in a generation
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.940]   where the Oriental is offensive to you.
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.940]   I heard that growing up,
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.940]   you know, since I was a kid, Oriental.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.940]   There's that Oriental kid.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.940]   He's like, "Yeah, right here."
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:28.940]   Right?
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.940]   Because that was not a problem, right?
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.940]   In fact, when we lived in Kansas,
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.940]   my teacher, you know,
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:34.940]   I was still using my Korean name at that time.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.940]   She couldn't say my name,
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.940]   so she would just say,
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.940]   "That China boy back there."
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   And I don't remember standing up
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.940]   thinking like, "China boy?
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.940]   You racist."
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:45.940]   Whenever she said, "China boy,"
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.940]   I said, "Here."
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.940]   Because I was the only Asian kid in that room,
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:51.940]   and she wasn't being racist.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.940]   She was, you know,
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   she was just distinguishing me
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   because she couldn't say my name.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   So I didn't feel the need to like,
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940]   "Oh, I got to confirm."
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.940]   I never even thought twice about it
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.940]   until, you know, I got older,
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.940]   and I said, "Yeah, she used to call me China boy."
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.940]   And I don't think it was anything derogatory.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.940]   Now if she said,
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.940]   "That greasy Chinese kid over there,"
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.940]   that would have been, right?
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.440]   That would have been racist.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   But I didn't hear it that way
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   because in that culture,
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   it was just, you know,
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.440]   maybe there are some things
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   that are positive that progress
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440]   that maybe we shouldn't say.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440]   But the fact of the matter is,
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.440]   today we have a younger generation
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   who grew up in a different culture
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   judging the older generation
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   saying, "You did this, you did that."
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.440]   That's unacceptable, right?
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440]   And sometimes I think
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.440]   we get way carried away with that.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.440]   Now I say all of this
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   because the Bible was written 2,000 years ago
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   in a completely different culture.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.440]   And we have to understand
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   that when this passage was written,
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.440]   women had no right to vote.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.440]   They had no right to own property.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   They were actually considered
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   property of the man.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.440]   So if she didn't cook the food right,
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440]   he could have just said,
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   "You know, I don't like her,"
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.440]   and send her off.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.440]   And because she had no right,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440]   she was forced to either be homeless
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.440]   or sell her body to take care of herself
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.440]   and possibly her children
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440]   because the wife and the children
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:14.440]   had no rights of their own.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.440]   That's why when they had the 5,000,
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.440]   they only counted the men.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   When 600,000 people went into the desert,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.440]   they only counted 600,000 men.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.440]   And that's the culture that they lived.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   So when the first century Jew
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.440]   read this passage,
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.440]   this is how they would have read it.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.440]   "You husbands, in the same way,
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.440]   live your wives in an understanding way
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.440]   as with someone weaker
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.440]   since she is a woman."
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.440]   They understood.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   "And show her honor as fellow heir
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440]   of the grace of life."
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.440]   What?
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   Fellow heir?
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.440]   You know what a Jewish male
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.440]   used to pray?
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.440]   "Thank God I'm not a Gentile,
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   a dog, or a female."
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.440]   And the reason why they prayed that
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:13.440]   is because they were treated so poorly
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.440]   by the Jewish community.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.440]   So it wasn't necessarily that they were being harsh.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.440]   It was just, "Thank God."
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   It's just like somebody who you see suffering.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.440]   "Thank God God didn't make me like them."
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.440]   That's where the women were.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.440]   So what would have shocked a first century Jewish male
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   is not they are weaker because they are women.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.440]   Of course they are because we see it.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   We see it. They get treated poorly.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.440]   They are living homeless.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.440]   They are prostituting their bodies
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.440]   because their husband who was a jerk
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   let her go because she burned food.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   But the shocking part of it is
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   "Show her honor as fellow heir
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   of grace of life."
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   And so the way that we respond to this text
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.440]   is exactly the opposite of how the Jewish male
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   would have read this text.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   Because what God was doing
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   was completely revolutionizing.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.440]   That the value of a woman
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   is not dependent upon her physical strength.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   That she has value because God says
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   she is a fellow heir of the grace of God.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   Fellow heir.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.440]   There is no male or female
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   in the kingdom of God.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   And so he was demolishing the prejudice of men
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.440]   at that time that might is power.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.440]   And so what he was doing was completely the opposite.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.440]   When we read this with a feministic mindset
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.440]   we say how can he possibly say that
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.440]   not realizing it was because of Christ.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.440]   He completely revolutionized not only Christianity
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.440]   but world itself.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440]   Because Christianity was the first
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:51.440]   first, first religion.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.440]   First paradigm shifting toward female.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   It was because of Christianity.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   Now why do I say all of that?
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   And what does this have to do with anything?
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440]   Because he says all of that
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.440]   was to honor women.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.440]   Which would have been very, very difficult
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440]   for them to do in the first century.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440]   He says so what?
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.440]   So that your prayers would not be hindered.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.440]   Think how radical that is.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   That God elevates women to the point
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.440]   that if you don't take care of your wife
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.440]   you can't even pray.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.440]   And the reason why you need to honor women
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.440]   is so that you can be effective in prayer.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.440]   That's how much he was elevating women at that time.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.440]   So that you can pray.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.440]   We need to live righteous lives.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.440]   We need to understand scripture.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   We need to have right thinking.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.440]   All of this so that we can pray.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.440]   Because the power is in prayer.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.440]   Think how feeble you and I are.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440]   Have you ever seen with your own eyes
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.440]   the coronavirus?
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   I mean I'm not talking about on the screen or television.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   They call it the coronavirus
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.440]   but in Spanish it's crown.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   And if you look at the virus it looks like a crown.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.440]   There are certain parts of it.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   And that's why they call it coronavirus.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   You and I have never seen that with our eyes.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   It's so small.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.440]   I mean we don't know until we see the effects of it.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.440]   Well that tiny little thing
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440]   that you and I can't even see with our own eyes
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.440]   has shut down the world.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.440]   You get sick enough
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   you could even die from that.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.940]   That's how weak and feeble you and I are.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.940]   That's something that tiny can destroy us.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.940]   Mankind. Period.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.940]   And so for us to think that if we get organized,
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.940]   if we're smart enough, if we're educated,
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.940]   if we have the right teaching, right theology,
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.940]   that we're going to change the world.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.940]   He said no.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.940]   All of that has to happen so that we can pray.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:53.940]   In the Bible it says in a large house
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.940]   there are articles of ignoble things and noble things.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.940]   He says if you want to be used by God
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.940]   to get rid of ignoble things.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:04.440]   So that we can bring an empty container.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   An empty container.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.440]   Not filled with, you know, I got this experience,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.440]   I got this talent, I've done this, I have that.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.440]   And then we bring a container that's full
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   and it says all that is ignoble.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.440]   He says no. Empty yourself.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.440]   That's why the Bible keeps telling us
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.440]   humble yourself. Humble yourself.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   And that's why the word of God first and foremost
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   judges the thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   If the primary concern that we are overly concerned about
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.940]   is other people, you're probably missing the whole point.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.940]   You're not wrestling with your own sins.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.940]   You're not wrestling with your own pride.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.940]   You're not wrestling with your own inclination
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.940]   to be proud because the primary problem
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   with mankind is mankind.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:51.940]   And that's why he says so that you can pray.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.940]   John chapter 15, the whole chapter
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.940]   is about abiding in Christ.
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.940]   You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in Christ.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.940]   Right? He doesn't say it's hard.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.940]   He says you cannot if you do not abide in Christ.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.940]   But after he says that, what does he say?
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.940]   John 15, 7. If you abide in me,
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.940]   my words abide in you,
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.940]   then ask whatever you wish it shall be done for you.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.940]   Why do we need to abide?
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.940]   So that we can be effective in praying.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.940]   So if we get into theology and we get organized
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.940]   and we have all these proper training
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.940]   and Bible classes going and we're doing
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.440]   all this kind of discipleship
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   and yet we are weak in prayer,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   we missed the whole point.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.440]   The whole purpose of salvation
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.440]   is so that we can come to God
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.440]   so that God can do his work.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   And when we don't pray,
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.440]   naturally, we want to be worshipped.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.440]   When good things happen,
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.440]   we want to be recognized.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440]   The very core of human rebellion
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   is wanting to be glorified.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.440]   And so when good things, godly things happen,
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.440]   when we bear fruit or seemingly bear fruit,
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440]   church grows, discipleship happens,
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440]   people acknowledge us and thank us,
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   and we're not praying,
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   we naturally think I had some part in that.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.440]   So even the good things that happen in our lives,
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   it leads to self-glory.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.440]   Some of us are more sophisticated
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440]   so we don't say it in our mouth,
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.440]   but you know it, you feel it, you think it.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.440]   And that thought of I did something
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.440]   is ruining us.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   And we don't even know it.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   Just like Jesus said,
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   it's like a small yeast, right?
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   It leavens the whole bread.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.440]   I don't bake so I don't know how small it takes.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   I've just seen baking happen.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   It only takes a tiny little bit
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   for that whole thing to rise.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.440]   It only takes a tiny little, tiny little pride,
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   ruins everything that we're doing.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   That's the primary reason he says
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440]   don't establish young Christians in leadership
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.440]   because he's going to fall into the same temptation
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   as the devil, that he wants the glory.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.440]   So one of the biggest struggles as leaders in the church,
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   especially, you know, since I'm the senior pastor,
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.440]   the greatest struggle is not to get people sober,
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.440]   is not evangelism.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.440]   The greatest struggle is not training,
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.440]   Bible teaching, all of that is important.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.440]   The greatest struggle is I need to stay humble.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.440]   I need to recognize that I'm just a vessel for him to use.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.440]   And so that's why this is so, so important
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.440]   because the point of what we're doing
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.440]   is to bring us to God and be dependent upon him
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   and him alone.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440]   See, in John chapter 16, 20 through 24,
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440]   Jesus says, "In that day you will not question me
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   about anything.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.440]   I will give it to you.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440]   If you ask the Father for anything in my name,
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.440]   he will give it to you.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   Until now you have asked for nothing in my name.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.440]   Ask and you will receive so that your joy may be made full."
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.440]   He said up to this point you've been praying from a distance.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.440]   There wasn't an indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440]   that's groaning on our behalf.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.440]   But because the end of all things is near,
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440]   because Christ has given us everything that we need
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   for life and Godliness, now you can pray in my name.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.440]   So in my name you can come.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.440]   So up to this point you've been praying
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.440]   from a distance, but now you can draw near.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.440]   So the greatest benefit of our salvation
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.440]   is that we're able to pray unhindered.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.440]   That's the gift of salvation that God has given us.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.440]   So if we do all these other things
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.440]   and yet we are weak in prayer,
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.440]   we are weak in everything.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   Ephesians chapter 6, 18 to 19,
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.440]   after he says, "Gear up for battle.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440]   Put on the full armor of God,"
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   and he concludes by saying,
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   "With all prayers, petitions, pray at all times
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.440]   in the Spirit, and with this in view,
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.440]   be on the alert with all perseverance
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.440]   and petition for all the saints
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.440]   and pray on behalf that the utterance
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.440]   may be given to me in opening my mouth
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440]   to make known what boldness,
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.440]   the mystery of the gospel."
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.440]   He ends this spiritual battle by saying,
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   "Put on the full armor of God, helmet of salvation,
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.440]   breastplate of righteousness,"
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.440]   and then he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.440]   After you've done all of that,
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.440]   pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.440]   Whatever is happening in your life,
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   whatever is happening in your life,
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.440]   if you're not praying,
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   your primary problem is you're not praying.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   Whatever is happening in our culture,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440]   whatever that may be,
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   if you're not praying,
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   the primary problem is we're not praying.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440]   Whatever you notice in your marriage
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.440]   that you're frustrated with,
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   whatever you are thinking about your husband or your wife,
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.440]   if you're not praying,
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   the primary problem is we're not praying.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.440]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.440]   And then when you ask, you're not sober.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   You're not sober.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.440]   You ask for your selfishness.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.440]   So the primary problem of politics
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.440]   is we're not praying enough.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.440]   The primary problem with fellowship
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.440]   is we're not praying enough.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.440]   The primary problem with discipleship
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.440]   is we're not praying enough.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.440]   The primary problem with our children
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   is we're not praying enough.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   Until we have prayed,
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.440]   and we have devoted ourselves to pray,
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.440]   until we have committed ourselves
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440]   and are known for prayer
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   as much as we are known for Bible study,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.440]   everything else is going to be impotent.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.440]   Because what you and I do with our own strength
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.440]   is like trying to jump the Grand Canyon
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:48.440]   and running faster.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.440]   You and I do not have that power.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.440]   And so we recognize that this is our weakness.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440]   This is our weakness.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440]   This is my weakness.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.440]   This is the weakness of our church.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   This is something that we've recognized for years.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.440]   But I feel that we've gotten to a breaking point
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.440]   as our church continues to grow, you know,
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   and we have a lot of different thoughts and opinions
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.940]   about what we should do or should not do.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.940]   We need to focus on this, we need to focus on that.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.940]   And, you know, we have all kinds of opinions.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.940]   Even with this pandemic, we have extremes.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.940]   Some people who are angry that we're not meeting.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.940]   Some people who are angry that we are meeting.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.940]   Some people who are angry because
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.940]   we don't pay enough attention to social justice.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.940]   Some people are angry because
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.940]   we're paying too much attention.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.940]   But of all the different opinions that we have,
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.940]   there's one opinion that I welcome.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.440]   It's that you desire to pray.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.440]   That we do not pray enough.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   You're absolutely right.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   We need to pray.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.440]   We need to be devoted to prayer.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.440]   And until we pray,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   until we really give ourselves to prayer,
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.440]   everything that we're doing is just man's struggle.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.440]   You cannot bring somebody to Christ
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.440]   by being articulate.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:22.440]   The Holy Spirit is the one who judges people of their sins.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.440]   And let me tell you something that you and I absolutely cannot.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.440]   We do not have the power to love people that are hard to love.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   We can like people, we can tolerate difficult people,
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.440]   but the scripture says that the world will identify us by love.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.440]   But not any kind of love, but the love that Christ practiced.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.440]   The love that he says in Romans 8,
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.440]   "In that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.440]   You don't have the strength to do that.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440]   I don't have the strength to do that.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:58.440]   The best that you and I can practice is love people who are likable.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.440]   Tolerate people that are difficult.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.440]   And try not to slander people who have hurt us.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.440]   But to practice the love that Christ practiced with us,
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:15.440]   that's not in you, and that's not in me.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:22.440]   So until we humble ourselves and recognize that we are feeble,
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:27.440]   and we are desperate until Christ intervenes,
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:33.440]   we may have a form of godliness, but not know the power.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.440]   Let me finish with this, 2 Corinthians 7, 12-16.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:42.440]   This is where the temple was built by Solomon in dedication.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:45.440]   This is what the Lord says about the temple.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.440]   "The Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him,
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:54.440]   'I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.440]   If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain,
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.440]   or if I command the locusts to devour the land,
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.440]   or if I send pestilence among my people,
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.440]   and my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray,
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.440]   and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.440]   then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:25.440]   Now my eyes will be opened and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.'"
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:31.440]   So one of the first things that we want to implement in church is,
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.440]   before we open up and do anything else,
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.440]   we want to utilize our Sunday worship better.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   So what we're going to do is, starting from next week,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440]   whether you're at first service or second service,
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.440]   we're going to invite you to come into the sanctuary a bit earlier.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   Come 10-15 minutes earlier.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   We're going to ask the praise team to finish earlier.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.440]   We're going to put up some prayer requests
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   so that you can come in here and take some time to pray.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   Instead of starting a separate prayer meeting,
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.440]   we're going to try to utilize Sunday morning better.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.440]   And again, if you don't know how to pray or you don't know what to pray for,
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.440]   we'll have prayer requests, corporate prayer,
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   that sometimes are turned in or certain things that we're aware of,
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   we'll put it up there, take some time to pray for that.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:17.440]   But we're praying mostly that you would know what to pray for.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.440]   As you pray, that you would begin to pray
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.440]   and let the word of God and the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.440]   and take Sunday morning before the worship.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.440]   After service, you can visit each other,
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.440]   but Sunday morning before worship, 10-15 minutes,
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.940]   we ask you to come.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.940]   One of the benefits of the Zoom,
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.940]   we realize it's much easier to gather on the Zoom than physically.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.940]   One of the problems that we have is we have so many things going on at church,
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.940]   it's hard to add another thing to the calendar.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.940]   But having Zoom, we can just say, "Monday night at 8 o'clock,
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.940]   we're going to take 30 minutes and just come and we're going to pray together."
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:53.940]   And so you'll see some more of that by different pastors, different departments.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.940]   So we're hoping that beyond today,
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.940]   that we're going to do some, hopefully, tangible things.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.440]   And if you don't see that happening,
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.440]   if there's any complaints that I will welcome,
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.440]   you come and say, "Hey, you said we're going to pray, but we're not praying."
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.440]   Good. Right?
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.440]   I want you to keep us accountable and say, "Hey, we're not doing enough.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.440]   We need to pray more."
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   And that is a welcome criticism
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.440]   because we definitely want to head down that direction.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.440]   If you could close your eyes with me,
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   and if I can ask the praise team to come,
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   and I'm going to invite you to take a few minutes to pray
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   as our worship team comes up.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.940]   If you've been overwhelmed by the pressures of life,
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.940]   especially with all that's going on,
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.940]   raising young children,
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.940]   just tired each day,
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.940]   I invite you to pray.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:48.940]   If you've been struggling to keep your head above waters,
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.940]   and some days you just feel like just letting go,
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:55.940]   come and pray.
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:57.940]   If you've been struggling with the same sins
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.940]   and you feel like you've tired everything,
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.940]   you could overcome,
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:07.940]   but feel like you're failing more than succeeding,
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:12.940]   come to the throne of grace to find mercy and help and pray.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.940]   If you've been married for a while,
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.940]   and your marriage didn't quite turn out the way that you were hoping
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.940]   when you got married many years ago,
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:25.940]   come and pray.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.940]   If you're struggling with pain from past hurts, disappointments,
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:33.940]   and can't seem to overcome the bitterness that resides in you,
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.940]   no matter how much you struggle,
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.940]   it only seems one step behind you,
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.940]   come and pray.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:47.940]   If you're concerned about what the world is going to be like in 2021,
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.940]   come and pray.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:54.940]   If you've lost someone that you love this year,
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.940]   and you don't know how you're going to overcome your grief,
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:02.940]   come to Jesus and pray.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:07.940]   If you've been wondering if your past sins are too much to overcome,
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.940]   and though you believe in your head that your sins are forgiven,
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:15.940]   but in your heart you can't seem to let go,
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:19.940]   come, come,
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:24.940]   come to Jesus and pray.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:29.440]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:59.420]   [ Music ]
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:29.400]   [ Music ]
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:59.380]   [ Music ]
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:12.360]   [ Music ]
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:22.340]   >> I will trust my Savior Jesus when my target stops before.
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:31.340]   Trust him when to simply trust him seems the hardest thing of all.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:39.360]   [ Music ]
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   >> I will trust my Savior Jesus.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   Trust him when my strength is small.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   For I know the shield of Jesus is the safest place of all.

[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   >> Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:23.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:33.360]   I will trust my Savior Jesus. He has set his ways best.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   For I know that life he's chosen leads to everlasting rest.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:53.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:27:03.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:23.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.

[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   >> So on the cross, how it was seen.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   I can go now ever trusting in the one who died for me.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   What could I bring for your gift is coming.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:25.360]   So I trust you, simply trust you, good with every heart of you.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:34.360]   So on the cross, how it was seen.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:45.360]   I can go now ever trusting in the one who died for me.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:54.360]   What could I bring for your gift is coming.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:29:07.360]   So I trust you, simply trust you, good with every heart of you.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:17.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:27.360]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.

[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.360]   >> Let's pray.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.360]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.360]   blameless with great joy, to the only God our Savior,
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.360]   through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion,
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.360]   and authority before all time and now and forever.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   Amen.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.360]   >> God sent his son.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:19.360]   They called him Jesus.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:29.360]   He came to love, heal, and forbear.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   An empty grave is there to be a Savior live.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:59.360]   Because he lived, I can face tomorrow.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   Because he lived, all fear is gone.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:19.360]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:30.360]   And life is worth the living just because he lived.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.360]   >> Amen.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.360]   All right, before you go, I just remembered the announcements.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.360]   Okay, so one is I wanted to give you an update.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.360]   We took an IMB missions offering during Christmas Day,
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360]   and we didn't update you on that.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   We were able to collect more than $17,000 that we're going to be sending to the IMB.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.360]   So again, thank you for your generosity,
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   and that is going to be used to support our international missionaries,
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.360]   obviously Pastor Alex and Harry and their family as well.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:04.360]   The second thing is we have a new members class that's starting -- I forgot the date.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.360]   So 17th.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:12.360]   On the day of our members meeting, we're starting at least that morning at 830.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   Oh, 9 o'clock.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.360]   Okay, so just to give you a heads up on that.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360]   All right, so if you forget, it will be on the website somewhere.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   So we can have that side of the group leave on that side,
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   and then you guys can just take a minute to kind of stroll out that way.
