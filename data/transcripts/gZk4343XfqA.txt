[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.780]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.060]   As you know, if you've been listening for a while,
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.300]   we get heartbreaking emails regularly,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.180]   and that includes this one from an anonymous woman.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.860]   "Pastor John, I am a new widow,
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.180]   mother of two young boys in my mid-30s.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.420]   My husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.740]   from what we did not know at the time
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.560]   was bacterial pneumonia, which quickly became septic shock.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700]   He also had an underlying heart condition.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.740]   He died one week before his 34th birthday.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.540]   He was normal one day and home with the Lord
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.060]   in three days later.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.820]   My question relates to the issue of blame
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.840]   and God's timing in his death.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.900]   We had thought his ailments were a flu bug or COVID
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.420]   and didn't realize the severity of what was truly going on.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540]   We had responded by following telephone guidance
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.460]   from a Christian homeopathic provider
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.580]   who had also assumed COVID,
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.460]   someone we trusted but perhaps should not have.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.960]   As I grieve, I can't seem to stop blaming myself.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660]   I desperately want reassurance to know
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.940]   that I did not hurt my husband, let him down,
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.340]   or by our actions, shorten his lifespan.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.780]   I tried to care for him and protect him as best as I could
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.180]   based on the knowledge that I had at the time.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.460]   We didn't know we were wrong.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.060]   Once we were in the ER and discovered
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.540]   he was facing septic shock,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380]   I prayed fervently for the Lord to rescue and heal him.
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.400]   I guess I'm left wondering if I should continue
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.140]   to feel responsible.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140]   I need help to trust God if he was responsible.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.860]   And if so, that he is still good despite taking my soulmate
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.300]   and my best friend home at such a young
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.220]   and difficult to understand time.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.600]   I would greatly appreciate any help you can offer me.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.460]   - The reference to COVID makes me realize how recent
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.140]   and raw this loss is.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.900]   This didn't happen five years ago.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.780]   - Right.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.140]   - So I want to be so careful.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.660]   I think the fact that she is reaching out to us
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.480]   in this fairly public way is a good sign
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   that she hasn't despaired of discovering new things
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.800]   in God's word that might ease the pain.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.060]   And I think she's right in that.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.700]   There are new things.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.340]   I'm sure she hasn't yet seen that God wants her to see
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.220]   for her own help and comfort and hope.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.980]   I think there will be new fresh things in fact
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.540]   for her to see for the next 50 years.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.500]   She will see things in God's word 50 years from now
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.580]   that will shed light on this heart wrenching loss
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.260]   in such a way, even at that distance,
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   to make the love of Christ and the memory of her husband
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.580]   even more precious.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.500]   I am seeing things at age 76 that are shedding light
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.700]   on sorrows that I experienced 60 years ago.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   I still am getting new light on the meaning of those years.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.020]   So I expect that for her.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.700]   I think the way I would like to come at this
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.620]   is to raise the question, and it may sound surprising,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.460]   what would you do, how would you think if you knew
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.200]   that it was your fault that your husband died?
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.860]   Now, I'm not suggesting that it was at all.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.300]   Clearly it was not your fault.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.380]   But I'm asking you to make an experiment in your mind.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.420]   What if you had failed to put the emergency brake
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.980]   on the car and it had rolled over him and killed him
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.860]   while he was working on it?
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.800]   What if you were helping him clean one of his hunting guns
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.060]   and it accidentally went off and killed him?
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.260]   What if you fell asleep at the wheel and crashed
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.380]   and only he died in the wreck?
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.860]   What if you mixed up one of his medications?
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.740]   Or maybe instead just ask,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.480]   how would you counsel somebody in that situation?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.360]   Because there are thousands of people
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.220]   in that very situation.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.580]   They don't just wonder if they could have done more
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.860]   to save their loved one.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.940]   They know they caused the death accidentally.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.980]   Now, I suppose I could join the chorus
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.380]   of everyone around you and say what is obvious,
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.920]   namely, you did all you could.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.420]   Nobody is doubting your love
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.420]   and your care for your husband.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.420]   Everybody knows you are not responsible for his death.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.100]   And I do join that chorus.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.380]   But I don't think you wrote to us
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.820]   just for me to say the obvious
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.380]   that everybody else is saying, it's not your fault.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.760]   So what I want to say is,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.860]   if the Bible has an answer
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.820]   for how you would press on in life with freedom and hope
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.020]   and usefulness, and even eventually joy,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.660]   even if you had caused his death,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.540]   then how much more can you be assured
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.300]   that God will help you press on in life with freedom
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.540]   and hope and usefulness and eventually joy
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.060]   when you did not cause the death
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.840]   and were helpless to stop it?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.060]   Most of the time, we turn to Genesis 50 verse 20
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.140]   to remind ourselves that all the bad things
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.300]   that happened to Joseph turned out for good
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.180]   by God's design, remember?
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.580]   He said, "As for you, you brothers, you rascal brothers
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.780]   who caused all this trouble,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.820]   as for you, you meant evil against me,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.700]   but God meant it for good."
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.540]   So we usually focus on Joseph
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.380]   and all the bad things that happened to him,
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.220]   but very rarely do we ponder what that verse means
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.020]   for Joseph's brothers who really were guilty
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.020]   of multiple sins that caused Joseph's misery.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.980]   And here's what Joseph says in the next verse
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.580]   to those brothers.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.180]   "So do not fear.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.980]   I will provide for you and your little ones."
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.020]   Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.820]   Wow.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.700]   This does not mean they are not guilty.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.700]   They are guilty, but it does mean that God has a future
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.260]   and a purpose for them, even though they were guilty.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.260]   They were the guilty ones and they caused all that misery
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.780]   for 17 years of Joseph's life.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.500]   And through one of them, amazingly, Judah,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.380]   God would even bring a savior into the world.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:46.380]   Now, Paul handled his own guilt as a murderer the same way.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.100]   He saw that God had a merciful purpose in it
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.740]   for other guilty people.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.620]   He said in 1 Timothy 1:16,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.220]   "I received mercy for this reason,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.100]   that in me, as the foremost of sinners,
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.020]   Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.500]   as an example to those who were to believe in him
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.740]   for eternal life."
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.820]   In other words, somehow Paul was able to transpose
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:26.500]   the horrible sounding guilt of persecution
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.460]   and killing at his own hands
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.460]   into the beautiful music of mercy through him
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.980]   to other guilty sinners to whom God
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.260]   would show amazing patience.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.060]   Then change the focus just slightly from situations
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.740]   where someone really was guilty,
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.820]   but God made a future for them,
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.900]   from that to the man born blind in John 9.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.220]   Now here, the apostles assume that someone must have sinned.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:08.500]   They just must have sinned for this calamity
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.100]   to come upon this blind man.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:16.260]   Like you, perhaps, from time to time are tempted to think,
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.020]   did we do something wrong?
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.140]   Can there be a catastrophic loss like this
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.180]   without someone having done something sinful?
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.420]   So they asked Jesus, "Rabbi, who sinned,
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.420]   this man or his parents that he was born blind?"
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:42.100]   And Jesus answered, "It was not that this man sinned
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.660]   or his parents, but that the works of God
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.340]   might be displayed in him."
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.460]   Now that is an amazing answer.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.780]   And surely it applies to your situation.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.620]   Who sinned?
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.740]   Who was neglectful?
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.700]   Who put their trust in the wrong place?
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.340]   Who reacted too slowly?
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.260]   Who failed to see the symptoms?
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.580]   Who's guilty here?
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.740]   Where's the sin?
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.140]   There's gotta be sin here.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.300]   To which Jesus answers, "It was not that you
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.740]   or your homeopathic advisor or your doctors
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.820]   or your husband sinned or were neglectful
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.420]   or put your trust in the wrong place
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.420]   or reacted too slowly or failed to see the symptoms.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.300]   Rather, it was that the works of God
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.100]   might be displayed in him."
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.500]   To which you ask, "What works?"
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.260]   Well, for starters, your persevering faith
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.420]   in the reality and power and wisdom and goodness of God.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.220]   That is a miraculous work of God.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.380]   But it might be helpful for you to think on this.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:07.740]   When your husband died, God set in motion
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.220]   10,000 effects that you can't see.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.140]   Some of them will become manifest in a year or two,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.540]   and some of them in 50 years.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.900]   Your husband's death did not take God off guard,
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.900]   nor was it meaningless or absurd or without profound purpose.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:37.500]   A holy purpose, a sacred, precious purpose,
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.980]   precious in the sight of the Lord
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.500]   is the death of his saints.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.860]   Psalm 113 and 116, "Your eyes, O God,
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.700]   saw my husband's unformed substance
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.580]   while he was being knit together in his mother's womb.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.940]   In your book were written every one of them,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.540]   the days that were formed for him,
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.980]   when as yet there was none of them.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.980]   His days were written down with divine wisdom
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.060]   and the 10,000 ripple effects that flow out
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.060]   from his life and his death will not be in vain.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.460]   Some of them you will know in this life,
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.100]   most of them you won't.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.700]   You are being tested,
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.660]   but God has promised not to test you beyond your strength.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.380]   1 Corinthians 10, 13, "God is faithful.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.460]   He will not let you be tested beyond your ability,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.980]   but with the test, he will also provide the way of escape
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.580]   that you may be able to endure it."
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.220]   Jesus promised his disciples
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.260]   that they would have trouble in the world,
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.620]   and he also promised peace in the midst of it.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.060]   John 16, 33, "I have said these things to you
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.340]   that in me you may have peace.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.460]   In the world you will have trouble.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.820]   Take heart, I have overcome the world."
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.180]   So that's what I want to leave you with,
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.580]   the promise of peace, Christ's own peace.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.780]   John 14, 27, "Peace I leave with you.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.700]   My peace I give to you.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.580]   Not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.380]   Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.860]   Neither let it be afraid.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.340]   There is a future and a hope.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.900]   No suffering of God's loved ones is in vain."
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.220]   - Thank you for that hopeful word, Pastor John,
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.780]   and thank you for the raw email.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.500]   It takes courage to write it out, and we appreciate it,
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.740]   and we're humbled that you would send it to us.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.820]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.380]   You can ask a question of your own,

[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.820]   Speaking of heavy topics,
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.220]   should we break a friendship over a gospel disagreement,
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.780]   a disagreement about what constitutes gospel truth?
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.140]   Yes, Pastor John says, we should be willing to do that,
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.300]   and he will explain why
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.100]   and when that dramatic step is needed on Monday.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.060]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.740]   We'll see you back here on the other side of the weekend.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.940]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.900]   We'll see you then.

[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.060]   (upbeat music)
