[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.400]   Hi Berean family, my name is Brian Le and I'm a fourth year at the Berean College Ministry
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   and I'd like to share how God has worked in my life.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.640]   So it's hard to know what life was like without knowing God because all my life I felt that
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.440]   God was always there.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.960]   I was raised in a Christian household.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.160]   My mom would take us to church every Sunday.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.360]   We'd have nightly Bible studies and we'd pray every night.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.960]   I grew up with friends and family who were Christian and it felt like I was surrounded
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.880]   by God's love.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.080]   During this time I remember absorbing all the things from church and the things that
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.480]   my mom was teaching me and I took them as truth because that was the only thing I knew.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.200]   I was challenged though early on that I had to make my faith my own and that this can't
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.240]   just be second-handed for me.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.400]   But even with that, naturally I'm just a very obedient person and I like to please my parents
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.320]   and so even making faith my own felt a little forced as well.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.240]   However there were times though growing up in middle school, high school where I felt
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.280]   convicted by the gospel and God's gift of salvation.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.400]   I remember at a retreat I thought that I felt God's love and the idea of Jesus sacrificing
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.880]   himself on the cross really compelled me.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.800]   So my eyes were really open to just sin in my life and what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.880]   As growing up I didn't really see my own sin.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.600]   I thought just because I grew up in a Christian household that I was inherently saved but
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   that was far from the case.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.560]   I was a sinner and I was against God and just because I may have grew up set apart I still
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.880]   needed to look deep into my own sin.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.160]   And that was kind of shown throughout high school where at my home church things changed,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.480]   leadership changed and every Sunday it started becoming just topical and it was very devoid
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.840]   of scripture and Bible and I knew that this was wrong.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.560]   I knew that at this church I wasn't being spiritually fed and the only reason why I
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.640]   stayed was because of the friends that I had made since childhood.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.880]   And so even because of this I still continued to stay and I didn't even pursue God on my
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.640]   own.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.760]   Before I knew that as humans we would sin and I always thought that even though I was
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.080]   a sinner God's grace, he forgives us.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.560]   And even though that's true I neglected the importance of genuine repentance and fully
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.080]   surrendering myself to Jesus and that would break the cycle of sin.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.520]   So in college I started going to Bible teaching church but I failed to really integrate myself
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.920]   in the community and so each Sunday I would just go receiving head knowledge of the Bible
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.280]   and the scripture but never actually applying it in my life.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.360]   And it wasn't until I came to Verion just this year was that I really felt convicted
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:40.640]   by what God was telling me that before God I stand before righteous God and that I am
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.760]   fully just and through his son's sacrifice that I can now have that relationship with
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.560]   him and that was something that I failed to connect all those years before that now talking
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.480]   to God is not just someone I'm speaking out just randomly or blindly but I now have a
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.320]   relationship with him and that has been restored through Jesus' sacrifice.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.880]   So from that I really started to see fruit in my life where I didn't see before.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:21.320]   Now I have a need to spread the gospel whenever I can to any unbelieving friends or family.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:30.280]   Just having now I have that faith even though before in college where it was just idle and
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.480]   dry and I would use Christianity as a crutch now I see it as my faith is unshaken.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.920]   I can completely devote my life to God and now I know that I am filled with the Holy
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   Spirit and not something that I'm just surrounded by just because of friends and family.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.160]   I have now a desire to build my relationship with Jesus because I want to read intently
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   his word.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.260]   I know that my body was purchased by the death of Jesus and I need to submit to him through
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.480]   complete surrenderance and devotion to Christ.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.960]   I want to strive to become a better brother, a better son not just in my family but with
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.320]   Christ and I know that truly it's only through Christ that I can accomplish all these things
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.800]   and everything I do is for the glory of God.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.880]   Now looking back at my life I know that God has been sovereign everywhere just from my
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   upbringing from where I went to church to who I made friends with I know that his perfect
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.360]   plan has brought me from death and into his loving presence and the greatest showcase
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.760]   of his love I think is from Romans 5 8 where he says in that while we were still sinners
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.320]   Christ died for us.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   Thank you.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   Brian you understand when you go into the water you're united with Christ in his death
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   and when you're coming out you're united with his resurrected life.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   I do.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.160]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.520]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.680]   (audience applauding)
