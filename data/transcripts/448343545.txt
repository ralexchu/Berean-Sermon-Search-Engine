[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hi church family.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   My name is Jessica and I'm part of the family ministry.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.840]   I'm married to Joseph and I'm also
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.520]   Anthony Rockmut's older sister.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.080]   Anyways, this is my testimony.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.240]   Like many of you, I was blessed to have grown up
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   in a loving Christian home where most of my
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.040]   extended relatives are faithful believers.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.020]   I grew up going to Sunday school, church retreats,
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.920]   listening to worship songs in the car
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.660]   and I was even baptized when I was 10
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.560]   because I thought I believed in God
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.100]   simply because it was just what I grew up with.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.240]   And although I can see the seeds that God
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.080]   had planted in my childhood,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.880]   I hadn't come to know him personally
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.160]   and what it meant to have him as my savior and lord
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.220]   until much later near the end of high school.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.200]   Before meeting Christ, I thought I was a good person.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.460]   I had straight A's, was a goody two shoes,
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.020]   a teacher's pet, friends with everybody
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.900]   and a good Christian.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.300]   I had so much pride in this image of myself
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.680]   that I had made.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.640]   I also stubbornly believed that my life was my own
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.380]   and that I was entitled to get whatever worldly successes
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.620]   I could get with hard work and determination.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.180]   As a result, I was incredibly ambitious
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.460]   and one of my favorite things to do to achieve
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.460]   the success was to plan excessively.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.920]   I like to plan year by year, month by month,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.440]   hour to hour.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.580]   I had a backup plan for every scenario
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.020]   and I arrogantly believed that I could make my life
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740]   and future the way I wanted it to be.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.000]   My shallow faith, if I could even call it that,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.140]   quickly diminished throughout high school
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.000]   when so much uncertainty was in the air.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.020]   Because of my non-existent faith,
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.300]   I doubted God's existence every time something
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.220]   didn't go according to my master plan.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.420]   But by the end of high school,
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.820]   I was feeling the strain of living a double life
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.800]   and trying to serve two masters,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.460]   being a so-called Christian by label
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.820]   while at the same time idolizing the things of this world.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.340]   Luckily, through God's sovereignty,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.200]   he eventually led me to a crossroads
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.020]   with my internal battle.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.980]   I wrestled for weeks with conflicting thoughts,
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.460]   wanting to leave the life I built for myself
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.340]   but at the same time being scared to let go of control,
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.900]   wanting to follow Christ but not knowing the way.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900]   Also, despite growing up in church,
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140]   I didn't know how to read the Bible for myself
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.940]   or even who to ask.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.720]   It's in this context where weeks of struggling
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.420]   culminated into a desperate prayer.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.980]   I remember this prayer because it was the first time
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.860]   I openly and earnestly prayed to God
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.040]   and called out to him,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.340]   the first time I was willing to relinquish my control
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.140]   and my will for his.
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.980]   By God's grace and through the spirit,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.540]   I realized how pointless and vain
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.820]   my previous pursuits had been,
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.980]   how extremely arrogant, selfish, prideful,
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.620]   and ultimately sinful I was living my life.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.020]   I wanted so desperately to feel alive
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.820]   by chasing riches and success
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.500]   that I thought would lead to life,
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.820]   not realizing at that time that true life comes from Christ.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.940]   Finally broken down and exhausted
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.300]   after years of squandering my life,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.900]   I was finally at a point where I was ready
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.740]   to give up control.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.320]   And all I wanted was to be with God
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.420]   and to go wherever he would be willing to lead me.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.020]   But despite realizing this conclusion,
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.020]   I still carried a heavy guilt and doubt.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.880]   Would God still receive me after everything I had done
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.820]   to ignore him and run the opposite way?
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.140]   I knew after everything I'd done,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.140]   I had no right to come before God
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.660]   or even ask for forgiveness.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.780]   But desperate, all I could do was pray.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.660]   And I told God that I wanted to know him
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.460]   and that I would forsake my worldly plans
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.540]   if he would lead me.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.700]   It was through this prayer that my mind and heart
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.260]   were finally illuminated.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.460]   Growing up in church, I had always known
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.980]   the facts of the gospel, but suddenly it became clear.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.180]   It was like in an instant I was a new person redeemed,
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.460]   just like it says in 2 Corinthians 5.17.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.580]   If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.260]   The old things passed away, behold, new things have come.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.220]   I still had the memory of my old self,
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.860]   but it was now replaced by these new things,
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.680]   hope, joy, and extreme gratitude
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.280]   that I finally understood what it means
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.560]   to intimately know the resurrected Christ.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.100]   My outward circumstances back then
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.180]   didn't change after this prayer,
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.540]   but suddenly my prior worries seemed so small
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.580]   in comparison to knowing the God of the universe,
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.660]   my Lord and Savior, who died and rose again for my sins
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.940]   and forgave me despite how undeserving I was.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.260]   Ephesians says, "In him we have redemption
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.220]   "through his blood, the forgiveness of sins
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.960]   "in accordance with the riches of God's grace.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   "Through his rich love and mercy,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.880]   "he not only received me, but embraced me,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.080]   "like the father who was waiting
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.740]   "while still at a far distance
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.820]   "and ran to embrace his prodigal son."
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.040]   I realized that all those years
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.180]   I was running towards the world,
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.140]   he had been patiently waiting and pursuing me.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.220]   I had gained the unshakable love and comfort
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.020]   that if God was with me and I abide in him,
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.220]   who or what could be against me?
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.060]   This was about nine years ago,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.640]   and I've gone through a few trials
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.700]   and life stages since then,
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.360]   but through it all, God continues to remind me
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.500]   every day of his grace and sovereignty in my life.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.100]   He continues to grow and sanctify me
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.820]   into the image of his son,
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.780]   constantly convicting me to live a life
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.220]   worthy of the calling that he has redeemed me to.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.280]   I've stumbled more times than I can count,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.820]   but when I am tempted to despair,
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.700]   I am reminded to look at the cross
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.860]   and the hope I have in Christ,
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.900]   knowing that my God has the power
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.580]   to bring my faith to completion.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.420]   Thank you.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.340]   (audience applauds)
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.100]   (water trickles)
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:44.620]   - This guy, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.180]   you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.020]   and when you come out,
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.740]   you're uniting with his resurrected life?
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.580]   - I do.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.620]   - Then I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.700]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.460]   Okay, pinch your nose, all of it.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.220]   (water trickles)
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.220]   (audience applauds)
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.380]   (audience applauding)
