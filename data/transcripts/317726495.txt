[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   One that says, "How many licks does it get, take to get to the Tootsie Roll Center of
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.840]   a Tootsie Pop?"
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   So immature.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.480]   Are you a youth group?
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.480]   Seventeen.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.280]   I'm just kidding.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.060]   I don't know.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.280]   But we are going to do a Q&A time, and we are going to talk briefly about like some
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.840]   of the questions that I did receive, even about today and yesterday's sermon, even in
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.500]   terms of things like personal stuff, like how did you meet your wife, that kind of stuff.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.940]   Everything is on the table.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.440]   You can ask, and I do have about nine questions here, including like spiritual warfare, demons,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   hell.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.440]   There's stuff like this.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.860]   And so I'm sure it'll be of interest, but I just want to start with a word of prayer,
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.680]   and then there are two questions that I was already asked quite a bit today.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.240]   And so let's pray, and then we'll get this section of our lockdown, I mean retreat.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.800]   We'll continue.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.980]   Father, thank you for just your kindness in our lives.
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.920]   Thank you for working in our hearts.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.460]   Thank you for allowing us to wrestle.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.200]   Thank you for just your Word.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.840]   It's not always easy to understand, but we acknowledge it's a problem with our lack of
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.880]   understanding more than it is with contradictions in your Scripture.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.120]   We pray for your help that we would just be engaged in how you work, and I'm sure one
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.000]   person's question affects more than just that person.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.200]   And so we pray for just your guidance over this time, and we pray these things in Jesus'
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   name.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.680]   First question I got was the parable of the soils.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.700]   What are the second and third soils?
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.700]   Are they Christian?
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.640]   Are they not?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.400]   Like if I can be a third soil, does that mean like I lose my salvation?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.800]   This might be a little bit challenging to understand, but parable of the soils, the
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.320]   first soil, not a Christian.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320]   That's pretty evident.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.400]   Parable, the soil two and three, also not Christian.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.920]   Okay, so that, if you guys are like, "Oh, I'm like two," or "I'm like three," that might
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.520]   be a little bit of like a shock.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.200]   But parable of the soils, soil two and three, not Christian.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400]   That's what you would call apostate.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   Apostasy is when someone who commits to membership inside the universal church but leaves it.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.280]   They are not Christians because in...
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.880]   You guys ever hear of TULIP, the five points of Calvinism?
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.600]   Total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement?
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   Aye.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   Irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.240]   True Christians will persevere to the very end, and that's a theme all throughout scripture.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.960]   But 1 John 2, 18, it says they went out from us, but they weren't really of us.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.120]   That's why they went out from us.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.440]   Okay, so soils two and three, for whatever the reason, they're not Christian.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.800]   It's apostasy.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.680]   So the mark of your Christianity 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   now will be seen then.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.920]   Okay, so that's why you need to persevere.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.560]   You can be baptized and not be a Christian.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.640]   And is that the fault of a church?
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   Not necessarily.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.440]   Acts chapter 8, Simon Magi gets baptized, and he believes intellectually.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.400]   But a few verses down, if you actually look at Acts chapter 8, Simon Peter comes and says,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.080]   "I see you are full of bitterness, and you need to repent," right, because he wanted
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.260]   to purchase the Holy Spirit with money.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.900]   So you see people getting baptized even by the apostles, by the deacons even that may,
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.940]   at the end of the day, not be saved.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.300]   Okay, so that is something to wrestle with.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.820]   Apostasy is a scary thing.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.660]   One saved, always saved is true.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.660]   Okay, but you just got to make sure that you had once been saved.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.420]   Okay, but we assume when you're in a church that we're operating under the assumption
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.260]   that you are a believer.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.380]   And when church discipline happens, it's basically the church's position that this person is
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.500]   not a believer, and you remove them from the church.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.780]   The church actually has biblical authority.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.940]   I don't know if you guys know what those three things are, but the first thing that the church
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.620]   has in terms of biblical authority is to engage in spiritual warfare.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.260]   Okay, second thing the church was given authority was to proclaim the gospel and entrance into
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.500]   the kingdom.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.620]   The third is exercise discipline.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.020]   So to excise the worthless parts or the wasteful parts in the body.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.660]   And so that's the authority that the church has been given.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.500]   It has been abused for sure throughout history, but those are the things that, I mean, those
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.580]   are things that we do need to wrestle through.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.300]   So parable of the four soils, hopefully that's clear and sobering that soil one, two, and
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.300]   three are not Christian.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.460]   Okay, second question I got was how in the world do you do Bible study like that?
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.660]   How do you do 12 hours?
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.060]   Someone like, someone was like, "12 hours, huh?"
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.300]   He actually said that to me, to my face.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.540]   And I'm a storyteller, so I do like to embellish, but when it comes to certain numbers, I try
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.900]   not to exaggerate because numbers you want to kind of keep accurate.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.380]   So, 5.15 I wake up.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.300]   I get up and I start with my memory verses in my head.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.860]   I go into the shower.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.180]   I'm just going to talk about last week, okay?
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.220]   Go into the shower and I'm in there like 20 minutes just going through verses.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.660]   First of all, like it takes me a little bit to wake up fully to go through that.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.380]   Get dressed, I'm still going through different verses.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.220]   And then by the time I get to, I get some coffee and then I'm in the car and then I'm
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.220]   driving.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.700]   And I get to church, typically I'm here around 7, every, like Tuesday to Friday.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.900]   So I've already been in the Word about an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.060]   And when there's traffic, so I turn off the radio, I'm just going through it.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.580]   Seven o'clock to usually nine before the other pastors come in, all I'm doing is I'm spending
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.500]   time in the Word, right?
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.160]   Four hours.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.200]   If we have a meeting, then I have to go into the meeting.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.460]   But from nine to until my lunch appointment usually, which is around 11, 30 to 12, I'm
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.740]   in the Word.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.020]   So whether it's Bible study or...
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.740]   I have a lot of Bible study to prepare.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.540]   But Bible study, sermon prep, I'm just in the Word.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.580]   So basically from five to noon, nonstop, the Bible has been going through in my head.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.900]   I'm on Quizlet typing the verse.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.500]   In my car, I listen to my own voice, "Hebrews 1, 3."
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.780]   And I do...
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.580]   Every possible way I can have it running through my system, I have it.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.580]   And what I do...
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.140]   You know how I do Bible study prep?
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.980]   I do five minutes of Bible study prep, and I do 10 memory verses.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.500]   Five minutes of Bible study prep, 10 memory verses.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.020]   It's sometimes frustrating when I have 20 things to do, and I'm like, "Ah."
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   So I keep going back.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.520]   It's like almost like spiritual ADD, but I just have to keep going back and forth.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.760]   But I've developed that habit so that I'm always in the Word first and foremost.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.200]   So my sermon prep actually doesn't take that long a time, because all the cross-references
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.120]   I had done over the last 15, 20 years.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.640]   So five to noon, just Word.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.360]   Lunch, I take a break.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.800]   But on my drive from here to DJ or Diamond Plaza or wherever I'm meeting somebody, I'm
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.680]   going through another 15 minutes of the Word.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.840]   I come back to church, that drive, I'm in the Word.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.800]   And then from here until about four or five when I leave the church, I do the same thing.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.360]   Bible verses, then sermon prep.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.320]   Bible verses, email.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.520]   Bible verses, calling catering.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   I don't know.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.520]   Bible verses, checking Facebook and ESPN.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.680]   So I do normal stuff.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.800]   But five a.m. to five p.m., I'm in the Word.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.600]   And this past week, believe it or not, I worked out six out of the seven days.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.800]   I know you can't tell.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.160]   But I lift Bible verses, and then I'm on the treadmill.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.360]   This week I did four days of 35 minutes and two days of 40 minutes on the treadmill.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.160]   Guess what I'm going through on the treadmill?
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.200]   And then I go through it in Korean, because I want to retain my Korean.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.960]   But on my Bible verse cards, it's not just verses.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.160]   There are things like, so I actually have my own voice in my head, right?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:09:00.400]   929 chapters Old Testament, 260 chapters New Testament equals 1,189 chapters in the Bible
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   verses.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   23,145 verses in the Old Testament, 7,957 in the New Testament, 31,102 verses in the
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   Bible.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.600]   So facts.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.480]   What was the major, two major divisions in the church, universal church?
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.640]   I got it from Grudem.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.600]   I'm reading Grudem.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.640]   1054, the Orthodox Church splits from the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.680]   1054, because the Pope started changing creeds on his own.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   That's in Grudem.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   Okay?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.600]   And then the second was the Protestant Reformation in the 1600s.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.120]   If I'm reading a book, I read it slowly.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.960]   I'm reading through, well, when I was reading through Shepherding a Child's Heart, every
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.920]   verse that he quotes, if I didn't know it, I would memorize it.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.200]   So I would read slow.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.960]   I don't like John MacArthur, because he quotes too many verses.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.920]   So Master's Plan for the Church, I'm still in chapter one, and I started this in April,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.680]   okay, of last year.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.600]   I just quit, because it's just too, he's like, I'm like, dude, you don't need 18 verses per
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.820]   point, but that's John MacArthur.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.720]   So every book I read, I pay attention, and I actually find out there's a lot of misquoted
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   verses.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.720]   It's a wrong verse.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.480]   Not on John MacArthur's book, okay, but in other books.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:27.640]   Because I will forget that human being's perspective, take opinion on the matter, I'll remember
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.380]   what God's word is.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.360]   The very first verse in Shepherding a Child's Heart is Proverbs 4:23.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.960]   Watch your heart with all diligence, for from its flow the springs of life.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.860]   So everything is done slowly but all day.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.000]   So I'm running, 40 minutes, right, going through verses.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.240]   I get off, I'm driving, six minutes, home, verses.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.800]   Usually I take two showers a day, that's why I never smell bad, okay.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.160]   I'm in the shower again.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.880]   And then, oh, I'm tired, so another 10, 15 minutes.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   And guess what I do after the kids go to sleep?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.600]   I'm back on my computer on Quizlet.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.960]   And in the meantime, I'm doing other stuff.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   Some days it's 15, 16 hours.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.800]   Some days when I'm busy, it's like five or six.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.760]   But regardless, I'm doing it.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:22.760]   When I was on my 70 flights a year, obviously my time is a lot more limited.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.360]   Now I'm a full-time pastor, so it's easier to do, but I was a lot more limited.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.880]   But I still did a Bible plan in 2017, still did a Bible plan in 2018, and I don't like
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   Bible plans, so I quit that this year just to go slow now.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.360]   Whatever it takes, whatever season of life, and that was one of the questions, how do
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.880]   I do this when I'm busy?
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.000]   You find a way.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.240]   If you're doing, have you guys ever studied for like a graduate school test?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.280]   Raise your hand if you studied for a test to get into grad school of some kind, med
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   school, DAT, GMAT, GRE, anything.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.680]   And some of you, while you do that, you have to work, yes or no?
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   Do you make time to study?
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.440]   Some of you are taking the bar?
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.360]   No matter what you're doing, you prioritize that and you make time for it because there
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.440]   are consequences.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.680]   You want to get into a good school.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.480]   What if it's your family member's soul that you always put on the prayer request sheet?
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.960]   I want to pray for my mom, I want to pray for my dad, I want to pray for my sibling.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.280]   But you got to prioritize the Word of God because that's a wasted prayer request if
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.720]   all you're doing is just asking other people to pray for you and you're not so saturated
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.980]   in the Word of God that when you meet with them, it's coming out.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:45.520]   So what, over the last 15, 16 years of just memorizing scripture, what has that done?
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.720]   I find myself when I'm giving advice or when I'm counseling people through whatever it
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:55.200]   is, most of my advice is scripture.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.160]   I don't quote chapter and verse all the time, but it's scripture.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   And you guys are bam.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.120]   And a lot of you come into my office and talk about all kinds of dating stuff.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.240]   And I usually say, "Dating is not biblical.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   It's not in the Bible."
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   Right?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.400]   That's a cultural...
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   But then you have to go into what is a biblical foundation that will give me wisdom on a topic.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   That's how I do it.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   Okay?
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.640]   So to the brother who scoffed at me.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.320]   I calculated it.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.760]   Obviously, if I was working a nine-to-five job somewhere, I could not do this.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.080]   This is my nine-to-five job, so I do it.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.520]   But you'll be surprised at how much time you have while you drive, while you're in the
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.840]   shower, while you're waiting in line.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.800]   If you just memorize five verses of the Bible and those five verses you went to all the
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:53.240]   time when you have time to kill, there were seasons while I've been back where I started
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.040]   watching Walking Dead when I came back here.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.280]   That show is so good that it's so bad.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   It's messed me up.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   Okay?
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.480]   So I'm like seven, eight years behind.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.040]   But every break I used to have, I would take it out.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.560]   You guys know that thing, right?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.680]   Whenever you're doing something, this always happens when you have time to kill.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.440]   Right?
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.360]   But when you stop doing that and you let the Word of God just fill that time, you genuinely
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.480]   are happier and you're more free.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.760]   And it reminds me to love my wife better, to love my kids better.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.200]   So those are things that I would encourage you to try out.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.800]   And you will only do this if you're actually desperate for it.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.640]   But we're all desperate for it.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.360]   But a lot of you who aren't aware that you're desperate for it, this is where you end up
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   drifting.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.360]   Okay?
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.200]   So that's that question.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.400]   Any other follow-up questions on stuff?
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   Feel free to ask.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.640]   I mean, I have some here.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   But I don't want to just keep talking.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.100]   I mean, I have to keep talking to fill the hour.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.120]   How did I meet my wife?
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.880]   And how did I come to Berean?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   It's connected.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.520]   Okay?
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.120]   So, I met my wife in college when I was a senior and she was a freshman, 1999.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.480]   Nothing, don't worry, nothing happened.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.480]   You say, "That's scandal."
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.440]   No, it's not.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   So we...
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.120]   I was the college group president of Berkeley and Stanford Ministries at our church.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.080]   So people were at our place all the time.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.920]   And so her and her friends would come to our apartment all the time because our door was
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.560]   always open.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.680]   And so we became friends.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.560]   After she graduated from college, she came...
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.680]   I got her a job at the SAT center I was teaching at.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.600]   And then she also decided to come to my church.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.440]   No interest on either side.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   And we just started seeing each other every day.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   And then you kind of...
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.560]   That's dangerous stuff.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.880]   You see each other every day, you start thinking you like each other.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.440]   And then you end up liking each other and then you get married and you have twins.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.720]   But that's how that started.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:13.560]   But the way I came to Berean was there was a sister I was dating back in 2002 and 2003
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.800]   who was at Berean when the church was 30 people.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.760]   And I was about to leave ministry because I'm like, "I have too many issues.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   I should not be a pastor."
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.240]   So I was actually gonna take the LSATs and try to get into law school.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.120]   And then because the church was 30 people and then the sister I was dating was one of
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.540]   the members, Pastor Peter's like, "You're dating a youth pastor?"
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.320]   So he wanted to meet.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.680]   I don't know if you know this, but Pastor Peter used to have a business in Las Vegas.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.120]   He was doing like face...
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.800]   He may have mentioned it in a sermon, like sculpting.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.200]   And so he quit that completely, folded it, and he was full-time.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.240]   And it just so happened that God had...
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.680]   He was praying, "God, what do I do with this time now that I have?"
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.800]   And then I emailed him.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.000]   So it's like a divine appointment in that regard.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.920]   Came here, that relationship ended very amicably because we didn't cross any lines.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.600]   And it's easier to break up with someone when from the very get-go you're treating them
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.980]   like that person might be someone else's wife, right?
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.480]   So it was so weird.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.140]   She even asked my wife to help at her wedding reception.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   But anyway, that kind of...
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.360]   It was just like, it was a clean.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.880]   So we ended up coming here a couple years later.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.840]   I was a youth pastor at a different church, many of whom are now here at this church.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.760]   I mean, now they're grown with kids, most of them.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.040]   So yeah, so that's how I ended up here.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.560]   Okay, I keep answering my own questions.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   You guys have any...
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   Well, they're on here.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   Anything?
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.320]   Why you guys have been married 12 years and you only have four-year-old kids?
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   Even things like that, nothing's off the table.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   Edgar.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:14.520]   That's a very good question.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.240]   You guys hear that?
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:25.400]   So it seems like in Matthew chapter 12, Jesus is saying, "Satan cannot cast out Satan."
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.000]   But in the process of...
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.480]   In Matthew 7, it seems like it's the other way around.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:41.600]   I would say in that regard, Judas at that time was not an apostate.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:51.120]   He was fully empowered with the Spirit of God to perform miracles and cast out demons.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.720]   And at that point in time, he had authority, right?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:04.080]   But in the context of Jesus saying that to the Pharisees, he's basically saying, "My
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.120]   interest is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.200]   Satan's interest is preserving the kingdom of hell.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.180]   He's not going to cast out his own demon for that purpose."
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:22.800]   But for Judas during that time, as he had authority over spiritual things at that time,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   it didn't...
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.960]   Like, it wasn't something that fit him.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.760]   So in the context of like spiritual powers, the apostles, if you look at 1 Corinthians
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.760]   12, 12, they were...
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.960]   2 Corinthians 12, 12, they had authority.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.200]   The signs that mark an apostle, miracle signs and wonders were done among you with great
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.240]   perseverance.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.320]   That's what it says.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.740]   And so it could be perhaps at that time he's speaking of in the context of apostles who
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.620]   were able to do that.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.940]   But there aren't too many references, so it's not a contradictory thing, and I think it's
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.780]   just a matter of our limited understanding.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.940]   But I will look into that, and then I'll get back to you, I guess, since we're meeting
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.340]   for dinner on Wednesday.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:09.700]   But Judas is a unique case, and that's why I brought him up yesterday.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:15.180]   Judas had all this authority and then went apostate.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.660]   But can someone...
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.460]   That generates a follow-up question.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.540]   Can someone have the Spirit of God and lose the Spirit of God?
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.540]   Can he...
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.540]   What do you guys think?
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.540]   No.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.540]   Okay.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.540]   Well, if you actually ever read or sing Psalm 51, "Take not your Holy Spirit from me," will
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.300]   God ever take away His Holy Spirit from a believer?
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   Absolutely not.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   Okay.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.620]   And I'm not saying that's the case, but David saw that happen in King Saul.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:49.340]   So in the context of Judas, because the Holy Spirit hadn't come yet, my assumption is that
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:55.300]   the Spirit comes and goes in that time, but not today.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   Okay.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   Anybody else?
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.980]   Dude, he threw like a fastball at me.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.980]   Anybody else?
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.980]   Anything to do with, like, feel...
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.980]   Yes.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:18.380]   I didn't hear the last part.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.700]   No.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:30.500]   At that time, that was possible because it was before God would indwell or tabernacle
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.140]   in a person.
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.140]   So during...
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.780]   For King Saul, the Spirit of...
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.860]   If you look at the Old Testament, the Spirit of God would come and go, basically take over
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.360]   a person, give him strength to do crazy things, and depart if he was not pleased.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.200]   And that happened in many of the kings.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.620]   That happens a lot of times in the judges where the Spirit of God stirs up this person.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:00.820]   But for David, when he's observing the first king of Israel, whom God had appointed because
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:06.100]   of the people's demands, the Spirit of God came on Saul and he did great things.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.900]   And in the power of the Spirit, Saul was victorious in a lot of ways.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.240]   But because of his arrogance and his disobedience, the Spirit of God departed from Saul.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.980]   So David, having observed that, understood what it would be like for the Spirit of God,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.520]   because of his disobedience, could depart and move on.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.460]   And David, this was after Bathsheba.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.020]   So he's like, "I only against you have I sinned."
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.760]   Because he's king.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.160]   He could rape and do whatever he wanted like all the other kings, right?
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.340]   But he understood this violated God's command.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:45.040]   So he was scared that the Holy Spirit will be taken away from him.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.880]   So at that time, that was possible.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.700]   But if you look at John the Baptist, Matthew 11, 11, it says, "There is no one greater
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.420]   born of a woman."
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   There was no one who was born of a woman that has arisen that is greater than John the Baptist.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:05.020]   But he who is leased in the kingdom of heaven has a higher rank than he.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:11.220]   So what's interesting is the thief on the cross, actually not the thief on the cross
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.400]   because the Holy Spirit has not come yet, but for you and me, we may have a higher rank
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.880]   than John the Baptist in the kingdom of God because John the Baptist was old covenant.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.260]   Whereas for us, with the indwelling Holy Spirit, that's a privilege that the saints of old
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.100]   never got to have.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.540]   So I mean, I don't know if that's...
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.340]   Hopefully that answers your question.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.340]   Anybody else?
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:47.940]   You're going to just start asking all these hard questions, everybody.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:57.060]   Yes, Paul.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.980]   Third World Country, prosperity gospel and cults are in there now.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:08.300]   A lot of the prosperity gospel issues and cults are making their way.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:14.140]   So in Third World Countries, they're being lured perhaps by the promise of wealth.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.860]   So I see drifting in that regard.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:24.500]   Bad theology, bad teaching has caused them to hope and trust and believe in things that
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.940]   are not necessarily biblical.
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.940]   So it is...
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:33.140]   I mean, if you look at like Hosea 6.6, like my people perish because of lack of knowledge
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.060]   or Hosea 4.6, my people are perishing from a lack of knowledge and that's what's happening
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.380]   in the Third World Countries.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.380]   So in a lot of countries in the rest of the world where the church is not as strong, you
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.860]   have a lot of false doctrine that's carrying away people, like outright, like false doctrine.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:57.580]   In a country like Uganda or Eastern Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, in that
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:04.720]   part of the area, they had a lot of witch doctors and it was a very voodoo-ridden culture.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.500]   And so basically, the witch doctor was king in every tribe, in every village.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.660]   That witch doctor had power.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:18.660]   But when the gospel went into those countries, a lot of that belief in the witch doctor's
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.260]   power actually got transferred over to the pastor.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:28.460]   So there is now a lot of abuse in our African countries where the pastor actually is just
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.980]   spouting off a lot of false teaching.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.340]   And so you have a lot of pastors in a lot of these underdeveloped countries who were
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.900]   not educated even just like human...
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.420]   Like not humanly.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.340]   They don't have beyond maybe even a junior high education.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:50.180]   So there is a great need for people like you and myself to go to the field to educate the
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:57.180]   locals, not to go and make converts, but to go and train up the pastors in order so that
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.020]   they could reach and educate.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.020]   So there's a lot of drifting because of a lack of knowledge.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.860]   Us, it's not so much a lack of knowledge, it's deliberate ignorance that causes our
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.860]   drifting.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:15.180]   I don't know if that's adequately answering your question, but that's what I've seen.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.180]   Culture everywhere.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.260]   I mean, this is a spiritual battle.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.880]   But for us, I feel like here in a first world country, the battle is...
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.820]   Like Satan, one of his ploys is to make it seem like there is no battle.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.640]   And then we end up kind of...
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.980]   You know that we have a seminar coming up called Lard Mines, right?
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.300]   Some people got confused.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.940]   So some things it's published or it's put up as landmines, some things are lard mines,
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.540]   but I did lard mines on purpose.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.540]   It's stuff that fattens us to death, okay?
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.140]   And that's the danger in Orange County.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:55.740]   But in other countries, a lot of it is just lack of teaching where there's no persecution.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:01.860]   Persecution, a lot of times the churches thrive because their loyalty to Christ is tested
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.740]   and they stay true.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:19.100]   But in terms of drifting, that's kind of the cause, just ignorance.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.740]   My time in China, why I decided to go, and my role currently.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.740]   Okay.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:38.940]   I mean, this is good for us because, you know, I'm the shepherd over the bam, so for you
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.620]   guys to get to know who I am a little bit.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.120]   I had no intention of doing anything missional.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.600]   I mean, in the sense of like going overseas.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:57.180]   I had told my wife in 2003 when we just were about to start dating, "Hey, if God calls
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.400]   us to China, I'm ready to go."
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.900]   So she's like, "Yeah, it'll never happen, but we could work out maybe."
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.900]   So we're like, "Great."
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.900]   So it worked out.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:12.640]   2008, we both, or 2007, right after we got married, we had a summer send-off team.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.700]   And then we were at Turtle Rock Community Park, and we both sat there listening to just
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.500]   the testimonies that were shared and then praying over our summer team.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.740]   We're like, "You know what?
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   Next year we should go."
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.140]   And then while we were driving home, we both said that at the same time.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.540]   "I think next year we should go."
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.980]   2008, we went.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:34.020]   And as we were walking from, there's a mall, and we're walking to our hotel, which is this
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:40.220]   ghetto motel, but we were walking there, and Becky says, "Huh, if God were to call us here,
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.220]   I think it'd be okay."
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.400]   She doesn't remember this, but I was like, "That's a sign."
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.140]   So then I came back and I told Pastor Peter, "Oh, Becky said this."
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.180]   He's like, "Would you guys consider going for a year next year?"
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:56.460]   Because we had been baton passing one-year projects from our members for about three,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.700]   four years.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.860]   I think Kevin was on that, he was that first baton.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.580]   But the church was like, "We actually need more spiritual leadership there, one.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.900]   Two, we need an English business there, okay, so that we can get visas."
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   And this is 2009.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.700]   So I went out with Becky, and then we had a couple more people join our team.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.460]   Jane Tang actually was on that team back in 2009.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.460]   It was supposed to be for one year with the sole purpose of getting visas ready, getting
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:29.220]   our English camps running, and then providing stability.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:36.540]   Well, we, as soon as we got there, I was like, "You know how hard it is to get a visa, like
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.220]   a business?
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.660]   And one year is way too short.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.860]   You know, when you think a one-year abroad, you think it's a long time.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.260]   No, no, when you're thinking to bear fruit, I was like, "One year is way too short."
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.020]   So six months in, Pastor Peter came for the winner, and I said, "You know, I think one
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.020]   year is too short.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.580]   We'll extend it two more years.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.460]   But if we do extend it two more years, let me get into the underground church so I could
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.060]   teach Old Testament survey, I could teach New Testament survey, I could teach Greek.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.260]   Let me get in there and let me teach."
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.360]   He's like, "Okay, that's great for you, but what's the rest of our church gonna do?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.620]   But we'll wait on you."
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.460]   So after two years extended, by the end of our third year, I was like, "You know, if
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.580]   we keep making plans to leave, we're not gonna bear any fruit."
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.380]   Because like I shared, the command is to go.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.040]   I should really be wrestling with the call to stay.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.020]   So we said, "Rest of our lives, we're here until God tells us otherwise.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.020]   I'm good with languages, and I'm already there, might as well."
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.500]   So we decided to stay long-term.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.980]   And then I was miserable because we decided to stay there long-term.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.860]   I was like, "God, I committed to stay there long-term.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:39.820]   It was my, you know, my choice, but I'm so scared.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.620]   I'm so like unhappy because I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:50.200]   I work hard, but I feel like I'm just running on a, like a hamster wheel.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.080]   We're not getting anything done."
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   And then he put on my heart a call to children.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.720]   And that was, that may be the only time ever that I've heard God's audible voice.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.600]   "You need to champion the cause of children."
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.640]   I said, "Okay, China it is, China orphans."
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.560]   So I actually was exploring.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.640]   We had a disabled, and some of you guys have been there, like special needs orphanage,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.760]   because there's one child policy, a lot of children get thrown away.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.280]   So we explored some of that.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.840]   I was trying to think of how to, you know, minister to migrant workers' children.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.360]   But I've been a Compassion International sponsor since 1997.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:33.280]   And at that time, we were celebrating our five-year anniversary, and I went on a trip
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.060]   to the Philippines with Compassion Korea.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.080]   But it happened just at that same moment that Compassion blew up in Korea, because one
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.200]   of our famous celebrities came and just shared about Compassion.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.520]   And the inventory, we ran out of children, 25,000 children, boom, gone.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.900]   So now they had a crazy budget.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.560]   But it happened that the CEO was on that flight.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:01.360]   So, well, and the CEO is my cousin, but he never travels with these teams, but he just
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   happened to be on that flight going somewhere else.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.120]   So he's like, "Let's meet up."
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.600]   And then we met up, and I was sharing with him, "How do I do all of this Compassion
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.080]   kind of stuff in China?"
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.560]   He said, "You can't, because the church doesn't have the freedom to move in China.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.120]   Why don't you come to Korea?"
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.840]   And I was like, "I just literally three weeks ago told our church, 'Get behind us.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   Get on my shoulders.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.160]   We're going to go into China.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.640]   How am I going to do this?'"
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.880]   So I called Pastor Peter.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.260]   He actually said, "It's a better fit for you to go to Korea."
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.800]   So then we immigrated again, long-term, to Korea.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.240]   And for the last six years, for you guys who don't know what I did, my job was to basically
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:47.880]   vision cast, raise money, and then just take a bunch of people one week at a time or two
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.760]   weeks to different countries to show them Compassion's ministry, to show them the role
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.360]   of the local church in the universal church.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.040]   And that was my job.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.320]   And so I came back here.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.920]   What is my role in the Great Commission now?
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.160]   Was that latter part of your question.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.400]   It's to preach the gospel, to teach the word.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.320]   I still consider myself a missionary, though I'm not in a different context.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.560]   But more than helping the poor, I think people have...
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.000]   A lot of people ask me, "What is your take on the social justice stuff?"
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.860]   You know, like that happened a few months ago.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.800]   So a couple people asked me like, "Hey, are you for like all of the social justice that's
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   happening?"
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   I go, "No."
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.580]   The church's main objective is to preach the gospel against sin and to accurately handle
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.640]   God's word.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.480]   But if God's word is accurately handled, social justice is the natural byproduct, but you
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.320]   cannot make social justice the chief objective of the church.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.160]   The chief objective of the church is worship and accurately representing God through His
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160]   word.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.600]   And so I feel like I'm doing that, not perfectly.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   But my job right now is just to basically bear fruit wherever I'm planted.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.800]   Be here five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, nor is there for you.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.960]   Every time I've made a plan, God's changed it, so I've stopped.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   I never plan to go to China.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.200]   I never plan to go to China, then Korea.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.960]   But then it timed it where right when I went to China, North Korea opened up our compassion
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.020]   ministry.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.480]   And we spent $200,000 investing into 41 orphanages to send blankets into all of them.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.640]   And you know who the only person was that could read Chinese and was a US citizen that
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   was in Compassion Korea?
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.800]   I was only one.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.720]   So at the time, God just kind of moved me there.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.980]   And I shared this with you before.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:35.500]   In North Korea, I happened to just meet this lady and I bring up this topic of I met twin
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.700]   brothers when I was in Beijing.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.020]   And these twin brothers actually happened to be her nephews and she let me take pictures
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.100]   and videos of everything and let me walk out of there with eight gigs.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.020]   And she actually hugged me at Pyongyang Airport and said, "Go now."
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.020]   And I just walked out.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.900]   And I didn't think anything of it until afterward.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.820]   And then afterward, I was like, "I could have been on the news.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:55.820]   That could have been bad stuff.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.420]   I would be dead walking out with eight gigs of sensitive material."
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.260]   But she let me do that.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.340]   So I don't really care where I'm at.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.180]   Wherever I'm at, that's where God desires for me to be.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.740]   And it's just to preach His Word, all of it, not just one aspect of it.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.220]   And poverty alleviation is one aspect of it, although it's a big one.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.540]   So my role in the Great Commission is basically to equip the saints to carry on the Great
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.740]   Commission.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.740]   What is the Great Commission?
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.740]   Go into all the nations and baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and the
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.460]   Holy Spirit, teaching them to do everything I command you and I'm with you to the end
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   of the age.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.100]   But the only verb in that whole command is make disciples.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.140]   Everything else are attendant participles.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.020]   Going, baptizing, teaching.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.940]   So my job is to just baptize and teach wherever I'm at.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.020]   So that's my role.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.020]   Maybe one or two more.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.980]   And some of you guys are falling asleep, so I'll take it easy on you guys.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.460]   Holy is not uninteresting.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.460]   Okay?
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.460]   Anybody else?
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:06.300]   Or I could go to these.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.660]   Does believing the existence of hell affect your salvation was a question.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:16.980]   Does believing the existence of hell affect your salvation?
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:30.640]   I don't necessarily see hell as a place as much as I see it as a full, unbridled pouring
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.940]   out of God's wrath.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.820]   God is omnipresent.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:42.940]   He's in heaven and he is perhaps in hell in the form of his wrath, in the form of his
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.920]   justice, in the form of his judgment.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.060]   People sometimes say, "Well, isn't hell where God is like separation from God?"
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   Yes and no.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.140]   You're separating yourself from God's grace, his goodness.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.980]   But in Sheol, in hell, that's a full outpouring of the wrath of God.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:04.900]   So we don't know if it's necessarily down or if it's like, it's difficult because there's
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.340]   a lot of imagery involved.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.460]   And the only use of really fire is kind of in the book of Revelation.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.020]   There isn't too much on hell.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.680]   So believing in it is biblical.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.960]   But believing in what it is, it's open to, I think, opinion.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.460]   Recently Ben Shapiro came on a talk saying he doesn't believe.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.860]   John MacArthur and Ben Shapiro had a, it wasn't a debate because they're very respectful to
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.940]   each other, but he says he doesn't believe in hell, I think, because it's not in the
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.260]   scriptures.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.800]   But that's why I say I don't know necessarily if it's a place.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.780]   Like heaven for me is not a place, even though there's a lot of imagery of a place.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.680]   It is in the presence of God and I can see it in face to face.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.980]   That's what I believe that to be.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.620]   Are you guys following my train of thought?
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.900]   Because there are things, there's so much imagery that I don't know exactly what is
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.820]   like exact or literal.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:06.980]   But believing in the existence of judgment and wrath is biblical.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.000]   But I want to do a little follow up.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.280]   If you engage in spiritual warfare, how do you handle demonic influences?
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Do you talk to them?
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.480]   Do you command them?
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.960]   Because charismatic circles, a lot of times they tell you to command the demons to chase
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.880]   them out, right?
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.800]   One thing is Satan's smarter than you.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.000]   Satan probably knows a Bible better than you and that's something you want to be very careful
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   of.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.240]   Jude verse 9, it says, "Even the archangel Michael."
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.980]   How many of you guys have read the book of Jude before?
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.800]   Even the archangel Michael is very careful when they're arguing with the body of Moses.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.100]   Now that's a completely different thing.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.740]   But they're arguing over what to do with Moses' body, Michael and Satan, okay?
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:54.400]   But even the archangel Michael was reluctant to make a proclamation against Satan, but
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.940]   rather said, "The Lord rebuke you."
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:03.280]   So when it comes to demonic forces, we're called to sometimes resist, we're sometimes
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:10.520]   called to flee, we're sometimes called to like stand our ground and take up the shield
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.260]   of faith and extinguish the fires.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.420]   We're never called to command Satan or the demons to do this or that.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.580]   You guys following me?
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.620]   In the book of Acts, they actually, there's seven sons of Sceva, they try to do this and
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.740]   what happened?
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   They got possessed.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.620]   Okay, I know Jesus, I know this Paul, but who are you?
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:34.560]   So that's something that I just added it on.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.520]   Hopefully not to your boredom.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   Anybody else?
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.720]   One last question and then we'll put you out of your misery.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:55.840]   Yes, let's see.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.020]   That's a very important question.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:05.160]   How do I discern a passion for overseas work as a call to missions?
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.600]   That's a good question, right?
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.500]   So again, what is the main call that you have?
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.360]   It's to make disciples wherever you're at.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:21.120]   And I would say with the 12 apostles before, including Matthias, excluding Apostle Paul,
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.240]   and then not including Judas as an apostle.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:29.360]   So those 12, all of their ministries was to, you guys know where all of the ministry was
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.360]   to?
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.280]   It was all to the Jews.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   It was not to the Gentiles.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.520]   And even for the Apostle Paul, the first 13 years of his ministry was to the Jews.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:47.000]   And Paul actually gets commissioned to the Gentiles because his citizenship, his ability
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.760]   to, he was very educated.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:56.080]   So his ability to contextualize this gospel to both the Jewish culture and the pagan culture,
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.000]   the Gentile culture, right?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.120]   He could do that all.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.500]   And so he was the best person to go.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:13.000]   So if you are zero gifted, like zero gifted in terms of language, don't go.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.040]   Okay?
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:22.760]   If you have no love for people, don't go.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:29.920]   If you have too much debt and you have family members who are sick and in need of your care,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.360]   don't go.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:38.320]   So there are a lot of circumstantial things that kind of have to line up for you to be
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.640]   useful in the field.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:46.960]   So one thing that I have to, like, so I would, I talked to, so in China, I was teaching a
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:52.320]   seminary class and that whole class, 16 students, none of them went to high school.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.520]   They all only went to junior high.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.040]   And the pastor was instilling in them a vision for Africa.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.640]   So all of them were like, "I want to go to Africa.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   I want to go to Africa."
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.720]   And I said, "Why?"
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:10.160]   First of all, you're not going to get a passport.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   Right?
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.320]   Because usually to get a passport from a third world, if you're a third world country member,
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.960]   you have to have a reason.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.480]   Second, when you go there, you can't even speak English.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.280]   Because I'm trying to teach them English.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.880]   What are you going to do there?
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.160]   And how long is it going to take you to speak Lugandan or Swahili?
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   How long is it going to take you?
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.920]   15 years?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.400]   And then how long is it going to take you to actually adapt to their culture?
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.000]   Don't go.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.120]   I would actually have you go back to your countryside and share the gospel there.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.800]   Because the countryside in China is dying because all the young people are gone.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.840]   Koreans are very mission-minded in South Korea.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.080]   I'm like, "Why do you guys keep thinking of Africa?
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.120]   Because it's sexy.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.040]   I want to go to the remotest part of the world."
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   Right?
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040]   Why?
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.920]   The farther you go, the more money it costs to take you there, the more lonely you'll
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.320]   get, the more likely to get depressed you'll be, and then the more likely it is you'll
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.720]   come back before you can be any kind of fruitful.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.960]   I said, "North Korea is in great need of missionaries.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.560]   And you guys are Korean ethnically.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.360]   You can speak the language, and you can just go, 'boop,' and come back the same day.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   Go up and come back.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   Up and down.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   Up and down.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   It's a small country.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.040]   So, be passionate about North Korea rather than the remotest parts of the world."
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.280]   Because human nature is we want to be the one who goes to the remotest parts of the
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   world.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.520]   Would you guys agree with this?
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.680]   If I were to say, "I want to be a missionary," to where?
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.680]   Tijuana.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.560]   People would be like, "Why?"
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   Right?
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.800]   Because it just doesn't seem like all that appealing or sexy.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.160]   So to answer your question, let's see, I would say this.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.120]   How God created you is not a mistake.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.360]   Ethnic makeup, ability, okay?
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.920]   Background.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.400]   All of that is on purpose.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.960]   Your job.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.840]   And how God created you and how He's thus far led and equipped you, He wants to use
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.960]   you.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:24.320]   And then if He propels you somewhere else, you go, "Hallelujah," and you go.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:30.800]   But you bloom where you're planted and then if He pushes you out, you bloom there too.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.680]   You guys, Acts 8, verse 1.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.640]   So Saul was in hearty agreement putting Stephen to death.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:46.800]   And that day, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:52.720]   And they were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.040]   And they were all scattered except the apostles.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.360]   So how did the gospel first get spread to Judea and Samaria and the beginning parts
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   of the ends of the world?
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   Persecution.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.800]   Did they plan it?
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.620]   No, they got shipped out.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.480]   You don't plan a calling.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.560]   You guys follow me?
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.560]   You are faithful to your task and when God wants to make it clear, He will make it clear.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.600]   But are you supposed to have a heart for the nations?
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   Absolutely.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:28.280]   But your heart for the nations shall never supersede your passion for His Word.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:36.200]   But as your passion for His Word affects your heart for the nations, then He will send you
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.120]   where you need to be.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.840]   And that might not be to the places where we think are the most sexy.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.320]   You know, I'll just end with this.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.320]   This will be my last thing.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   And then if you have other questions, you can ask me later.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.080]   2002, I was at a church called Good Shepherd Korean Presbyterian Church in Roland Heights.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.160]   And that summer, we went to Arizona for the Native American missions, okay?
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.240]   And we've had it all over the bands.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.480]   Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church Native American missions.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.060]   And so we were there.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.960]   And then I think we passed by like somewhere near Las Vegas.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.400]   We stopped for gas and stuff.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.040]   At that same gas station, there was a Korean church from Arizona that said, "Los Angeles
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.160]   homeless rescue."
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:25.660]   And for some reason, more than thinking it was comical, it disturbed me.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.660]   We have 40 people.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.740]   And this was during the World Cup.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:32.440]   So they actually took their TVs because Korea, that's when they advance far.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.400]   We have 40 adults from our church in like six cars going to Arizona to do one week of
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.320]   mission work.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:47.680]   And then you had two bands there from Arizona going to LA to do mission work.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.280]   And can you guys guess what I was thinking?
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.160]   You probably can guess what I was thinking.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.960]   It would have been better if we just went to LA.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.520]   Because let's say somebody comes to Christ.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   We could follow up.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:06.000]   They should just stay in the Native American area because they can follow up.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   But we're doing this because missions is far away.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.600]   And missions is where you go to sometimes get saved.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.920]   So you send a lot of non-Christians to the mission field.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.640]   So to your question, how should I take my passion?
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.880]   Can I interpret it as a calling?
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.120]   Yes and no.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.720]   Your passion for the nations, you and I all have to have a passion for the nations.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.760]   And every single person has to have a heart for the nations.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.840]   I have zero heart for China or North Korea.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.480]   I have strong interests in those countries because I've been there, I have vested interest,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.080]   and I have friends in both.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.320]   But I don't really, you know, some people say, you just say North and they're like,
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320]   they start crying.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.560]   China, and then they just, because they have such a tender heart for that.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.120]   For me, that's not the case.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.320]   For me, it's abused children.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.240]   When I see abused children, I get a choking.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.120]   But I have a vested interest in those countries.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:08.880]   And so the heart for the nations has to be under the heart for the Word of God and love
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.200]   for God.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.240]   And then He will move you in His time.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.060]   Only one of the apostles really was a missionary abroad.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.280]   Everyone else was ministering in their local context.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.520]   And look what happens to the gospel, it's spread all over the world.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.680]   It's a baton passing.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:31.000]   It's not a call for you to go to the other side of the planet.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.120]   It could happen, and I hope it happens, but our plan should be to go where I will bear
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.840]   the most fruit.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.720]   So right now, you're planted in your families, you're planted in your careers, you're planted
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.080]   at your schools, you're planted at our church, you're planted in our community.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.520]   Bloom here, and then God will move you, and then you'll bloom there.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.640]   You can't not bloom here and then try to bloom over in a different culture context.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.520]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:02.000]   God's Word first, passion for the nation second, my role third.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.720]   And then you just go from that.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.760]   And then for specific calling to different places, God makes it clear.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.240]   I absolutely believe that with all my heart.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.600]   And until He makes it clear, just be faithful.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.320]   Okay, I'm done.
