[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   So, let's look at our passage for today.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.780]   If you would turn in your Bibles to chapter 10 of 1 Corinthians, and we're reading from
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.200]   verse 23 down to verse 33, okay?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.520]   So chapter 10, verse 23, down to verse 33.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.640]   And this is what it says, "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.040]   All things are lawful, but not all things edify.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.560]   Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.800]   Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience sake.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.720]   For the earth is the Lord's and all it contains.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.520]   If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.800]   you without asking questions for conscience sake.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.000]   But if anyone says to you, 'This is meat sacrificed to idols,' then do not eat it.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.440]   For the sake of the one who informed you and for conscience sake.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.720]   I mean not your own conscience, but the other man's.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.360]   For why is my freedom judged by another's conscience?
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.320]   If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.920]   Whether then you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all for the glory of God.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.480]   Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.920]   But as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.720]   of the many so that they may be saved."
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.200]   All right, let's take a moment to pray and then we'll jump into the text.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.680]   Father God, we truly want to thank you for the word.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.360]   God help us to be a people who are hungry for your truth.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.080]   Hungry God, knowing that we need your guidance, we need your nourishment.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.240]   And Father, as you are directing the church on how to behave in relationship to other
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.440]   brothers and other sisters, I pray Father God that you grant us wisdom.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   Lord, thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.480]   So this is like a great kind of conclusion to a long segment.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.800]   For those of you guys, there's no table seating, so just sit anywhere you want, okay?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.960]   This is a kind of a long drawn out section that is now coming to a little bit of a conclusion.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.880]   It began in chapter eight, okay?
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.840]   And remember, I mentioned earlier that it's talking about Christian liberty.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.520]   And the way I would like to summarize that chapter eight till 11 verse one is really
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.680]   knowing the difference between right and wrong.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.380]   So I left a blank for you there, knowing the difference between right and wrong.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.740]   But if you guys would, in your blank, write dot dot dot, or what's best.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.160]   So it's knowing the difference between right and wrong, dot dot dot, or what's best.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   And it took me a long time to think about that little heading.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.800]   But what I see as, again, a huge benefit to the book of First Corinthians is it is truly
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.080]   a wisdom book teaching you how to decide.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.980]   And if you take a look at verses 23 to 24, it says, "All things are lawful, but not
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.400]   all things are profitable.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   All things are lawful, but not all things edify."
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.640]   And that really sends us back to chapter six, which when I taught that lesson, I introduced
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.020]   as a wisdom text, teaching you not simply to decide, hey, what's right and wrong, but
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.440]   teaching you to decide what's best.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.900]   Because you're asking the question, what is profitable?
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.300]   Not just what's lawful, but what's really profitable?
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.880]   And so, perhaps the people at the Church of Corinth wrote a letter to the Apostle Paul
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.080]   saying, "So what do we do about this disagreement we have?
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.300]   You got a bunch of people saying, 'We can't touch that meat because it's been offered
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.260]   to idols and it's been sacrificed and it will be unholy.'
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.220]   And then they're wrestling, like, 'Oh, but I want to, but I don't want to, and there's
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.060]   a lot of reasons to want to, and then there's a lot of reasons to not want to.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.060]   I don't know what to do.'
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.020]   And then there's a bunch of people who are saying, 'Dude, it's nothing.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   Just eat it.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.600]   What do we do about this disagreement?'
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.420]   Maybe it was a simple question, but they just got an earful from Apostle Paul, from chapter
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.820]   eight to chapter 10, chapter 11, verse one.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.600]   Now what's really interesting about this concluding remark, okay?
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   So this is a concluding section, is that I feel like Apostle Paul goes back and forth.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.300]   If you read verses 23 and 24, essentially what he's saying is, "Don't eat it."
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300]   Right?
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.700]   I mean, he's saying, "Look, all things are lawful, not all things are profitable, all
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.640]   things are lawful, but not all things edify."
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.460]   So he says, "Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor."
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.420]   If you were to receive that after asking the question, "Hey, what should I do?"
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.660]   And you know, maybe it's your pastor or an older brother or sister, they're like, "Don't
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660]   be so selfish.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.660]   Don't look out for your own good.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.380]   Think about the other people."
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.380]   You would think, "Okay, fine.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.380]   I won't eat it.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.380]   Gosh."
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.540]   You know, like, that's the way you would respond probably, right?
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.660]   So what I'd like you to do in order to kind of get the point of what he's saying is, take
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.700]   a look at chapter six, verse 12, and tell me, by comparing contrast, what is he getting
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.700]   at here?
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.060]   What do you see as a difference between what he's saying back in chapter six when he wanted
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.940]   the church to be wise, versus here in chapter 10 when he wants the church to be wise?
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.140]   So I'll read the passage for us, chapter six, verse 12.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.700]   "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable."
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.060]   Hmm, sounds like the same thing.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.500]   "All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything."
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.820]   Okay.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:03.620]   My question to you guys is, it sounds like the same thing, but there's obviously a difference,
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.420]   and the difference is obvious, but why that difference?
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:16.420]   "Isn't 6.12 talking about what's good for me, and this is talking about what's good
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.980]   for someone else?"
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.980]   Excellent.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.980]   Okay.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.740]   So in the context of chapter six, he's talking a lot about your own self-control, and it's
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.540]   in the context when he recently, or really closely in proximity, talked about sexual
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.220]   morality.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.260]   So you are having a control over your own flesh.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.380]   But then here in chapter 10, he wants you to think outside your box, and to think about
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.820]   other people.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.300]   And what he says is, "Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor."
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.620]   Okay?
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.660]   So there's your point that he really wants you to get at, okay?
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:00.260]   Now, if you were to highlight, or circle, in that little phrase, "Let no one seek his
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:11.300]   own good, but that of his neighbor," what would you circle as the command?
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.220]   And I know it's kind of like, "What are you really asking here?
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.260]   It's really obvious what the command is."
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.620]   Well, I want to make a point from it, and I didn't know how else to get at it.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.340]   Here's the obvious question, what's the command?
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.940]   So someone volunteer and tell me what you circled.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.460]   What would you circle as the command?
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.460]   "Seek."
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.460]   Excellent.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.180]   Okay, seek.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.220]   Sometimes you see things in the negative form, "Hey, don't do this."
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.220]   Okay?
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.660]   And then sometimes you see things in the positive form, "Do this."
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:55.660]   When I first read this passage in, you know, verse 24, I just underlined, "Hey, don't seek
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.100]   your own good."
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.780]   So essentially what that's telling you is, "Hey, don't be selfish."
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.780]   Right?
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.180]   Well, let's think of a hypothetical scenario, and I want to make the point that if you were
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.020]   to leave it at that and say, "Hey, don't be selfish," that would not really capture what
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.100]   Apostle Paul expects.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.540]   Okay?
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.300]   So let's all think of a hypothetical scenario where you have three friends.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.100]   I try to pick names that, you know, nobody shares the name in this room.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.660]   First person, Lawrence.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.700]   Lawrence wants to go eat with his buddies and says, "Hey, I feel like Mexican food today."
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.060]   But Rebecca is like, "Oh, I don't know.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.300]   I was feeling like Korean today."
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.140]   But then Lydia was like, "Oh, but I had Korean yesterday."
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.140]   Okay.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.140]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.600]   You got three people who want different things.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.700]   If you were to obey the command of, "Hey, let no one seek his own good," in the negative
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.700]   form, what would you do?
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.700]   What?
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700]   Get chicken?
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700]   Is that what you said?
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   Get fusion.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700]   Urban soul.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.700]   Okay.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:05.580]   I guess that's one thing you can do.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.820]   Stop messing up my analogy, all right?
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.200]   But I think a lot of times what I find people do is to say like, "Okay, then let's just
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   do what you want."
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.660]   Right?
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:24.400]   Sometimes what I find like option A is just scenarios like this have happened, okay?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.300]   Three friends get together and they want to go out to eat and then everyone says something
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.660]   different and then so there's this like, "So, do, do, do."
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.700]   And then there's this awkward silence because everyone's kind of waiting for someone to
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.820]   say something.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.640]   That's option A. Okay?
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.520]   Option A is to not say anything and let it be awkward.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   Option B is to say, "Okay, fine.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.140]   Let's just do what you want."
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.140]   Right?
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:52.060]   And the reason why I say that's not sufficient because to say whatever, "I guess I'm okay
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.900]   with Korean," is actually not what Apostle Paul is expecting.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.900]   Why do I say that?
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:05.980]   It's because, let me suggest an option C. Option C is for one person who perhaps is
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.100]   thinking of this scenario and really has the heart that exemplifies what Apostle Paul says,
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.020]   "Let no one seek his own good but that of his neighbor," and becomes what I like to
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.100]   call the considerate initiator.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.100]   Okay?
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.420]   The considerate initiator.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.540]   And let's say it's Rebecca and Rebecca says, "All right, let's go Chipotle."
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.660]   It's like, "That's Mexican food."
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.260]   I guess you'd call it like, you know, Americanized Mexican food, right?
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.780]   Well, the thing about that is she didn't say, "Hey, whatever.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.900]   I'm okay with it," but what she said was, "I suggest."
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.820]   Here's an option that I know pleases you, but I'm suggesting it.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.420]   It's very different from saying, "Hey, whatever.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.180]   I can do what you want."
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.540]   Why do I say that?
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:56.100]   It's because when you say something to the extent of, "Hey, like, I'm okay with it, but
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.220]   as long as you want it, sure," what ends up happening is the person who says, "Yeah, I
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.860]   want Mexican," they end up feeling selfish.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.700]   And so I'm not sure if you guys have ever experienced a scenario with your friend or
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.060]   a scenario with your spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever it may be.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.460]   And guys, this is free advice for you.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:20.020]   If you say whatever you decide, you are already lost.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.340]   Even if she gets in the end what she wants, you lose.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.340]   You do.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.060]   Because it seems like either you don't care, it seems like secretly you want something,
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.140]   but you're not willing to say it, which now you've lost your pants.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.540]   The other thing that happens is if you say whatever, you know what I'm saying, right?
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.740]   It's just a no-win situation when you do that.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:45.420]   But if you become a considerate initiator, you say, "Okay, you're choosing something,
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.260]   and rather than choosing, like right now, Bea and I, we moved into our home, and I could
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.300]   have decided I want to decorate my house with masculine things.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.480]   Everything needs to be gray and navy blue, right?
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.640]   But if I chose to decide to become a considerate initiator and pick the thing that I know she's
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:11.680]   delighted by, now I've done way more, way more than just I'm not being selfish."
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.080]   Why am I making a point of this?
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.720]   That's not even a biblical scenario.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.000]   This is just like scenarios of this and that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.680]   It's because if you read the passage as, "Let no one seek his own good and stop there,"
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.080]   you're not getting his point.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:35.000]   Because if you put that into the right circles, it should be, "Seek the good of his neighbor,"
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.160]   right?
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.200]   And that is so much more than just simply stop being selfish.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.840]   And I want to ask you the question, are you being characterized by not just simply, "Let
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   the people have their way.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840]   Fine."
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.120]   Or are you going above and beyond that to, "Are you seeking what is profitable?
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.800]   Are you seeking what will edify?
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.440]   Are you really seeking that which is good for your neighbor?"
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.000]   Do you see the point that I'm making?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.160]   It is a go above and beyond what's minimal.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.040]   Go above and beyond, cease from your selfish ways to now seek what is actually in favor
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.840]   of your brother and sister in Christ.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.400]   That is very much so more than perhaps what we would think.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.600]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.080]   A biblical scenario more in tune with this is really, you know, let's say Wesley who
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.280]   is weak in conscience.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.480]   Wesley could ask stubborn Steve, "Hey, could you not eat that for me?
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.240]   Because I saw that offered in the temple.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.400]   Could you please not eat that?"
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.440]   I mean, in this scenario, Wesley could be the one to ask, right?
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.920]   But the thing about it is, if stubborn Steve had this attitude of like, "I'm going to eat
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.040]   until somebody asks," is he fulfilling what Apostle Paul is calling him to?
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.480]   Do you see my point?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.000]   The considerate initiator.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.120]   If he's in there, or if let's say, you know, Rebecca's in there like, "Yeah, I'm all Korean,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.800]   but if they ask, okay, I will."
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.960]   That's a completely different attitude of the heart.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.120]   And I think that's what I'm getting at here and I'm seeing is, if you're reading it one
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.240]   way, it's like, "I will fulfill this by doing the minimum."
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:23.080]   But the other part is, the considerate initiator would be the one who says, "Beyond that, I'll
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.960]   consider what's best for my neighbor."
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   Okay?
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   All right.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.240]   If you would, turn in your Bibles to Romans chapter 14, Romans chapter 14.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.940]   And this passage, I've referenced before, when I was preaching chapter 8, but realize
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.280]   that this scenario, not only is it common in the Church of Corinth, but this scenario
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.560]   is common all across the various churches.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.000]   And I mentioned how not only is it common, but it's something that probably came up in
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.440]   everyday life, especially in their context.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   But the principle behind it will actually show itself in our everyday context as well.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   Are you guys cold at all?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.160]   Sorry, I just got the shivers.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.280]   If you're cold, you guys can lower that thermostat.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.840]   If you're fine, I'm good.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   All right.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.200]   In Romans chapter, what did I say?
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   14, verse 13.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   Okay?
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   >> Is this the best?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   >> What?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   Are you going to be considered or not, dude?
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   I'm just kidding.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   I'm just kidding.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   No, it was honestly, I just wanted to see.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   >> I don't even know how I responded.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   >> What would Jesus do, Jason?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   What would Jesus do, Jason?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:50.960]   I'll let you work out your faith and fear and trembling over there.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   That's so funny.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   All right.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.920]   Verse 13 of chapter 14 in the book of Romans.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.720]   There's so much to glean from this passage.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.680]   And it says, "Therefore, let us not judge another anymore, but rather determine this,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.440]   not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in our brother's way.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.040]   I know and I'm convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but to
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.360]   him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.760]   For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.560]   Do not destroy with your food him from whom Christ died.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.680]   Therefore, do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.440]   For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.680]   Holy Spirit.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.880]   For he who is this way serves Christ in this way, serves Christ, is acceptable to God and
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.400]   approved by men.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.560]   So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.480]   Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.600]   All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives defense.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:07.440]   It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.160]   The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.560]   Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves, but he who doubts is condemned
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   if he eats because his eating is not from faith and whatever is not from faith is sin."
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560]   Okay.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.360]   Wow, that's a lot just packed in that paragraph, right?
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:35.280]   But for our purposes, I'm just highlighting the exhortation, right?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.400]   He essentially said, "Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor."
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.920]   In almost very similar context, Apostle Paul is addressing the same issue in the book of
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   Romans.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   Okay?
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.160]   All right.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.440]   Let's take a look at verse 25 through 27.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.320]   Shan, Keresi.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.280]   Welcome back and can you read verse 25 to 27?
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   Sorry?
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.400]   Oh, my bad.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   Back in first Corinthians.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   Yeah, first Corinthians chapter 10, 25 to 27.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   "If anything that is sold in the meat market, not asking questions, but consciously, for
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   the earth, for the Lord, and all it contains.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go eat at a set before you go
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   to bed, and you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   And if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   And if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   And if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   But if you don't want to go, you can go to the market and ask for a meal.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.700]   well as far as verse 23, 24, he essentially said,
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.660]   "Hey, can you please think about your brothers?
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.040]   "Don't eat it", kind of right?
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.460]   He didn't say don't eat it, but he says,
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.500]   you need to think about your neighbors
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.480]   and I would conclude, okay I'm not gonna eat it.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.660]   But then here he says, eat it, right?
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.300]   And you gotta ask, why?
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.540]   Why the flip flop and why go back and forth
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.220]   and what's going on?
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.720]   Well, notice the repetition here.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.480]   In the paragraph from verse 25 to 27,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.680]   what is the phrase that you see repeated?
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.800]   I'm asking for another, again, just observation question.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.200]   Please just yell it out.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.680]   One more time.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.200]   Okay, so eat anything is one.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.240]   For conscience sake is two, okay?
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.400]   All right, so eat anything for conscience sake.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.280]   It's like, mm, okay.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.640]   So he's saying, eat anything without asking questions
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.960]   for conscience sake.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.160]   So he repeats that essentially, that whole phrase twice.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.920]   Eat anything without asking questions
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.340]   for conscience sake twice, right?
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.960]   So that means in my mind, he's talking about
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.120]   two different scenarios.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.680]   One scenario is, you're at the meat market.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.540]   Another scenario is, you are at your friend's house.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.800]   Right?
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.960]   And the principle is, eat anything,
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.160]   don't ask any questions.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.800]   Do you find that kind of funny at all?
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.200]   I find it pretty hilarious.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.480]   I find it a little hilarious 'cause it's kind of like
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.240]   a don't ask, don't tell policy, right?
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.920]   It almost sounds like, I don't know,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.420]   doesn't that sound a little shady?
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.160]   Like, ignorance is bliss, I didn't know,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.920]   you know, like that kind of stuff.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.040]   And so my question to you would be,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.840]   all right, so the scenarios, there's two,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.800]   and then he says, eat anything that is sold
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.920]   in the marketplace, eat anything at your friend's house,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.680]   but then don't ask the question.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.520]   My question is, is this what I think it sounds like?
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.780]   Is it the same as a don't ask and don't tell policy?
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.080]   Think about it a little bit.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.240]   This one's a little bit harder question.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.500]   And if you say no, then I'm gonna ask you why.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:56.560]   What kind of principle is he thinking about?
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.400]   Okay.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.760]   And if it's not a, hey, don't ask, don't tell
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.560]   kind of stuff, then what is it?
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.880]   - I think it's not don't ask, don't tell.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.720]   - Okay.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.440]   - Understand that these things don't matter,
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.120]   so you don't need to ask.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.800]   But if somebody tells you, then it matters for them.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.240]   - Okay.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.760]   All right, did you guys hear what he said?
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   So it's kind of like, there is still a difference
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.400]   between for you, for them, right?
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.760]   For you, for them.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.280]   And the reason why that's there is because
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.200]   Apostle Paul in his mind knows that that's there.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.000]   If you take a peek over at the next verse, okay?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.300]   Verse 29, I mean not your conscience,
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.120]   but the other man's, okay?
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.560]   So you're peeking over at verse 29,
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.000]   it says I'm not in your conscience,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.040]   I'm conscience, their conscience, okay?
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   So, it is not a don't ask, don't tell policy, okay?
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:06.140]   It's more of a differentiating your conscience,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.640]   their conscience policy, okay?
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.040]   So why do I say that?
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   It's because for you, what exists is verse 26.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.080]   And I asked the question, how does verse 26
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.520]   support this policy of eating the market food
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.840]   without asking?
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.280]   Because the overarching truth that he quotes
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.120]   from Psalm 24, one, is basically the earth of the Lord's
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.240]   and all that it contains.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.160]   So even the, for me, what I believe,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.720]   the truth that I've come to know is,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.680]   even the food that's here before me,
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.320]   no matter who they offer it to,
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.600]   it doesn't belong to them.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.200]   I know that the idols are nothing,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.280]   and the food that's given is just food, right?
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.360]   And not only that, but other passages,
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.720]   Acts 10, verse 15, what God has cleansed,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   do not consider unholy.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.240]   First Timothy, whoa.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.680]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.320]   Okay, first time in.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.360]   Okay, First Timothy, I believe it's chapter four,
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.080]   verses three through five.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.200]   I think that's where I got it from.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.960]   It says basically, refuse the men who forbid marriage
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.400]   and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.720]   to be gratefully shared in by those who believe
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.560]   and know the truth.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.320]   Everything created by God is good,
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.960]   and nothing is to be rejected
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.920]   if it is received with gratitude,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   for it is sanctified by means of the word of God
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.640]   and prayer, right?
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.000]   So the truth that we know is that everything belongs to God,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.960]   and it's the poor's idea, so you can eat it.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   Why, because this is your conscience.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.200]   My conscience is actually still not ruled
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.640]   by the other person's conscience
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.400]   when it pertains to the food, okay?
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.360]   Now, it's gonna sound like you're splitting hair,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.120]   but essentially what David said was right.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.360]   There's still their conscience and my conscience,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.720]   but when it comes into effect about my conscience
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.400]   is the eating before this person's face.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.160]   If it's just me before the food, my conscience is clear.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.680]   When my conscience comes into line
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.320]   is my eating before the face of my brother, right?
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.760]   So there is a differentiation in the scenario.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.680]   He says in two scenarios, you can eat
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.960]   because all the food belongs to God,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.280]   but in the two scenarios, what comes into play
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.840]   is the other man's conscience.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.480]   So in order to kind of summarize this point real quick,
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.220]   I'm going to bring up a modern day thing.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.560]   Did you know that a famous restaurant,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.960]   I can't say it's a restaurant,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.400]   but in New York they have a thing called a Halal Guys.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.520]   Have you guys heard of that?
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.600]   No?
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.060]   Yes, did you know it's coming right here?
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.600]   Right off of Bristol and Paul Arena,
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.080]   there's a little shopping plaza,
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.920]   Premistry is coming in there,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   and then there's like the Halal Guys coming in there,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   there's this like world renowned Japanese ramen place
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.420]   that's coming in there.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.520]   It's pretty cool, okay?
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.600]   But then what's really interesting is,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.540]   the reason why this topic came up
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.160]   is 'cause I met a brother at church at a restaurant,
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.840]   and on the menu they had Halal food.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.680]   And I said, "That's so funny,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.280]   "I thought that was the name of the restaurant."
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.800]   And then so we Googled it.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.880]   And so for those of you guys who are really excited
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.840]   for this Halal God thing,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.480]   I'm gonna ruin it for you right now.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.600]   If you guys have never heard of what is Halal,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   Halal is actually a Muslim term, okay?
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.720]   It's an Islamic term.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.640]   So Muslim is the people, Islam is the religion.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.240]   It literally means lawful,
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.640]   and it means lawful under the Quran, okay?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.920]   And the reason why they care about this
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.760]   is because underneath the Quran,
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.720]   you have to have the right kind of animal,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.040]   you have to slaughter it the right way,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   and then you have to prepare the food the right way.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.480]   And the thing about it is, underneath that law,
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.000]   they have restrictions in the kind of animal,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.880]   it cannot be a carnivore.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.960]   And then secondly, it has to be slaughtered
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.800]   in a way that's as painless as possible to the animal.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.360]   And the preparation has to be,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.240]   you can't just take a dead animal
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.320]   that's been dead for a while and do it.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.260]   You have to actually invoke the name of God,
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.840]   and soon after it's been slaughtered,
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.680]   you have to prepare it,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.040]   and it has to be prepared by somebody
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.080]   who has been sanctioned.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.040]   What's really interesting about that is
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.200]   the Quran allows Christians and Jews to prepare that food,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.560]   because Christians and Jews are monotheistic,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.640]   and they're scripturistic,
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.960]   meaning they have scripture text to abide by, right?
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.040]   Which I think is kind of funny,
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.400]   because they look down on the, anyway.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.280]   The thing about the whole thing is,
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.040]   I got bothered when, down the line,
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.720]   the food's coming out, smells really good,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.680]   it's right underneath me,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.520]   and I've got this Google thing coming up,
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.240]   and it says, "In the preparation,
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.480]   "you have to invoke the name of Allah."
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.680]   And I went, "Ugh."
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.800]   (laughing)
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.640]   Right?
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.320]   The smell is coming up.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.400]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.740]   Do I eat it or not eat it?
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.440]   According to verse 25 to 27,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.800]   do I eat it or not eat it?
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.040]   (laughing)
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.880]   Huh?
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.320]   I don't know, what do you guys say?
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.680]   Do I eat it or not eat it?
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.320]   - It doesn't apply to your conscience.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.580]   (laughing)
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.080]   - I don't know, what else do you guys think?
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.680]   You guys, should I eat it or not eat it,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.040]   after reading all that?
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.560]   So I didn't, huh?
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.400]   Ruined it?
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.240]   I know, totally ruined it.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   Well, the other reason why that came up is because, yeah,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.640]   the term actually is not just referring to food.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.040]   Muslims will call certain things halal,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.560]   as in, it's just lawful.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.840]   So know that that's what the term means, okay?
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.680]   Yes?
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.960]   - Similar to kosher, Jewish people,
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.560]   this time of year, they have to kill the animals.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.200]   - Uh-huh.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.840]   Yeah, so kosher food also, you're right, is strict.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.000]   - Less by the law.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.800]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.560]   Kosher too is dietary restriction based on Jewish law.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.400]   Okay?
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.440]   Man, kosher beef hot dogs are good though.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.680]   (laughing)
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.120]   Okay, so any other thoughts?
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.160]   He's the only one with an opinion.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.440]   Do I eat it or not eat it?
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.680]   You guys are all like, dude, it's coming,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.920]   don't ruin this for us.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.360]   (laughing)
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.760]   Okay, I ate it, all right?
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.600]   I ate it.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.960]   (laughing)
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.920]   This was in the past and I just ate it, okay?
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.120]   And failed, yeah.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.400]   (laughing)
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.320]   Okay, the reason why is because this is what I did.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   I asked the lady who worked there,
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.280]   oh, like, do you guys promote this, you know?
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.840]   And turned out the lady was Mediterranean
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.240]   and then the owner of the restaurant,
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.640]   you know, they just had that for people who came by.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.720]   So the restaurant was more Mediterranean
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.880]   than it was Muslim.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.280]   And in my mind, it's the whole idea
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.680]   of what does it identify with me?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.520]   Wait, does that make sense?
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.600]   What does it?
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.560]   What does it identify me with?
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.080]   So for example, if the Halal guys opened this thing up
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.440]   and they said, oh, we wanted to make sure
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   that we as a people who are Muslim have a restaurant.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.480]   If they had like, you know, certain things
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.800]   on the restaurant where essentially
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.240]   they were promoting their religion and faith, right?
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.680]   And they were really advocating this as like,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.040]   the success of our business is because Allah.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.520]   And that's the whole thing, right?
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.560]   Then I would have had crazy conflict of conscience,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.440]   I can't eat this.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.240]   Because that was their intent, right?
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.480]   But then in front of me, it's just kebabs and like rice,
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.320]   you know?
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   And the food was really good.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.000]   So I don't know if you guys agree with me
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.160]   on this point or not, but the thing is,
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.040]   I said grace, I thank God for the food,
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.640]   and I ate it because that was my conscience before the Lord.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   Right?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.520]   But if, again, the restaurant and what it stood
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.680]   as an institution was a promotion of who they were,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   and they were really like, hurrah, yeah,
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.360]   like we're succeeding in our business realm,
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.800]   we're gonna make a name for ourselves,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.480]   and I can't.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.360]   It's kind of a fine line, isn't it?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.200]   Right?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.840]   It's kind of a fine line.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.480]   But the thing about it,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   if, again, if the restaurant was just about like,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.760]   hey, we serve a bowl great for lunch, here it is.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.960]   That's one thing.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   If the restaurant was more like, this is who we are,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.520]   this is our identity, and this is why we make our food,
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.480]   that's a whole nother scenario.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.080]   Any thoughts about that?
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   Agree, disagree?
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.400]   Yes.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.520]   - I could share kind of a related story really quickly.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.200]   That we ended up kind of the other way.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.800]   We went to this sporting event
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.440]   that had Santa Claus,
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.040]   a person dressed as Santa Claus,
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.240]   connected to the event, and in the name of the event.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.000]   And we just went for the sports part.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.880]   But somebody else pointed out to us that,
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   well, you know, Santa Claus,
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   that's not what Christmas is about.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.120]   And it was clear that it really bothered them
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.680]   that we, it's not a Christian person,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.160]   it really bothered them that we would go
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.480]   to this sporting event that was connected to Santa Claus,
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.080]   even though we try to keep Santa Claus
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.560]   far away from what we do at Christmas.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.080]   So at first I was really annoyed,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   and my attitude was like, well, you know,
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.760]   if they have a problem with Santa Claus,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.400]   if they wanna keep Santa Claus
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.600]   that far away from their Christmas,
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.720]   that's fine for them, but I should be able
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.120]   to still go to this event and enjoy it.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.000]   And then I realized that this applies,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.640]   that if my doing hurts their conscience,
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.240]   probably this passage means they shouldn't participate
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.840]   and it's causing problems for them.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.280]   - Right, okay, good, thank you.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.560]   So, I appreciate that.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.680]   In me telling the story,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.400]   so you kinda have different stories here.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.640]   I'm actually not convincing you one way or the other.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.560]   You guys have to make your own decisions about it.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.360]   But here's the thing that I think
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.260]   is Apostle Paul's making a point here.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.960]   Verse 25 to 27, he says, "Eat anything that is sold
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.900]   "in the meat marketplace without asking questions
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.400]   "for conscience' sake."
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.240]   Okay?
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.200]   So, there's an element to which,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.840]   and I'm gonna talk about it a little bit more
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.680]   in the next section too,
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.600]   but there's an element to which,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.440]   coming back to the idea of the whole
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.480]   don't ask, don't tell question,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.520]   again, it's not that.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.720]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.860]   he is stating the fact that there is a liberty for us
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.840]   because everything in the world is the Lord's.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.920]   So, we have actually the freedom to eat it.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.160]   Right?
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.000]   So, that's actually one of his points here,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.240]   is you have the freedom to eat it
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.140]   because everything in the world is the Lord's.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.880]   But remember that the whole idea is
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.600]   that the other person's conscience can be involved.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.200]   So, his point here is don't involve his conscience.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.980]   Right?
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.440]   I don't know if that sounds weird to you guys,
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.960]   but that's what he's saying.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.400]   Don't ask the question because don't involve his conscience.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   And the thing about it is,
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.920]   if you do involve his conscience,
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.700]   then you gotta be willing to decline
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.440]   the exercise of your freedom
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.600]   for the sake of that person's conscience.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.840]   And that's when you are considering your neighbor.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.200]   Right?
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.640]   But aside from that,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.400]   we don't have to have legalistic standards,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.960]   we don't have to have a law outside of the law of the Bible
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.880]   and say, I can't eat anything that says the law,
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.160]   I can't eat anything that says this,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.040]   I can't eat anything.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.920]   That would be quite a standard above and beyond
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.400]   what the Bible says.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   Okay?
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.360]   Now, if somebody in here said,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.160]   yeah, but Pastor Mark,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.320]   now that you've explained that
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.720]   and then there's a whole idea of invoking the name of Allah
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.560]   and all that kind of stuff,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.160]   I don't wanna eat it.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   That's fine.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.120]   You don't have to.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.760]   If you just decide to say, yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.040]   I'm gonna have to think about that more
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.400]   and until I think about it, I'm not gonna eat it.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.600]   That's fine.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.520]   So, I'm not gonna convince you one way or the other,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.640]   but I believe the point of the passage is
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.360]   you do have a freedom because everything belongs to the Lord.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.600]   Eat it.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.920]   Okay?
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   Okay, let's move forward to the next section.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.120]   Verse 28 through verse 30.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.240]   Can I please have, let's see.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.520]   Diane Kim, can you please read verse 28 through verse 30?
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.980]   (audience member speaking)
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.560]   (audience member speaking)
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:32.400]   Okay.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.780]   All right, so verse 28 through 30,
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.020]   I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.300]   but there's a sense in which he flips back.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   Don't eat it.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.140]   Okay?
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.220]   He says, if, if it so happens
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.260]   that someone's conscience against a brother or sister,
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.780]   their conscience is bothered,
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.820]   and they tell you, hey, you can't eat that
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.860]   because that means sacrifice to idols.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.940]   He says, don't eat it for the sake of the conscience
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.260]   of the person who informed you.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.100]   Right?
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.260]   He says, don't eat it.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.180]   And then he makes sure, he says,
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.220]   I asked this question,
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.380]   so why is my freedom judged by another's conscience?
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.340]   And when I read that, I was a little confused.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.620]   I was like, if I asked that question,
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.020]   why is my freedom judged by another man's conscience?
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.080]   I almost would take that as like, so I can't eat it.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.660]   My conscience, you know, my freedom shouldn't be judged
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.860]   by another man's conscience.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.700]   Okay?
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:29.100]   Well, I wanna ask you this question.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.780]   What do you think the meaning of that is?
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.380]   What does it mean to have your freedom
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.440]   judged by another man's conscience?
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.260]   It's a bit confusing.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.780]   He's saying don't eat,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   and he uses the question to support his statement.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.360]   If someone brings it up to you, don't eat it.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.660]   What does it mean then to have your freedom
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.460]   judged by another man's conscience?
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:36:07.740]   - Cynthia, I can't say it.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.100]   - You don't wanna exercise your freedom
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.700]   in a way where someone whose conscience is bothered
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.860]   will have an opportunity to judge it
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.020]   and be bothered by your exercise of your own freedom.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.540]   - Right, okay.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.380]   So it's simply that.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.540]   I mean, it's not so much more
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.140]   than perhaps what you might have guessed.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.980]   I think what he's saying really is,
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.740]   in the exercise of your freedom,
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.820]   why exercise it in such a way
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.260]   where someone might accuse you of evil?
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.340]   So let me say that again.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.100]   Why exercise your freedom in a way
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.580]   where someone might accuse you of doing evil?
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.660]   Remember back in Romans chapter 14,
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.380]   verse 16 through 17,
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.620]   I'm just gonna read it for us for the sake of time.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.060]   He says, "Therefore, do not let what is for you
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.320]   "a good thing be spoken of as evil.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking,
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.720]   "but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.120]   And what's interesting is even the term for judge,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.980]   it's not kinda like judged as in judged against the Bible
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.660]   or all that kinda stuff.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.260]   That term literally just means
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.100]   to come to a conclusion about.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.060]   Okay, so someone's looking at you
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.460]   and they come to a conclusion like,
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.200]   huh, what that guy's doing is evil.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.500]   It's not really like a legal term.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.140]   The person who's looking at you
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.960]   just thinks of you as evil.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.660]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.000]   So here, Apostle Paul is calling us
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.980]   to a sense of wisdom, right?
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.480]   A sense of wisdom.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.960]   A sense of wisdom is in my actions,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.640]   is it going to lend for an opportunity
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.740]   for them to accuse me of evil?
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.620]   Or is it gonna lend to an opportunity for me
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.320]   to just, again, bolster their faith
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.440]   and the gospel message of salvation?
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.280]   Okay?
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   Are there any questions about that section?
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.340]   All right, then let's move on to the last section.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.400]   Verse 31 through chapter 11, verse one.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.040]   And if I can have, Mel Wong, can you read that for us?
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.080]   - Excuse me, whether then you need for thanks
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.560]   or whatever you do, you will also be glorified.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.040]   With no offense, I do you this,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.960]   with the teaching of Jesus.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.200]   Just as I also do you all, then,
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   it is also in the past.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.280]   Speaking my own prophet,
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.680]   let the prophet of the nations
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.480]   be the name you say to the imitators
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.560]   and the angels I have called.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.400]   - Okay.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.320]   This passage I bolded.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.520]   This is a passage we should actually
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.480]   try to devote to memory.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.560]   And this is a passage that all of us
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.760]   should try to keep rehearsing.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.440]   I'm not sure if you guys see value in repetition,
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.780]   but for me, I have a horrible memory,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.040]   and repetition is good.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.120]   It helps me learn.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.200]   And the thing about it is,
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.600]   he gives an overarching principle.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.640]   He said, "Don't eat, eat, don't eat."
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.280]   And I almost feel like, gosh, that's confusing.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.080]   Give me just one principle and let me do it, you know?
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.280]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.900]   he gives this now overarching consideration.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.680]   And the overarching consideration is,
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.960]   whether then you eat or drink,
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.400]   or whatever you do,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.120]   do all to the glory of God.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.480]   So he asked this question,
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.300]   would Jesus eat it, you know?
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:24.160]   Would God, you know, be pleased in your eating?
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.080]   You're not eating.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.560]   And so I left a blank there,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.480]   next to the question of,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.320]   what is the overarching principle?
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.240]   Now, obviously, the overarching principle is,
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.200]   whether you decide to eat or not eat,
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.040]   do it all to the glory of God, right?
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.160]   Do it all to the glory of God.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.280]   But to the blank next to that,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.740]   please write in there,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.760]   that is a life purpose statement.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.080]   Did I leave enough room for that?
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.100]   Life purpose statement.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.200]   Okay?
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.160]   Do you guys have life purpose statements?
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.080]   Do you guys have things that like,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.560]   you know, in the moment where you're like,
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.600]   I don't know what to do,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.400]   do you guys have a principle that will help you decide?
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.380]   Do you guys have something that's going to keep you in line
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.700]   with what should be the measure of success in your life?
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.440]   I think this one,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.680]   although it's probably the broadest one of all the Bible,
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.540]   is something that we should really rehearse and memorize.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.760]   This life purpose statement, right?
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.200]   That we need to do all things to the glory of God.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.760]   So, actually, it matters incredibly a lot
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.440]   why you do what you do.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.120]   It actually matters why you end up eating,
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.200]   and it matters even so why you end up not eating.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.120]   Right?
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.600]   So there isn't a blanket statement here,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.680]   in this scenario, do this, in this scenario, do that,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.500]   in this scenario, do this, and in this scenario, do that.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.920]   Although that can be very confusing,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.440]   there isn't a blanket statement for that.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's in that scenario,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.240]   what is going to be most glorifying to the Lord?
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.120]   Right?
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.040]   And I asked you a moment ago,
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.200]   or at the beginning of the study,
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.640]   when you think about what is most glorifying to God,
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.560]   what do you think about?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.040]   And I want you guys to share just a couple of those things.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.000]   Do I have any volunteers as to answer?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.640]   When you guys talked about what do you think
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.720]   is most glorifying to the Lord,
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.040]   what did you guys mention?
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:38.720]   - Evangelism.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.320]   - Evangelism, okay.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.200]   Anything else?
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.880]   Yes.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.520]   - Faith expressed through obedience,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.920]   prayer, dependence, and stuff like that.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.080]   (laughing)
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.520]   - And stuff like that, yeah.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.200]   Faith, obedience, dependence on God, prayer.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.240]   Okay, anything else?
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:13.880]   Yeah, I mean, with Apostle Paul,
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.560]   I love the fact that we get a glimpse
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.800]   into his mind frame, how he thinks, you know?
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.000]   And he's just so goal-driven,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   and he's so, like, in many ways, purpose-driven, you know?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.520]   And his purpose is so set on glorifying God,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.280]   but he has quite a clear vision
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.640]   as to what is most glorifying to God.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.040]   And if you remember back in chapter nine, right?
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.120]   Let me see here.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.840]   Oops, I'm in Romans, that's why I'm like, what is this?
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.580]   Remember back in chapter nine, verse 22 to 23?
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.480]   Back in chapter nine, verse 22 to 23.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.080]   To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.840]   I have become all things to all men,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:00.120]   so that I may by all means save some.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.080]   I do all things for the sake of the gospel,
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.040]   so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.040]   He sees as so precious, so valuable,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.080]   the salvation of souls,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.700]   that he would dare not put any stumbling block, right?
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.160]   To see an individual go from the kingdom of darkness
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.080]   to the kingdom of light,
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.440]   to see an individual go from orphan child
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.540]   to daughter and son of God,
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.520]   to see an individual as those who are slaves of their sins,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.280]   to slaves of righteousness,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.640]   to see an individual who had no God in the world
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.880]   to go to now giving thanks with their mouths
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.360]   to the Lord of heaven,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.560]   he sees nothing else that would be a greater honor to God.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.720]   Right?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.480]   And so Apostle Paul has as his great ambition
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.680]   to make sure that they might be saved.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.120]   So he ends it right at the end,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.560]   where in verse 33,
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.520]   just as I also please all men in all things,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.200]   not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many,
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.240]   so that they may be saved.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.680]   Genuinely saved.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.320]   And again, just love that kind of passionate,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.820]   bold, focused, intentional,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.800]   very driven life that desires to seek
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.280]   the salvation of the lost.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.760]   I want us to think about that a little bit is,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.240]   for us, when we think about the glory of God,
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.320]   giving him honor, giving him praise,
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.720]   what are we thinking?
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.640]   And all the things that you guys mentioned, it's right.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.980]   We give glory when we reflect God's nature,
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.720]   we give glory when we show him to be a sufficient provider,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.600]   we give him glory when we show his answer of prayer,
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.080]   we give him glory when we ourselves are thankful
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.240]   for his gospel, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.080]   But in this passage, at least,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.120]   he's really thinking about the glory of God
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.040]   when it comes down to those who'd be saved by the gospel.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.880]   Right?
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.000]   Those who'd be saved by the gospel.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.040]   Now by way of concluding and wrapping up,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   I really think that this passage, in my mind,
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.260]   is a question of those who not only discern
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.500]   between right and wrong,
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.320]   but those who discern what is best.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.240]   What is most mature.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.160]   You know, the benefit of having a veteran on your team,
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.400]   let's say you're playing football, and you have a veteran,
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.940]   a lot of the game of football,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.920]   you have to react instantaneously.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.360]   If you guys ever played defense on football,
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   if you guys played anything, you have to just react.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.960]   You're looking at the quarterback's eyes,
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.640]   you're looking at formation, and you just have to react.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.920]   The great thing about having a veteran
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.660]   is that through experience, they know what to do.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.660]   I mean, a coach can sit there telling a rookie,
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.580]   okay, if the quarterback throws deep, you do this.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.180]   If the quarterback starts to pass off, you do this.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.820]   But given all those different conditions,
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.380]   the rookie would sit there and be like,
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.660]   is it now, like, for right now, do I do this?
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.420]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.060]   And so in my mind, when I think about Apostle Paul,
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:08.900]   he's a veteran.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.040]   And he's looking at the scenario,
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.620]   and then trying to teach the Church of Corinth,
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.660]   like, when you see the faith of the other people,
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.960]   you ought to be thinking like this.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.620]   When you see what idolatry is, and what it represents,
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.620]   you ought to be thinking like this.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.740]   When it comes to your own conscience,
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.660]   you should be thinking like this.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.060]   So he's giving, yes, all these conditional statements,
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.820]   but he gives them the overarching priority, right?
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.120]   The overarching priority is that you glorify God
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.060]   and honor Him in this.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.380]   And we, if we are to mature,
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.060]   we need to do that with practice.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.780]   So you guys ask good questions.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.220]   In this scenario, what's most honoring to God?
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.220]   In this scenario, what's really going to magnify the Gospel?
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:54.060]   In this scenario, what's really going to glorify our Maker?
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.300]   Okay?
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.580]   All right.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.980]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:03.020]   Father God, we wanna thank you.
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:08.580]   Lord, we get a glimpse into the kind of focus
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.860]   that Apostle Paul has.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.860]   And in many ways, he's trying to impart his focus
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.940]   upon the church, and calling them to follow him
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.380]   as he's laid a pattern of willing self-sacrifice
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.860]   and self-restraint for the benefit of the rest.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.980]   And I pray, Father God, that we as a church
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.740]   would continue to mature.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.620]   God, help us never to be a people who simply insist
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:36.020]   on our own rights, our own benefits, and our own securities.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.260]   But rather, God, help us to really follow the footsteps
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.580]   of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who condescended,
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.620]   who sacrificed, and who really gave up much
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.300]   so that those who would come to salvation would benefit,
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.780]   and that he would lead many brothers into God's glory.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.020]   I pray, Lord, that you would give us
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.060]   that same kind of vision, the same kind of purpose
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.020]   and motivation in our lives.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.700]   Father Lord, we do pray for every single person here.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:04.700]   God, many of us live lives that are very busy.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.740]   God, we have work that consumes a lot of our energy,
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.620]   our time, and our focus.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.020]   Help us, Father God, to persevere past that,
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:18.020]   to persevere past fatigue, to persevere past distraction,
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.780]   and sometimes feeling unmotivated
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.620]   because our energy is sapped.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.460]   I pray, rather, God, that you would encourage us
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.260]   all the more with the energy that we have.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.660]   Help us to honor you.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.660]   Whatever we can afford, help us to glorify you.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.920]   And if you would see fit, and by your grace,
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.340]   give us the mercy of being used as your tool
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.180]   to share the gospel, and have the pure joy
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.900]   of seeing somebody, have the joy of Christ by being saved.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.620]   I pray, Father God, that by all means would you use us.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.860]   Lord, we wanna thank you again in Saint Christ's name.
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.140]   Amen.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:51.980]   Okay.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.540]   If you guys would jot down, I realized,
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.300]   and I didn't have the discussion questions
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.700]   written on your thing, but I wrote it in my teaching notes.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.880]   I've just basically asked the question,
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.840]   what are some real life scenarios
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.480]   where we can decline our liberty?
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.880]   So just what are some real life scenarios
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.340]   that we can decline our own liberties?
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:19.240]   Second, I just mentioned it, but practically,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.140]   how can we give more glory to God,
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.160]   and keep that as our purpose in life?
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.040]   How can we give more glory to God,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.300]   and keep that as a purpose for our lives?
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.960]   But also, what tangible ways can we
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.240]   actively seek the benefit of others?
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.840]   What tangible ways can we actively
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.440]   seek the benefit of others?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.500]   Okay.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.840]   So those are just some questions.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.640]   If you guys have any other points of conviction,
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.240]   or applications you guys wanna share, you guys can do that.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.400]   So hope you guys have a good time of discussion, okay?
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.760]   All right, thanks everyone.
