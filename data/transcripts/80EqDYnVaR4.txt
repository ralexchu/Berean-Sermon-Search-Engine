[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   The reason why we watch this video is because Pastor Lee from,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   not Dropbox, Baby Box, is actually going to be with us in a couple of weeks.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And so on two Sundays, on September 18th, he was going to be joining us.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   And we're going to be having a special session where he's going to be giving his testimony.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And we have an opportunity to interact with him, ask him questions about his ministry,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   how it began and all that stuff.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And so we're going to have it at 1.30.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   So after the service, you'll be able to go grab lunch and come back to the cafe area.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And we're hoping that we can do it over there.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   If we have too many people, we may have to come back into this room.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   But he is coming in two weeks, not next Sunday, but the Sunday after.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And so we're going to be giving announcements.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But for that next Sunday, we are planning to take special offering for his ministry.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And so it will remind you through emails and through posts that we're going to be collecting for next Sunday.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And then we'll be able to give it to him when he comes.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   So he's coming to join the Lee family.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   The Lee family is going to be taking care of him all day that day.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But, again, he graciously offered to be while he's here with us to present that for us.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   So, again, just keep that in mind.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And, again, we'll remind you of the offering that we're taking next week.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Okay.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Just a few announcements before we get started.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   First of all, our membership class, our new round of membership class is starting on October 2nd.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So today was the last day of membership class for this session.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   They're going to take a short break.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And then a new round is starting on October 2nd.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   So Pastor Nate is in charge of that.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So if you're interested, please let him know or refer them to Pastor Nate,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   and he'll tell you what's going on with that and when to come.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Trunk Formation.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   This is, again, for the Halloween festivals.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We're trying to get our children to be at church, and they can learn about the Reformation.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And so they are in need of volunteers.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And so if you can come and help out with that so that the children and the families can come
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and experience that day together, so please let Esther Leong.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Okay.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   So, again, if you don't know who she is, we'll put that information on the website and also on our app.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And so you can contact them and let them know that you'll be able to come and help out.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   One last announcement.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   The others we'll get to when we get closer to the date.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   This is the first and only time I'm going to make this announcement.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   There's BBA is starting up again.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Okay.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And for the regular, look for Johnny Wang and John Yang.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I think they have a table outside, so I don't know if they're going to do it today because they don't want to melt.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   But they did have it last week, so if you haven't signed up, please sign up as soon as possible
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   because they're going to be putting people on the teams.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   There is a WBBA, Women's BBA, and let's see, David Jung's name, Ashley Hamamoto, is in charge of that,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   so please contact her.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And then there is a Legends basketball.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So those of you who want, rather play half court.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   You're just as skilled, but you'd rather play half court.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Okay.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And see Elder Phillip, and he'll direct you to the things that you'll need to participate in that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Okay.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   All right.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   So let me pray for us, and we'll give an opportunity to give you an offering.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Again, if it's possible to use Zelle, because we're having issues with the other avenues of electronic funding
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   that's coming in.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   If you did bring a physical check, again, we have a box on the way out that says "offering,"
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   and it's under that big clock.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You can drop it off there as you're leaving.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   After the offering, we're going to have our Sister Kaylee come,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   and she's going to give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   All right.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Let's pray.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come and worship you together
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   with all the distractions and all the things that are going on in our lives.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   We thank you, Father God, for calling us week after week to fellowship, to share, to sing, to hear your word.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I pray that your Holy Spirit would minister this morning.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   May your word and the fellowship of your spirit, our singing, all of it, Lord God, may be anointed by your grace.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And especially now as we give this offering, may you, that even in our giving, Lord God,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   that you would correct our hearts, guide us, focus us, that we may offer it to you in a way that honors you
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   and may it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Amen.

[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.120]   (audience murmuring)
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.040]   - Hi, my name is Kaylee Fong,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.560]   and this is one of many stories
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.040]   of how God saved a broken, wretched, depraved sinner.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.560]   By God's grace, I was born into a Christian household
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.800]   with parents who loved the Lord
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.480]   and sought to raise me and my siblings
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.440]   under the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.280]   When I was around five years old,
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.520]   I remember praying the prayer with my parents,
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.740]   asking Jesus to come into my life,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.680]   but not truly having a heart of repentance,
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.580]   nor a true understanding of what it actually meant
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.720]   to accept Christ into my life as Lord and Savior.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.920]   Because of this quote-unquote salvation that I had,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.800]   I viewed myself as a Christian,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.860]   whether it was doing my best to be a morally good person
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.000]   or going to church every Sunday.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.600]   However, while I didn't question God
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.360]   nor the validity of the word,
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   I lacked a renewed heart, mind,
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.780]   and ultimately a personal relationship with God.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.720]   My hardened heart recognized the gospel
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.280]   as something meant for new believers or converts,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.440]   thinking I could be saved
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.880]   while continuing to live any way I wanted
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.680]   and not understanding how the gospel
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.000]   is at the very center of true faith.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.400]   I was still dead in my sins,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.460]   blind to the very things that separated me from God
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.020]   and lacking the righteous fear of God.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.160]   To sum it all up, my attachment to the world
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.900]   was apparent with the pursuits of my heart.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.240]   By God's grace and love,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.800]   he disciplined me in my sophomore year of high school
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.920]   through my relationships
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.100]   with some of my friends at the time.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.800]   During this period of my life, God revealed my sins to me,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.200]   especially during the beginning of these problems.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.500]   I sought comfort in my non-Christian peers,
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.060]   seeking those who would agree
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.720]   with the justification of my own sinfulness,
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   playing victim when I was the perpetrator,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.600]   not only against my friends that I hurt, but against God.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.940]   These actions led me down a bad path
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.880]   with gossip fueling the flame.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.240]   Looking back, I think that this was the first time
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.080]   I hated myself and my sins
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.480]   and had a desire to turn from them.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.640]   My life at this time was filled with the desire
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.200]   to satisfy my own flesh,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.440]   to be accepted and liked by my peers,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.660]   and even clear my name
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   at the extent of tainting the reputations of others.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:33.880]   I will forever be thankful to God for this child
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.080]   and his faithfulness throughout it,
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.020]   providing me with a loving family who prayed for me,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.640]   encouraged me, and pointed me to scripture,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.520]   even rebuking me in my wrongdoings.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.400]   As the problems came to a close,
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.760]   while relationships were lost,
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.480]   God continued to lead me closer to him.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.600]   Later that year, when my older sister, Sarah,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.200]   came back home for the summer
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.880]   after her first year of college,
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.200]   I saw the change in her heart
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.640]   and her desire to follow Christ's example.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.520]   She led Bible study sessions with me and my younger sister,
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.800]   challenging us to dive deeper into the word
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.320]   and to truly apply God's word into our own lives.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.360]   In these moments, God softened and renewed my heart,
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.000]   and I truly desired to know God
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.280]   in the way that my sister knew him.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.760]   I can say with confidence that I was truly saved
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.240]   and regenerated with a new life in the Holy Spirit
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.520]   around this time of my life.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.200]   I was also, during the summer,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.480]   or it was also during the summer
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   that I began to be in the word daily up to this day.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.440]   With this, I know that it was only truly God
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.160]   who gave me this desire and hunger for the word,
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.520]   and that it is only by Christ's death and resurrection
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.240]   on the cross for my sins
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.360]   that I am able to have this relationship with God.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.420]   God has given me so precious a salvation and new life,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.120]   allowing me to see and experience true peace, joy, love,
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.600]   along with many other blessings.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.960]   After being saved for these past few years,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.840]   God has continually reminded me to surrender myself to him
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.640]   and to live my life according to his will instead of my own.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.400]   Despite COVID times being difficult,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.840]   God has provided so much fruit in my life.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.760]   Through the time I was being discipled
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.280]   by an older sister in Christ,
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.960]   my transition into college,
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.040]   and my search for a church
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.760]   where I can grow alongside other believers,
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.920]   God has provided me with a greater boldness,
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.000]   courage, and openness than I have ever experienced,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.780]   showing me that I should not be afraid
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.320]   to share the precious gift of faith
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.960]   that I have been given with others,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.240]   and has taught me to let go of the struggles I face
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.800]   by lifting them up to him who is able to conquer all things.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.560]   It still amazes me to this day
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.300]   why God chose to save me, or why he loves me,
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.440]   a sinner who has fallen so short of his glory.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   One passage that I really love is Romans 38 to 39.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.840]   It says, "For I'm sure that neither death nor life,
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.460]   "nor angels nor rulers, nor things present,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.340]   "nor things to come, nor powers, nor height,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.540]   "nor depth, nor anything else in all creation
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.800]   "will be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.720]   "in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.520]   While I cannot fathom the true depths of our creator's love,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.140]   I can know with full assurance
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.180]   that no matter what may come in this life on earth,
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.860]   I can place my hope fully on the living hope, Jesus Christ,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.740]   who I have died with to sin and have risen with in new life.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.520]   All I can say is thank you, Jesus, for saving me.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.360]   Thank you.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.100]   (gentle music)
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.680]   (gentle music)
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.260]   (gentle music)
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.840]   (gentle music)
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.420]   (gentle music)
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:38:10.300]  , (audience applauding)
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.380]   - All right, congratulations, Kaylee,
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.760]   and thank you for that great testimony.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.960]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter three,
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.160]   I'm gonna be reading starting from verse three
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.060]   down to verse nine, but we're gonna be dealing
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.160]   with the whole section all the way up to verse 14 today.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.740]   Luke chapter three, verses three to nine.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.580]   And he came into the district around the Jordan
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.120]   preaching a baptism of repentance
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.960]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.320]   And it is written in the book of the words
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.120]   of Isaiah the prophet, the voice of one crying
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.860]   in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Lord.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.040]   Make his path straight, every ravine will be filled
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.620]   and every mountain and hill will be brought low.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.200]   The crooked will become straight
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   and the rough roads smooth
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.800]   and all flesh will see the salvation of God.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.960]   So he began saying to the crowds who were going out
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.360]   to be baptized by him, you brood of vipers,
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.840]   who warned you to flee from the wrath to come.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.000]   Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.080]   and do not begin to say to yourselves,
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.640]   we have Abraham for our father.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.520]   For I say to you that from these stones,
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.320]   God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.800]   Indeed, the ax is already laid at the root of the tree.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.200]   So every tree that does not bear good fruit
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.960]   is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.800]   Let's pray.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:33.880]   Heavenly father, we pray for your Holy Spirit's power
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.680]   to move us, guide us, open our ears
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.500]   that we may hear from you.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.480]   Soften our hearts that we may be easily molded
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.280]   to be what you desire us to be.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.680]   You are the potter, we are the clay
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.480]   and we are ready to hear your word.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.600]   You know, I didn't mention the two things,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.560]   again, I forgot to mention is next Sunday,
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.120]   the cry room is going to be moved to the other side, okay?
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.240]   We're trying to prepare for the students coming
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.220]   and so we're gonna get all that ready by this week.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.700]   And so starting from next Sunday,
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.780]   we're gonna have the cry room.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.460]   So we're setting up the different places,
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.300]   it'll be a little bit easier to,
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.500]   if you have children you need to watch,
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.900]   it's gonna be a big screen set up.
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.620]   So just kind of be ready for that
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.220]   and then we're gonna be opening up that area,
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.980]   at least the windows are gonna be gone
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.380]   and we're gonna take extra seats to be seated over there.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.340]   So that's starting next week.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.980]   The other thing is, we're picking up
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.620]   India Mission trip again this winter
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.400]   and so the dates are January 20th through 28th.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.560]   We only have a few more spots left
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.000]   and so this is gonna be a short trip
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.520]   where we leave on the 20th and come back on the 28th.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.600]   If you are an eye doctor, we need you more than ever
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.100]   so you'll get first priority
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.560]   because that's the main work that we're doing.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.360]   You don't have to be an eye doctor,
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.980]   it is a medical mission trip
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.040]   but we need more assistance than doctors normally
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.320]   but it just happens that this year
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.200]   we need some more eye doctors to go.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.280]   So if you're able to go, please let me know
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.320]   and because there's only a small space,
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.800]   I actually need to know today.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.640]   (laughing)
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.800]   So during service, just raise your hand and I'll know.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.520]   Yeah, so actually Cross Life has always joined us in this
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.720]   and so they're gonna tell me a few people
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   that they're able to go.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.360]   So we're gonna have to lock up the spots today
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.400]   so if God is speaking to you now, right?
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.760]   (laughing)
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.640]   As soon as possible, if this is on your heart
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.740]   and again, especially if you're an eye doctor,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.640]   please let us know.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.880]   Okay, well along with that,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.400]   you know years ago when we first started going out to India,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.480]   we were actually warned not to go
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.600]   and the reason why is because this place
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.280]   that we were going was so deep in the boonies
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.240]   that even the missionaries who were stationed
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.640]   out in the big city in Bangalore
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.560]   were telling us that they don't venture out
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.880]   beyond two hours because after two hours,
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.520]   the area's not developed.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.760]   There's Hindu nationalists who basically has free reign
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.800]   and they're telling us that this road
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.720]   is gonna take us five hours into the boonies
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.240]   and so if something happens,
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.300]   it's gonna be very difficult to get us out
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.640]   'cause there's nobody there to help us.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.800]   So you know, prayed about it
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.620]   and we thought this work is important enough
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.720]   and so I remember the first year we did go,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.300]   you know we had the pastors, not just here,
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.240]   but outside the church praying for us
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.360]   and those of you, there's some of you who are here
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.160]   that went that first year in particular,
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.880]   we kinda had to tell people to make sure
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.560]   you get everything in order.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.360]   You know, if something happens, make sure that,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.960]   you know, that people are able to be prepared
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.480]   and I remember before I left, I had to leave like,
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.000]   you know, make sure Esther knew
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.320]   where all the bank accounts were,
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.160]   there's nothing hidden and then,
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.640]   so you know, I didn't wanna scare her
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.180]   but at the same time, where we were going
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.980]   was not a safe place to go.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.560]   And so when we got there, we got onto a car
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.400]   and there was about an hour worth of road that was paved
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.880]   and after that, it was like basically one road,
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.480]   dirt road, another four hours into deep part
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.500]   of where we were going and all of us,
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.000]   even though we were laughing and having fun,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.660]   we were a bit nervous.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.040]   You know, we're nervous 'cause we don't know
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.640]   if something does happen here, you know,
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.700]   man, this is a long way to go on this dirt road
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.160]   to come back and so, you know,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.120]   that's kind of how it started
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.360]   and so obviously, each year, we got more accustomed
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.740]   and so one of the things that I've noticed
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.840]   through the years, especially in the last,
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.480]   maybe about three to four years,
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.720]   that there was a big sign, I think starting
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.480]   from the second year, that Hyundai was coming.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.000]   So, you know, before all the factories were out
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.240]   in China and Vietnam and so a lot of them
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.600]   are starting to come into India
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.200]   and Hyundai bought a huge, you know,
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.720]   part of land over there and so every year we went,
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.200]   we saw a little bit more, a little bit more being developed
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.240]   and now, when we take that road,
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.120]   it's become actually one of the best highways,
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.040]   better than here, it's like four lane highways
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.800]   on both sides and because it's headed out to nowhere,
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.480]   other than to Hyundai, that it usually
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.560]   doesn't have much traffic.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.520]   So you have, what used to take us about five and a half
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.120]   hours to get to where we go, now it's about three and a half
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.720]   and it saved us maybe about an hour,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.520]   hour and a half of driving and right up to Hyundai,
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.840]   you know, right, all of a sudden,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.120]   in the middle of nowhere, you'll see Korean barbecue,
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.440]   you know, Korean spa, Korean,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.520]   you see Korean signs everywhere in the middle of India,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.960]   you know, and then all the roads right up to that
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   and then right as you pass Hyundai,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.160]   it gets back to the old roads, you know.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.360]   Obviously, we knew something important was coming
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.400]   because of these roads, right,
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.880]   as Hyundai has invested so much money right there
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.720]   and then they said over 30,000 people who have come
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.120]   just to work in that area and obviously,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.360]   they're, you know, wealthy people, executives
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.760]   and so they had to build all this infrastructure
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.320]   just to get this company to come in.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.400]   Obviously, you know where I'm going with this, right?
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.840]   This road was invested because without these roads,
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.800]   we can't get there.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.160]   The text says in Luke 3, 4 to 6,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.320]   that was the whole purpose of John the Baptist.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.040]   Before Christ can come,
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.360]   John the Baptist was sent ahead of him
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.040]   to prepare the best roads to get to the Messiah
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.760]   and the way it was explained, he says,
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.480]   every ravine will be filled and every mountain
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.640]   and hill will be brought low,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.560]   the crooked will become straight and the rough road smooth
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.320]   and all flesh will see the salvation of God.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.120]   So he was to basically prepare the road
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.520]   for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.680]   But when we think of John the Baptist's ministry, right,
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.440]   when he comes on the scene,
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.520]   he doesn't come with the shovel, right?
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.840]   The caterpillar, you know, wasn't there at that time.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.080]   So what did he do?
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.440]   He doesn't hold any office.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.960]   In fact, there's no record of John the Baptist
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.340]   performing any miracles.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.800]   So this that he's been called to do,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.280]   to do, you know, basically lower the mountains
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.680]   and fill the ravines, all of this was by one thing.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.640]   All we know about John the Baptist, that he was a preacher.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.920]   The way he was going to prepare for the coming of Christ,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.960]   the way he was going to prepare the road
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.600]   that's going to lead to Christ was through his preaching.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.160]   And so we need to recognize what his preaching was.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.840]   If his preaching and his message
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.720]   was primarily to get us to God,
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.100]   what was the content of his preaching?
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.640]   His preaching is described for us in that prophecy of Isaiah
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.240]   as voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.500]   crying in the wilderness.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.520]   You know, the funny story about when we were
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.000]   doing construction in this building,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.700]   we had contractors here, you know, putting windows
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.760]   and fortifying that room over there.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.720]   And it used to be a racquetball court in that room,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   where everybody's in right now.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.400]   And they would ask him, "What is this room for?
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.520]   "Why are you putting windows here?"
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.700]   And I told them that it's a cry room.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   And you could see the confusion on their faces.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.040]   Like, "Oh, cry room, cry room."
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.400]   And they didn't ask me right away,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.040]   but eventually they were curious,
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.740]   and it's like, "Cry room?
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.160]   "You have a separate room for people to cry?"
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.640]   And it never dawned on me that that's how they would hear it
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.200]   because they're not Christians.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.280]   And so initially I was like, "You know, for the babies."
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.480]   Right, and then it's like, "Huh."
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.600]   And so now I have to explain to them.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.000]   It's like, you know, young parents who have young children,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.680]   and if they cry, so we call it the cry room,
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.640]   it's really for parents with young children.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.160]   It's like, "Oh, that's what that means."
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.560]   When he says, "Crying in the wilderness,"
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.480]   it's not just referring to,
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.960]   "John the Baptist went to the wilderness
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.440]   "and just cried all day."
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.620]   Crying meaning, like he was proclaiming with passion,
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.760]   crying, like crying out loud,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.640]   that his preaching was not just nonchalant.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.480]   And, you know, when I think of John the Baptist
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.920]   being described as preaching, crying out,
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.440]   I think of Jonah, you know, the prophet,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.400]   maybe exactly the opposite, you know,
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.580]   a reluctant prophet who literally had to have his arms
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.520]   twisted to go into Nineveh
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.320]   and preach a message of repentance,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.560]   knowing that if they repented, that God would forgive them,
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.940]   and he didn't want God to forgive them.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.000]   So when he went to Nineveh,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.080]   I would imagine that Jonah was not crying,
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.200]   exactly the opposite.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.600]   Maybe he whispered, you know, as he was walking along,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.440]   and he's like, "Have you ever repented?
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.440]   "How may I forgive you?"
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.320]   Right, he's like, "I did my job!"
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.360]   Somebody who is saying something
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.000]   that they really don't care,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.920]   they're just gonna do the absolute minimum.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.920]   I can see Jonah is the exact opposite of John the Baptist,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.440]   and despite the fact, this weak preacher,
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.760]   revival broke out in Nineveh.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.680]   Well, John the Baptist was sent,
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.440]   and he was crying out, and he was pleading
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.760]   with the nation of Israel to prepare for his coming.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.200]   But his primary message,
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.240]   in fact, we don't have many things that we know
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.000]   about what John the Baptist said.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.080]   His primary message is recorded in verse three.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.420]   It says, "He preached a baptism of repentance
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.400]   "for the forgiveness of sins."
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.720]   In a nutshell, that was his whole message,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.660]   baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.500]   Now, preaching repentance is not new to John the Baptist.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.320]   If you study any part of the Old Testament prophets,
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.760]   their primary message was the same thing.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.320]   If you do not repent, judgment is coming.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.680]   That's their primary message.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.200]   Almost every prophet had the same message,
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.160]   that because you've rebelled against God,
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.400]   yet you do not obey his commandment, judgment is coming.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.120]   But what makes John the Baptist's preaching unique?
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.000]   Is that they called it the baptism of repentance.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.320]   Again, in order to understand exactly what's going on,
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.800]   why baptism of repentance is described to his message,
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.340]   is baptism, the ceremony in and of itself,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:59.340]   was not created new from John the Baptist.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.940]   In fact, that ceremony of being dunked into the water
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.640]   and come out, in fact, the word baptizo
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.000]   basically means to dunk, right?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.120]   That ceremony was kind of similar to what we do today
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.320]   in our society, like an invocation or dedication.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.820]   Many of you who are in the medical field,
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.860]   after you graduate and before you become,
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.080]   you know, like sent out to do your work,
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.000]   you have a white coat ceremony
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.040]   where they put that coat on you
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.120]   and that's to kind of separate you from your civilian life
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.200]   so that you can serve the people.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   And so it's an act of dedication,
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   that now you're getting special permission to do this work.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.440]   Well, baptism ceremony itself at that time
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.320]   in the secular world was used kind of like an invocation.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.760]   And in particular, when somebody decided to serve
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.600]   as a servant in politics in Athens,
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.480]   they would have the ceremony signifying
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.680]   that they're putting down their civilian life
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.400]   and they're taking on this public life to serve.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.720]   So they're no longer civilians,
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.780]   but they are being ordained specifically
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.720]   to serve their people.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.560]   Now, that's what baptism was for.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.280]   And the reason why they taught this
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.040]   is to signify exactly what it signifies to us,
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.360]   that your old life is dead
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.520]   and that now you're gonna begin to live a new life.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.440]   So just by saying baptism,
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.360]   people would have understood that that's what it is,
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.280]   is a special dedication.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.320]   But John's baptism is not just described as baptist,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.880]   but the baptism of what?
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.000]   Repentance.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.120]   It wasn't just an invocation, it wasn't just a dedication,
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.960]   but baptism, the word in and of itself,
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.760]   metanoia, means to change your mind.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.820]   So meaning, it wasn't just an external,
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.680]   where you are living externally one way
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.600]   and then now you've taken upon yourself a new job.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.580]   It required repentance, a complete transformation,
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.440]   and putting away internally and externally
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.280]   your old life and receiving a new life.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:03.660]   In fact, John became so prominent in his generation,
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.960]   Josephus, a Jewish historian who was not a Christian,
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.520]   who recorded much of what was going on
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.820]   in Christianity at that time,
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.680]   Josephus in his writing actually mentions John the Baptist
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   and he says this,
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.420]   John's baptism required a cleansed soul.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.800]   You know, all the other baptism,
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.960]   it was just, they were just kind of going from dedication
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.120]   from one way of life to a new way of life externally,
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.880]   but it says John's baptism required a cleansed soul.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.040]   Even Josephus, a non-Christian historian
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.160]   watching what was going on,
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:40.160]   understood what it meant to proclaim baptism of repentance.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.320]   I think one of the best illustrations
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.920]   that I see in the New Testament of true repentance
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.600]   is Apostle Paul, you know, where he, before he met Christ,
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.400]   you know, he was willing to murder in the name of God,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.740]   thinking that he's doing God a favor,
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.000]   but then he meets Jesus and the road to Damascus
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.320]   and he completely is thrown off.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.120]   Everything that he knew was wrong
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.240]   and he becomes blind for three days.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   Can you imagine for three days what was going on in his mind?
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.600]   He's probably sifting through the law
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.040]   and that everything he understood about the law may be wrong.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.360]   Everything he understood about the Messiah was wrong.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.760]   In fact, everything he did,
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.180]   he committed murder in the name of God was wrong.
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:26.580]   So after three days, his eyes become open.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.320]   Can you imagine what that must've been like?
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.160]   That he no longer saw anything the same way.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.140]   He didn't just see like, oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.520]   Oh, maybe I should have been more vigorous in doing this.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.680]   So everything after he met Christ was completely different.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.520]   In fact, he was so different
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.720]   that even the apostles had a hard time believing.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.580]   How can this be the same man?
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.320]   How can be this the same guy who took responsibility
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.940]   for the first martyr in the church?
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.280]   How can be this guy be the same guy
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.040]   who took soldiers to go and get Christians?
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.520]   And it took a while to warm up to his conversion
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.820]   because he was so radical.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.160]   See, the idea of repentance,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.040]   baptism of repentance is double fold
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.640]   because baptism in and of itself means conversion,
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.160]   but repentance is exponentially above that.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.200]   Not only externally, but internally.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.880]   In every way, he's a completely new creation.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.660]   And that was the preaching of John the Baptist.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.240]   He was so effective in his preaching
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.480]   that even leaders traveled far distances,
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.880]   Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes,
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.560]   and just regular people started to come out
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.000]   to where he was,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.280]   to some strange place in the wilderness
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.580]   because of his preaching.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.120]   They knew something was different about him.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.360]   Remember we talked about last week,
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.320]   it says the word of the Lord came to him,
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:55.200]   and that was very specific about an anointed prophet
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.680]   who was going to come and speak for God.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.880]   So it wasn't that they didn't have the word of God.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.760]   At this time, the Septuagint,
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.080]   the Old Testament was translated into Greek,
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.200]   and they had more access to the Bible,
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.960]   the Old Testament, than they ever had in history.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.000]   I would say it would be, at least up to that point,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.720]   it would be very similar to today for us.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.760]   We have more access to the written word
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.600]   and the preaching of the written word
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.420]   than we have ever, any Christian has ever had in history.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.380]   Ever, especially me and you.
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:33.000]   Our problem is what translation we should use,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.320]   what Bible program, what pastor do we like?
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.640]   We can wake up three in the morning
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.160]   and hear the best preachers of our generation
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.480]   just click of a button in our car, in our ear.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.560]   We can download all of that.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.680]   We have access to the written word of God
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.120]   more than anybody has ever.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.880]   See, the period that the first generation Jews had
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.000]   was very similar to that
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.440]   'cause there was a period
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.120]   when they didn't have access to the scrolls.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.440]   But during that period where they allowed,
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.560]   the Romans allowed them to practice their faith,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.440]   that they did have access.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.260]   But the problem was when Amos said
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.600]   that part of the judgment,
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.660]   and one of the last judgment
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.380]   that's gonna come upon the nation of Israel
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.160]   is that there's going to be the famine of the word,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.020]   that they're gonna be staggering from place to place
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.020]   to hear the word of God, but they're not gonna find it.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.140]   And he wasn't simply talking
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.940]   that they're gonna lose the scroll
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.500]   or they're not gonna know what the Old Testament says.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.460]   They had full access to that.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.980]   But they didn't have a man of God
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.600]   speaking directly to them.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.440]   Again, it's much like today
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.580]   where we have the word of God, access to the word of God,
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:46.260]   but we are more ignorant to what the word of God says
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.120]   than probably ever in history.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:51.420]   When John the Bapst began to speak,
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.700]   people began to recognize,
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.260]   this guy is not like the other scribes.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.020]   He's not just regurgitating information.
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:56:59.940]   He's not just talking.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.060]   He's not just a learned man.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.740]   They could tell that he was a prophet sent from God.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.140]   And so people out of curiosity begin to come,
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.220]   and some very prominent people.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.940]   It doesn't mention here,
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:14.540]   but in the other gospels, it mentions that Pharisees,
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.900]   people with authority, leaders of Israel,
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.580]   were coming to this guy, Ethan the Widener, strange guy.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.700]   His diet is weird, his dress is weird.
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:25.600]   And then his preaching is different.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:29.260]   So you would think that when John saw these people
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.660]   who were coming and the crowds were growing,
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.460]   that being aware of who's in this crowd,
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:37.500]   that John the Baptist may have addressed them saying,
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.900]   "My distinguished guests,
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.100]   "thank you for traveling long distances
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.300]   "to come here to hear a humble man."
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.740]   You would think that that's what he would say.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.120]   Instead, what does he say?
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.320]   "You brood of vipers.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.300]   "Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:58.860]   Basically, he said, "You snakes!"
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.180]   That's what came out of his mouth.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.700]   These distinguished people were coming to listen to him.
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.740]   "You snakes!"
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.020]   In fact, that's probably one of the worst things
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.900]   that you could have called a Jew at that time.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.980]   Snake is a filthy animal.
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:14.740]   But not only is it filthy, historically,
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:20.780]   snakes is how Satan was presented at the Garden of Eden.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.260]   So to call somebody a viper,
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.700]   and again, not only is he a snake,
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:29.380]   but a viper is venomous and is dangerous to other people.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.020]   He doesn't say it here, but later on,
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.660]   Jesus will call them out and say,
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.280]   "Because of their sins and their hypocrisy,
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.780]   "they're ruining all of Israel."
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.340]   And he says, "Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees."
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.040]   Leaven is basically another word of saying the poison.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.140]   He goes even deeper than that.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.460]   He doesn't just call them viper.
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:50.940]   He says, "You brood of vipers.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:53.580]   "Not only are you a snake, your mom's a snake.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.660]   "Your dad's a snake.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.860]   "Your grandfather's a snake.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.260]   "Your ancestors are snakes.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.180]   "You come from a line of snakes."
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:05.100]   So this is the worst, most offensive thing
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.020]   that you could probably say to a Jew.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.140]   You think about today, what's the worst thing
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.420]   that you could say to somebody?
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.900]   Don't say it, right?
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:12.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.800]   Don't even think it too loud, right?
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.260]   Maybe racist.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:19.100]   Right?
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.620]   I mean, there's a lot of things that we could think of,
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.140]   and in our generation, you can get away with a lot of things
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.100]   but you call somebody a racist,
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.600]   that's almost like the worst thing you can say, right?
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.780]   Well, he goes straight to the matter.
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.660]   He doesn't mix words.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.660]   He doesn't build up to that.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.740]   He sees their sins.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.500]   You brood of vipers.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:41.120]   Jesus himself uses this term repeatedly to the Jews.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.420]   Matthew 23, 33, "You serpents, you brood of vipers.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.360]   "How will you escape the sentence of hell?"
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.860]   This encounter with these fake Jews
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.100]   who thought that they believed him,
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.780]   and Jesus encounters them in John 8, 44,
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:54.940]   and he goes straight to the matter too.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.220]   "You are of your father the devil,
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.100]   "and you want to do the desires of your father."
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.060]   Why is he so harsh?
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.900]   Why is he more gentle?
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.260]   He sees right through,
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.100]   and this is what he says in the verse,
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.460]   and the reason why he is so harsh with them,
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.920]   to therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance,
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.840]   and do not begin to say to yourselves,
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.140]   "We have Abraham as our father,
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.780]   "for I say to you that from these stones,
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.920]   "God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.620]   "Indeed, the ax is already laid at the root of the tree,
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.760]   "so every tree that does not bear good fruit
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.000]   "is cut down and thrown into the fire."
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.680]   He's cutting through their hypocrisy
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.420]   because they believed that they were safe,
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:44.280]   and the people who are in the most danger,
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   in our generation, are people who are in the church,
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.440]   may have been baptized superficially,
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.920]   maybe even serving in the church,
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.280]   maybe even leading in some sense,
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.400]   and yet they do not know God.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.760]   They do not know God,
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.520]   and so they could live their whole life
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.800]   thinking that they are in the front of the line,
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.120]   in the kingdom of God,
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.080]   and yet when the judgment comes,
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.160]   the judgment is the greatest to them.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.820]   John the Baptist was calling through all that fluff,
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.020]   all that deception,
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.860]   and he's cutting right through them.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:20.820]   He said, "You brood of viper,
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.740]   "who warned you to flee from the wrath that come?"
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.500]   You know, probably some of them were thinking
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.900]   that if they came, John the Baptist is becoming prominent,
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.220]   that so many people are going out to see him,
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.480]   and so they were so committed to their own glory
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.900]   that maybe if we attached ourselves to this prophet,
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.020]   maybe that's where we need to be.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.180]   So they were coming out to be baptized
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.300]   without genuinely repenting.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.920]   That's what he means.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.420]   Who told you to flee?
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.180]   You think that just going into the water and coming out
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.140]   is gonna cause you to be right with God
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.640]   because you're descendants of Abraham?
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.980]   There's a reason why he says, "You brood of vipers."
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.360]   You're not true descendants of Abraham.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.140]   The true spiritual,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:06.780]   the descendancy that you're from is Satan himself.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.280]   That's what he means by this,
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:13.500]   and he says the consequence of their fake repentance
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.340]   is that the ax is laid down to be cut down
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.120]   and be thrown into the fire.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.020]   Jesus himself says this in John chapter 15.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.900]   "Every branch in me that does not bear fruit,
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.180]   "he takes away, and every branch that bears fruit,
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.700]   "he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.260]   "If anyone does not abide in me,
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.820]   "and he is thrown away as a branch and dries up,
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.420]   "and they gather them and cast them into the fire,
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.800]   "and they are burned."
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.640]   Now, what is the consequence of somebody
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.880]   who has fake repentance and there's no fruit?
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.280]   He doesn't say he who does not bear any fruit
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.760]   that God is going to put him in time out.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.840]   He doesn't say if you don't bear any fruit
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.640]   that your repentance is fake.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.280]   It's only external, but there's nothing,
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.000]   no real transformation going on, no real fruit going on.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   He doesn't say you shouldn't be a leader
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.440]   or you need better discipleship.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.480]   He doesn't say that.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.320]   He said he who bears no fruit,
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.960]   he's gonna cut down and be thrown into the fire.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.800]   That doesn't sound like pruning to me.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.560]   That doesn't sound like better discipleship.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.080]   He says, no, you're in danger of hell.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.160]   That's what he's saying, right?
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.560]   You can be more clear than that.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.440]   Having no fruit or repentance is not just feeling bad.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.660]   Call to repentance is not to call,
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.880]   to feel bad about what you did this week.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.660]   I feel bad.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.900]   There's so much sometimes of our repentance is,
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.340]   hey, I struggle with pornography and I feel bad.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.800]   But thank God, thank God God is gracious.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.900]   And then you fall and then you go back two, three days later
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.020]   and you do go through the same act
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.460]   and you go over and over and over.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.900]   And all you're doing is commiserating with other people
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.380]   and never truly repenting.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:06.180]   Repenting is not feeling bad
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.580]   about the situation that you're in.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.620]   Repenting means to turn away, to put that away,
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.980]   to do everything in your power to put that away.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:20.920]   If we actually knew how God feels about sin,
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.860]   we wouldn't be so nonchalant.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.500]   You know, I know that there's people in this room
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.240]   who your internal clock is broken, right?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   And you almost say, I can't help it.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.580]   So we may have a meeting at 10,
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.300]   you show up at 10.15 or 10.20.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.020]   It's like almost predictable,
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.780]   you're gonna be 10, 15 minutes late.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.140]   I can't help it, I can't help it.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:46.940]   But no matter how broken your internal clock is,
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.780]   if you knew the serious consequence of being late,
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.180]   you will show up on time.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.940]   So I don't know anybody who is late to everything else,
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.360]   but it's also late to their flight, right?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.980]   'Cause if you're late to your flight,
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.260]   the door's closed and you're gone,
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.540]   whatever money you paid is squashed.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.300]   So I can't help it, I can't help it.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.460]   All of a sudden you can help it
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.380]   because you're afraid of the consequence.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.140]   Right, so I can't help it, I can't help it.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.300]   And all of a sudden you show up to work on time
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.300]   because if you don't show up to work on time, you get fired.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.940]   So it's not that you can't help it,
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:24.060]   but you don't think the consequence is serious enough
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.860]   to get to that point, right?
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.960]   If we understood how God views sin,
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.920]   we wouldn't be so nonchalant.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.240]   Call to repentance isn't simply,
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.640]   you should feel bad about where you're at.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.440]   You should feel bad.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.400]   That's exactly what John the Baptist was cutting through.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.680]   He said, "Go with the bare fruit with repent."
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.400]   If you're gonna genuinely repent, turn from your sin.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.840]   Instead of just saying, "I feel bad,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.400]   "I shouldn't have done that."
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.960]   That's what John is saying.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.620]   Years ago we were at Together for the Gospel,
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.180]   and at the Together for the Gospel,
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.900]   they would have the speakers come up
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.700]   and sit in circle or in a half circle,
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.780]   and they asked a question, Q&A session,
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.580]   and one of the questions that came in from the pastors was,
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:18.480]   "How would you counsel a guy in the church
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.600]   "who continues to struggle with pornography
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.560]   "and he just can't conquer his sin?"
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.340]   Right?
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.620]   "What would you counsel him?"
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:33.300]   And you know what John the Baptist, John Piper, right?
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.060]   I did the same thing first service.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.500]   John Piper basically said, "Tell him he's going to hell."
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.700]   The whole room just erupted in laughter,
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.100]   thinking like, "Oh, it must be a joke."
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:52.100]   So hyperbole, John Piper is just kind of joking,
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.140]   and after the laughter just started
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.140]   to die down a little bit, he said,
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.440]   "No, I'm dead serious.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.400]   "I'm quoting scripture."
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.660]   And then he took out Mark chapter 9, 43.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.520]   It says, "If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.180]   "It is better for you to enter life crippled
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.920]   "than having your two hands to go into hell,
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.480]   "into the unquenchable fire where their worm does not die
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.680]   "and the fire is not quenched."
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.500]   Jesus says that about the hand,
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.600]   about the foot, and about the eyes.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.680]   And so John Piper basically was answering
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.640]   that maybe he doesn't understand the consequence
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.720]   of continuing to sin without true repentance,
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.720]   that it may not be true, that his faith may not be true.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.980]   If he just confesses, like, "Oh, yeah, you know,
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.460]   "I didn't believe in God, but now I believe in God.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.700]   "I wasn't sure about the resurrection,
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.120]   "so now I do believe in the resurrection.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.900]   "I didn't believe these set of truths,
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.720]   "but now I believe in these set of truths."
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.160]   And the rest of it is, one saved, always saved.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.740]   And so how I live, what I do, what I invested,
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.980]   it doesn't matter anymore because one saved, always saved.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.400]   Pure rubbish.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.860]   If we read the scriptures for ourselves,
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.060]   and instead of having security over sermons
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.340]   and maybe articles or things that you've heard
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:13.420]   from other people thinking that your sin does not matter
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.780]   is an outright lie.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:20.140]   The same God who hated sin to the point where he abolished
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.660]   all of creation with the exception of eight
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.180]   is the same God that we will meet when we die.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.380]   He's not a lesser God.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.900]   He's not any less holy than that same God.
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.260]   He hates sin equally.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.060]   The same God who wiped out the earth
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.220]   warns us that when we meet him,
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:42.460]   unconfessed, unrepentant,
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:47.000]   it is the same holy, holy, holy God that you will meet.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.980]   And if anybody has convinced you otherwise,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.560]   they are a false prophet.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.840]   If you have convinced yourself that that is not the case,
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.580]   you do not know what the scripture says.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.880]   There is a reason why John the Baptist
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.540]   cut through all of that bull.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.840]   Because in order for them to be saved,
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.780]   they needed to know where they were.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.860]   If they left thinking they're secure
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:18.120]   because they have these external things that they're doing,
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.700]   you have given security to somebody who's going to hell.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:27.100]   That's why men of the past who preached the word of God
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.520]   preach with same kind of vigor.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.020]   John the Baptist preached crying in the wilderness.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:40.020]   He cried because he was crying for their salvation
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.020]   to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.200]   Jonathan Edwards, as you guys know,
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   gave a sermon called "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God."
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.060]   And it was a catalyst for the great awakening in America.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.320]   Revival broke out.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:58.420]   Consider what we consider a good sermon today
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.660]   versus Jonathan Edwards that caused the revival
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.180]   to break out in this country.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:08.620]   And I'm only giving you a very small snippet of his sermon.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.660]   He says this, "The God that holds you over the pit of hell,
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:15.700]   "much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:20.140]   "over the fire, abhors you and is dreadfully provoked.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.760]   "His wrath towards you burns like fire.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.040]   "He looks upon you as worthy of nothing else,
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.640]   "but to be cast into the fire.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.660]   "He is of pure eyes and to bear to have you in his sight.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.200]   "You are 10,000 times more abominable in his eyes
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.080]   "than the most hateful venomous serpent is in ours.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.440]   "You have offended him infinitely more than ever
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.480]   "a stubborn rebel did his prince.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.260]   "And yet it is nothing but his hand
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.060]   "that holds you from falling into the fire every moment.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.120]   "It is to be ascribed to nothing else
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.600]   "that you did not go to hell the last night,
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.700]   "that you were suffered to awake again in this world
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.320]   "after you closed your eyes to sleep.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.400]   "And there is no other reason to be given
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.200]   "why you have not dropped into hell
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.840]   "since you arose in the morning,
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.020]   "but that God's hand has held you up.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.520]   "There is no other reason to be given
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.040]   "why you have not gone to hell
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.320]   "since you have sat here in the house of God,
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.860]   "provoking his pure eyes by your sinful,
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.600]   "wicked manner of attending his solemn worship.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.500]   "Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.100]   "as a reason why you do not
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.200]   "this very moment drop down to hell."
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.600]   That's a very small portion of his whole sermon,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.920]   "Sin is in the Hands of an Angry God."
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.520]   Josh Moody, who is a historian of Jonathan Edwards,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.080]   writes about this particular sermon.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.340]   He says this, "On this day in history,
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.600]   "Jonathan Edwards started a sermon that he did not finish.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.220]   "Such was the impact of his preaching
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:40.260]   "that the people listening shrieked and cried out,
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.720]   "and crying and weeping became so loud
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.420]   "that Edwards was forced to discontinue the sermon.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.360]   "Instead, the pastors went down among the people
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.260]   "and prayed with them in groups.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:52.180]   "Many came to save and acknowledge of Christ that day."
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.460]   And it wasn't limited to his church.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.540]   Other pastors began to repent,
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.760]   and they began to preach warning.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.060]   And many, many people began to come
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.980]   and gave their life to Christ during this period.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.220]   In fact, so many people came to Christ,
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.360]   and there were so many raw emotions that broke out
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.620]   in the middle of these preachings
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.120]   that Jonathan Edwards actually had to write a book
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.100]   to clarify.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:20.140]   Religious affections.
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.380]   What is true repentance?
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.460]   What is fake repentance?
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.660]   There's a lot of people who are crying and being baptized,
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.700]   and so many things are happening,
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.100]   so he had to cut through all of that,
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.220]   and he had, if you've ever read that book,
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.880]   half of it is about this is fake.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.040]   You can cry and be fake.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.060]   You can go to church and be fake.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.380]   You can be a leader and be fake.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.420]   You can preach and be fake.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.420]   You can give and be fake.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:42.020]   You can become a missionary and be fake.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.180]   And then after he does that, he begins to break down,
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.100]   what does the Bible say about true repentance?
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.860]   What does true affection look like?
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.500]   We have become so familiar with sin in our generation
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:56.740]   that we are more concerned about offending sinners
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.980]   than offending a God who has been offended.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:03.420]   God is the one who is offended.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.400]   Not me and you.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.340]   You and I have received the grace of God.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:10.540]   He could have just wiped us away.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.720]   God's the one who's offended,
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.720]   but we're so concerned that we allow all kinds of sins
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.000]   to exist in the church,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.840]   and so concerned about sinners feeling uncomfortable
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.000]   with this type of preaching,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.520]   that we water down and misrepresent this holy God.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.580]   There is no reverence of God in our generation,
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.760]   because we have had to water it down
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.120]   to allow the sinners to feel comfortable
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.740]   in the midst of our fellowship.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:42.160]   It is not that God doesn't want sinners in the church.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.240]   It is not that God doesn't desire
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.760]   to have the sinners come to Christ,
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.080]   but they must come to Christ in his terms,
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.440]   in the terms that he has given us.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.480]   Not what we have created in our generation,
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.440]   not so that majority of them can come
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.520]   without feeling offended,
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.360]   but by the terms that he has created.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.700]   And the only way that we can get to him
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.200]   is through true repentance.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.500]   True repentance.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.500]   You cannot live day to day unrepentant
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.320]   and wanting to fit in at church.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.640]   You cannot be a part of the fellowship unrepentant,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.220]   week after week, year after year,
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.940]   and desire to be one of the group.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:24.780]   We cannot.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.460]   This is the body of Christ.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:31.300]   This is the temple of God.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.620]   And he who destroys a body,
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.400]   the Bible says the judgment is coming upon him as well.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:40.940]   Apostle Peter, after the resurrection of Christ,
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.220]   he began to preach the gospel.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.440]   And this is a man, before he met the resurrected Christ,
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.740]   was cowering in fear because he was afraid
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.300]   the same thing was gonna happen to him.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.020]   And yet, after the resurrection,
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.940]   being filled with the Holy Spirit,
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:57.320]   is speaking in front of a similar crowd
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.060]   that crucified him, says this.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.260]   Men of Israel, listen to these words.
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.460]   Jesus of Nazarene, a man attested to you by God
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.620]   with miracles and wonders and signs,
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.500]   which God performed through him in your midst,
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.720]   just as you yourselves know,
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.660]   this man delivered over by the predetermined plan
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.080]   and for knowledge of God,
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.020]   you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.380]   and put him to death.
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.140]   You're gonna say, well, some of you guys weren't there.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.480]   It's not really your fault.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.600]   Maybe it was the leader's fault.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.020]   You didn't really mean it.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.220]   You didn't really understand.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:35.140]   He cuts through all of that and said, no, you did it.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.260]   You turned on him.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.380]   You crucified him.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.180]   And the reason why he says that is because
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:43.780]   you can't repent if you don't own up to your own sins.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:47.780]   If you come to God and say, well, I am the way I am
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.060]   because of the way my mom treated me,
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.300]   that's not repentance.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.440]   I am the way I am because my leaders did this.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.460]   That's not repentance.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.340]   I did what I did because of my circumstance,
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.820]   because of my past,
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.020]   because I've been backstabbed by my friends,
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:02.320]   because of the fellowship.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.340]   That's not repentance.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.520]   Repentance is coming before God,
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.700]   beating our chest, asking for forgiveness.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.540]   It was me.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.480]   It was my corrupt nature.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.340]   It was my sin.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.020]   I did it.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.600]   I did it.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.220]   I wanted it.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.620]   I was lustful.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.860]   I was coveting.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.780]   I'm the one who lied.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.240]   I, it's me.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.820]   Versus the Pharisee who came up and said,
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.980]   well, thank God I'm not as bad as that guy.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:38.340]   See, until we recognize the need,
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.720]   the desperate need of a savior,
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.580]   it's just an encouraging message.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.160]   It's just a security blanket.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.060]   It's just insurance, just in case.
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:52.420]   After everything good that we've experienced here
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.980]   so that we can also have everything good afterlife.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.100]   But when we actually recognize who we are
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.980]   and what we have done and what we deserve,
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:07.060]   Christ is not somebody to be appreciated from a distance.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.020]   He is our life.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.260]   He's our life.
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.100]   Not just for eternity, but for today.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.620]   For today, I need him.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.780]   The anger, I can't overcome my own anger.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.020]   I need him.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.500]   I can't overcome my own lust.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.100]   I need him.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.860]   My bitterness, I can't.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.020]   I need him.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.580]   I need a savior to save me from my own sins.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.980]   When Peter preached this sermon,
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.140]   there are peers to the heart in verse 37.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.780]   So now when they heard this, they were peers to the heart
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.820]   and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles,
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.260]   brethren, what shall we do?
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.700]   Peter said to them, repent,
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.740]   and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.300]   for the forgiveness of your sins.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.540]   He says, repent.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.300]   Compare that to our generation.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.220]   When somebody wants to come to Christ,
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.020]   they say, well, find a good church.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.780]   Make sure you got a small group.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.380]   Make sure there's people your age, similar,
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.100]   that can walk with you, live with you.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.500]   Like, make sure you have similar doctrines
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.700]   and somebody near you so it's not so inconvenient
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.820]   that you have to drive so far.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.460]   Think about all the things that we tell people.
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.820]   Again, if all of those things are available, great.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.740]   Blessing to you.
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:23.980]   But the answer that he gave was repent.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.340]   Repent.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.540]   All that you need for a life of godliness
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.300]   has been given to you in the knowledge of his son,
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.220]   Jesus Christ.
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:35.700]   For those of you who already did Bible study, right?
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.380]   Everything that you need has been given to you.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:44.020]   So if you're sitting there in want,
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:48.740]   I can't because of this, I can't because of that.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:52.940]   That's an excuse, unwilling to repent.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.140]   If I can't pray, I can't pray
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.740]   because other people are not praying with me.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.700]   I can't pray because it's too hot in here.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.580]   I can't pray because it's too far.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:04.100]   I can't pray because I wasn't taught to pray.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   That's all an excuse.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.820]   'Cause he says everything that you need
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:13.020]   for a life in godliness has been given to you.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.740]   Not will be given to you, but it has been given to you.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.220]   And the only thing that we need to do
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:21.340]   to get to Christ is true repentance.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.940]   "Recognize our sins and repent,
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.660]   "and the doors will be opened."
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.180]   "Recognize our sins and repent,
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.340]   "and the mountains will be cut down,
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:34.780]   "and the ravines will be raised up," he says, "to repent."
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.020]   You know what's interesting is
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.820]   whenever strong sermons are given,
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:43.180]   the people who normally need to hear usually gets offended.
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:46.060]   And the people who I look at and say,
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.260]   "Wow, they're really doing well,"
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.400]   they're the ones who usually say,
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.620]   "Thank you for that sermon."
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.860]   That's exactly what happens here.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.860]   John the Baptist gives and he calls them out on their sin.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:01.140]   And the Pharisees and the leaders are offended.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.680]   And from that moment on, they're just like,
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.420]   "That guy is a false prophet."
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.500]   And they start distancing himself with him.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.620]   They didn't have to get rid of him
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:11.180]   because eventually Herod gets rid of him.
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.100]   But Jesus comes and he takes the baton
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:16.100]   and he goes even further than John the Baptist.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.900]   And they wanna make sure that this doesn't happen again.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.680]   So that's why they end up crucifying him.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.440]   Some of them are convicted to the heart.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.280]   In verse 10, it says,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.720]   "And the crowds were questioning him, saying,
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.800]   "Then what shall we do?"
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.820]   "If you're calling us out and my repentance is not genuine,
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.520]   "what shall we do?"
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.620]   He responds in verse 11,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.940]   "And he would answer and say to them,
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:39.720]   "The man who has two tunics is to share with him
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.960]   "who has none, and he who has food is to do likewise."
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.560]   If you look at Acts chapter two,
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.620]   that's exactly what happens.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.480]   People who are wealthy were selling their possessions
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   and they were passing it out
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:54.160]   and then people were living together, being generous.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.920]   Now, why does he point this out?
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.480]   I mean, Jesus himself said, "You can't serve two mammons."
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.320]   You can't have two gods.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.160]   Either you will serve money or you will serve God.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.120]   But you're not gonna do both.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.640]   If after claiming to know Christ
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.960]   and your spending habit is no different
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.120]   than somebody who does not know Christ,
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.340]   then maybe there was a repentance externally.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.560]   Maybe you were baptized, but it wasn't true baptism.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.100]   There's no fruit.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.680]   Now, the Bible didn't call everybody to live poor.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.460]   He didn't say you have to sell all your possessions.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.240]   Ananas and Sapphira actually get into trouble
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.140]   because of that, 'cause they pretended.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.260]   He said, "That wasn't required of you."
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.260]   But the reason why he points this out is because of that,
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.840]   that we can sacrifice what is less.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:45.140]   But he says, Jesus himself said,
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.360]   "Your heart is where your treasure is."
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.480]   So he said, "Take your treasure
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.500]   "and invest it in things that will last."
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.680]   And he goes on and he says,
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:02.400]   in Luke chapter three, verse 12,
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.680]   "And some tax collectors also came to be baptized
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.440]   "and said to him, 'Teacher, what shall we do?'
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.580]   "And he said to them, 'Collect no more
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.300]   "'than what you have been ordered to.'
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.920]   "Some soldiers were questioning him,
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.740]   "questioning him, saying, 'And what about us?
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:14.580]   "'What shall we do?'
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.060]   "And he said to them, 'Do not take money
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.780]   "'from anyone by force or accuse anyone falsely
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:21.540]   "'and be content with your wages.'"
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.020]   You know, one thing I wanna point out here
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:27.900]   is that he's referring to their jobs, right?
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.800]   Their jobs.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.480]   Because that's where they spend the most of their time.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.020]   You know, we kinda have a tendency to compartmentalize,
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.620]   like we're righteous at church,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.920]   but then that's where we turn it off, right?
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.560]   We're godly at church, but then at home,
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.460]   we're a completely different person.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.660]   Or maybe you're good at home,
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.420]   but then you're lousy at work.
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.260]   That's, for some reason, we compartmentalize
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.320]   where we bear fruit, and then the other parts
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.500]   where people are not watching, it doesn't really matter.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.500]   So he goes straight to them.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.700]   He doesn't say, "Make sure you come to the temple
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.300]   "more often."
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.700]   He said, "Make sure that your sacrifices are really clean,
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.660]   "you follow the order."
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.720]   And all of that is true, and it's important,
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.920]   but he goes straight to the matter
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.460]   where the rubber meets the road, it's at their job.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:22.720]   Make sure that there's true fruit in what you're doing,
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.840]   that the world may see that there was true
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.680]   baptism of repentance.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.240]   Let me wrap up this morning.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.840]   You cannot have peace of God without having peace with God.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.760]   Let me say that again.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   You cannot, it is impossible,
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   it is unbiblical to have peace of God
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.420]   without peace with God.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:51.000]   How much of your frustration in your walk with God
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.320]   that sometimes you blame God for
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.200]   is because you do not have peace with God.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:03.420]   You want to have a relationship with God on your terms,
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:08.440]   and God repeatedly tells you, "No, you cannot,
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.000]   "and you will not."
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.720]   You cannot come to God with unconfessed sins.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.900]   You cannot come to God when you sweep it under the rug.
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.880]   When you can, you cannot come to God
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.600]   if repeatedly all you are doing is feeling bad,
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.620]   and there's no true turning from sins,
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.100]   internally or externally.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:31.960]   You cannot have peace of God in your home.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.200]   You cannot have peace with God in your marriage.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.400]   You cannot have peace with God at church,
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.200]   with your relationships, until there is peace with God.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.720]   And the only way that you can have peace with God
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:50.280]   is true repentance, true repentance.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.880]   The good news of the gospel,
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.180]   isn't that a holy God looked at your sin and said,
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:55.880]   "You know what, I'm not gonna keep you accountable.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.320]   "I'm gonna die on the cross,
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.060]   "and then from that moment on, when you confess,
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.100]   "you don't have to worry about sin."
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.560]   That's not the gospel.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.800]   The gospel is, the good news is,
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.300]   that if you repent, He will forgive you.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.300]   That's the gospel.
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:13.280]   If you repent, He will forgive you.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.000]   It's not, if you feel bad, He will forgive you.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.840]   If you repent, He will forgive you.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.720]   Isaiah 29, 13, "Then the Lord said,
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.540]   "Because this people draw near with their words
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.960]   "and honor me with their lip service,
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.120]   "but they remove their hearts far from me,
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.900]   "and their reverence for me consists of tradition,
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.480]   "learn by rote."
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.900]   It just became habit.
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:41.420]   Everything I know about my walk with God is just habit.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:44.240]   But there's no true worship happening.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.100]   Jesus repeats those same words,
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.300]   Matthew 15, seven through nine,
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:54.600]   "You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.180]   "This people honors me with their lips,
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.220]   "but their hearts is far away from me.
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.300]   "But in vain do they worship me in teachings and doctrines,
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:04.200]   "the precepts of men."
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.240]   John the Baptist's message is loud and clear.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.460]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:16.200]   Jesus comes on the scene, He takes the baton,
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.880]   and He says, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.760]   He gave that baton to the apostles,
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.820]   and the apostles began to preach,
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.460]   "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:33.960]   And then He gave that baton to the pastors and evangelists
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.220]   and missionaries to say,
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:40.640]   "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.980]   Whether that is in the first century or 2,000 years later,
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:46.840]   the message has not changed.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.120]   Even if you don't hear it,
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.400]   even if it's not a popular message,
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.120]   the commission that we have been given
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.220]   to take to the world has not changed.
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:00.660]   We can only come to Christ
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.360]   by the road that He has paved for us.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.640]   Which is repentance, true repentance.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:14.120]   I pray that this message will be loud and clear to all of us.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.420]   Yes, we wrestle, we struggle, we get tempted, we covet,
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:23.760]   but do not ever think that that is okay.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:29.860]   The God who is holy, holy, holy calls us to Himself,
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:33.120]   and because of His grace,
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.500]   sinners who are undeserving, when we repent,
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.620]   will find refuge in Him, but we must repent.
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:44.040]   We must repent.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:48.880]   Let's pray.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:59.840]   Lord, we plead for Your grace.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   Lord, if we have become low to sleep in our compromise,
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:11.340]   I pray You would open our eyes.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:16.800]   As Paul's scales fell from his eyes
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.740]   and he repented was never the same.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.580]   Lord, help us.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:24.780]   Lord, we believe, help our unbelief.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.840]   Help us to see the things that we covet
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.920]   is leading us to destruction.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.920]   Help us to see and number our days,
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.960]   that all that we rejoice over is temporary.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.300]   Lord, help us, Lord God.
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:44.580]   Lord, all the time, energy, and money that we are putting in
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.580]   so that we can have a better retirement,
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.840]   help us, Lord, to see eternity,
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.080]   that we may invest in things, Lord God,
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.620]   that will never fade, spoil, or perish.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.620]   Lord, as You've called people to repent,
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:04.800]   to confess our sins, to cling to our Savior,
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.680]   that the only thing that can cleanse us
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:12.080]   from our own guilt is the blood of Christ,
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.640]   help us, Lord God, cling to Him with all our might.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:19.380]   Lead us, that we may honor You, worship You,
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.300]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.600]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.180]   (gentle music)
