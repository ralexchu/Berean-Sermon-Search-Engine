[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Good evening everyone. We're going to go ahead and get started with Bible study.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So why don't we take a couple of minutes to just prepare our hearts.

[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Father, we thank you so much for giving us this opportunity to meet,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   to worship you, to study your word.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   We thank you so much for Christ and Christ's example for us as we live on this earth.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   We pray as we study through your word, being reminded of Christ's humility and submission,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   that we ultimately submit to you and to your authority.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   We're reminded that Christ is our savior, but we pray that we would remember that Christ is also our Lord.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So we pray that we would submit to this Lordship and that we center our lives around giving you worship and honor and glory.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   We pray for tonight you would give us strength.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   We just pray for this time of praise that it would fill our hearts with gratitude
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and an ultimate reverence and respect for you.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So we love you and pray all this in your name.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Amen.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?

[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:51.080]   - All right, let me go ahead and open this up
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.340]   in a word of prayer,
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.240]   and then we'll get into this passage,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.800]   which I'm sure you guys have all kinds of thoughts on.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.680]   All right, so let me pray for us,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.380]   and I'll read for us 1 Peter 3 afterward.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.880]   Lord, we're very thankful that you are so kind
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.080]   and that you've provided for us
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.460]   a means and an access to God.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.760]   We thank you, Lord, that you didn't treat us fairly,
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.160]   but you treated us with compassion and mercy,
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.560]   and in turn, Lord, you're calling us to do the same
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.500]   toward those in our lives.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.420]   I pray that as we study today's passage,
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.280]   for some, this may be a lot more painful and sensitive
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.740]   than it is to others,
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.960]   but regardless of where we are,
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   just in regard to relating and interacting
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.560]   with this passage, would you speak,
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.460]   and would you minister,
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.240]   would you guide us and lead our time
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.960]   of both discussion and learning
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.820]   for all of these things we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.660]   I'm gonna read verses one,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.960]   and I'm gonna read through to verse nine,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.600]   just for context's sake.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:16.720]   In the same way, you wives, be submissive
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.040]   to your own husbands, so that even if any of them
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.580]   are disobedient to the word,
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.820]   they may be won without a word
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.200]   by the behavior of their wives,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.400]   as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.140]   Your adornment must not be merely external,
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.780]   braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry,
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.460]   or putting on dresses,
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.580]   but let it be the hidden person of the heart
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.900]   with the imperishable quality
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.180]   of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.340]   which is precious in the sight of God.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.940]   For in this way, in former times,
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.760]   the holy women also, who hoped in God,
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.380]   used to adorn themselves being submissive
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.940]   to their own husbands,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.420]   just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord,
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.220]   and you have become her children, if you do what is right,
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.140]   without being frightened by any fear.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.420]   You husbands, in the same way,
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.980]   live with your wives in an understanding way,
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.740]   as with someone weaker, since she is a woman,
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.900]   and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.340]   so that your prayers will not be hindered.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.640]   To sum up all of chapter two, verses 13 and on,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.320]   all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.400]   kindhearted, and humble in spirit,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.640]   not returning evil for evil or insult for insult,
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.680]   but giving a blessing instead,
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.480]   for you were called for the very purpose
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   that you might inherit a blessing.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.760]   So questions one and two are pretty standard,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.280]   and you guys are probably familiar with this.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   Question number three is something that I feel is important,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.420]   if you guys do have time to address.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.480]   What are the objections that rise up in and around you
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.620]   when you think through the ramifications of these verses?
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.380]   And in chapter two,
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.140]   he tells us to abstain from fleshly lusts, right?
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.900]   We're no longer living in our former ignorance
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.660]   of those fleshly lusts that we inherited
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.860]   from our forefathers.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.820]   So as you're looking at this text,
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.960]   which is very insensitive to our culture,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.780]   what are the knee-jerk reactions that rise up
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.700]   in your heart and for sure in the hearts of those around you?
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.740]   And this isn't something that you wanna avoid asking,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.980]   we wanna know how to answer them appropriately, right?

[01:21:40.580 --> 01:22:01.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:15.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.580]   - All right, let's gather back together.
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:23:04.580]   All right, let me pray for us,
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:08.580]   and we'll get the wrap-up portion started.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:17.580]   Lord, give us wisdom and insight into your truths.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   So that in the case of exceptions,
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.580]   that we would know how wisely to apply these verses
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.580]   into our lives.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   But for the day-to-day, the mundane,
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:35.580]   where it's more of our convenience and our pride
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.580]   that keeps us from obeying these words,
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.580]   I pray that you would cause us to be broken,
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:44.580]   and cause us to be tender-hearted before you.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   And so, Lord, over the next few minutes,
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.580]   would you really feed us,
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:56.580]   and help us to really glean much from this passage.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.580]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:08.580]   All right, as I do weekly,
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.580]   I'm just providing for you a little bit more
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:12.580]   of an adjusted outline.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:17.580]   So I included chapter 213.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   I took out some of the verses in the middle,
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.580]   but I included that part,
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:26.580]   because that's the primary command.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.580]   Okay, so the purple bowl, there's only that one.
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.580]   That's the major imperative, the submit yourselves.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:34.580]   Okay, for whose sake?
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:37.580]   For the Lord's sake.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.580]   So as worship, right, to glorify God.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.580]   Submit yourselves.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.580]   And then the green highlights that you see
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   are the attitudes and the things
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.580]   that are precious to God in regard to my attitude.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.580]   Okay, for the Lord's sake,
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.580]   conscience toward God,
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   your prayers will not be hindered.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.580]   And even that precious in the sight of God
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:02.580]   in the yellow there,
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.580]   I was debating whether to make it green or not,
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.580]   and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   It's just an outline.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.580]   It's an imperfect one, and that can be adjusted.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.580]   Okay, but the reason I do this
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:15.580]   is just so that it organizes the main thoughts in my head
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.580]   and keeps me focused on what's the main point.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.580]   And then the underlying stuff
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.580]   are all the human institutions.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:26.580]   We covered servants, masters a couple weeks back,
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.580]   and today we're looking at wives and husbands.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:34.580]   The red bolded words are the key words, okay?
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:38.580]   And remember, the not only to those who are good and gentle,
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.580]   and this is to the slave masters,
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:45.580]   but in the same way for the wife and the husband,
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.580]   kind of reminds me of that, right?
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:52.580]   So even if a husband is a punk, in the same way,
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.580]   even if a wife is the biggest bratty princess,
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.580]   even if the wife is abusive, in the same way.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:02.580]   So it kind of, not only to those who are good and gentle,
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   but also to those who are crooked,
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:06.580]   who are perverted, right?
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:12.580]   So it keeps me focused on the thrust of the whole thing.
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.580]   The peach text is the how,
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.580]   and there are a lot of hows for the woman.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:19.580]   And it's not because women need
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.580]   more biblical instruction than men,
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   but there are a lot of hows for the wives.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.580]   Winning over without a word,
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.580]   chaste and respectful behavior,
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.580]   gentle and quiet spirit,
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:38.580]   being submissive, obey, do what is right,
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.580]   without being frightened.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.580]   And it just, and again,
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.580]   I didn't look at like every participle, every word,
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:46.580]   and does this all belong in this column?
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:47.580]   I just put this together,
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   so that if I was to instruct my daughter
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.580]   on how to be a good wife,
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.580]   I immediately can go to this column, okay?
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:00.580]   The italicized stuff,
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.580]   just all the be submissives are in the participles,
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.580]   and even the live is in the participle.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.580]   Remember, the main verb is to submit yourself.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.580]   So that first column that you see
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:14.580]   is just in terms of the submission.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.580]   The second column is to whom to submit.
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   The third column are just the different subordinate ideas.
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.580]   And we're gonna look at today
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.580]   like this light blue highlight part,
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:28.580]   all of those words are phobos, like phobia.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.580]   They're all translated a bit differently.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.580]   But if you're reading through 1 Peter,
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:37.580]   you see the word phobos a lot, okay?
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.580]   And it's interesting because
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.580]   without being frightened by any fear,
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   the second word is not phobos.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.580]   That's the only one that's not phobos.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.580]   But what is this phobos?
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.580]   Okay, is it directed toward God,
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:50.580]   or is it directed toward men?
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.580]   And that's very important for us to understand
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.580]   who do we need to fear,
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:58.580]   who do we need to show fear to, okay,
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.580]   as we conduct our lives in fear.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:04.580]   And the yellow highlight are the charis with God
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:06.580]   that we looked at a few weeks back.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.580]   So when I look at this,
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.580]   it keeps me hedged in.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.580]   And in the blue in the middle
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.580]   is the italicized, just the example of Christ.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:20.580]   And I highlighted in the red, even if any.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.580]   Do you guys see that?
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:24.580]   Even if any.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.580]   So the Greek construction,
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.580]   the three words there,
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.580]   and the cultural study that I did
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.580]   as I was preparing this thing
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.580]   makes me feel like
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.580]   this church had a lot of men.
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.580]   Okay, so it's not like,
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:42.580]   if you go to church in China,
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.580]   if you go to the underground church,
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.580]   I've met people from churches
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.580]   where 99% of the church was women.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.580]   But in this context, I don't think that's the case.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.580]   Because culturally, it would be strange
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.580]   for a woman to be at church by herself.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.580]   That would take a bold woman.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.580]   Okay, in this context.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.580]   So there are a lot of men in here.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:06.580]   Just the grammatical construction of the Greek
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:09.580]   leads me to feel and slightly conclude
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.580]   that this is a big group of Christians,
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.580]   and then there are exceptional cases
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.580]   where the woman is there without her husband.
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:19.580]   All right, so that's why I highlight that in the red.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.580]   Now, just as a review of all of the stuff
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.580]   that we've been looking at,
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.580]   what is God's will for the Christian?
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.580]   We're trying to figure out if you're a Christian.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.580]   Actually, don't do that.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:37.580]   This is you, all right?
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.580]   I had a really quick second thought.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:44.580]   This is you if you profess faith in Christ.
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.580]   This is God's will for your life.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.580]   More important than your job,
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.580]   more important than who you will marry,
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.580]   if you're already married, I'm sorry.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.580]   More important than these big, lofty decisions,
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.580]   this is your life.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.580]   What is his call for you?
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.580]   And here are just a few, all right?
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.580]   1 Peter 1, 13-15.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.580]   "Therefore prepare your minds for action,
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.580]   "keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:07.580]   "on the grace to be brought to you
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.580]   "at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.580]   "As obedient children,"
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.580]   if you don't do these things, it's disobedience.
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.580]   "As obedient children, do not be conformed
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:18.580]   "to the former lusts, which were yours in your ignorance."
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.580]   Okay, your eyes have been opened now.
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.580]   "But like the Holy One who called you,
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   "be holy yourselves also in all your behavior."
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.580]   The word behavior, if you guys have noticed,
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.580]   nod your heads if you've noticed,
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:31.580]   it comes out a lot, conduct, behavior, behavior, behavior.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.580]   Okay, so 1 Peter 2, 15.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.580]   "This is the will of God, such is the will of God,
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.580]   "that by doing right, you may silence
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:40.580]   "the ignorance of foolish men."
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:42.580]   Similar theme as without a word,
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.580]   winning over a husband, right?
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   1 Peter 2, 19-21, which we looked at
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:48.580]   a little bit last week.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.580]   "For this finds favor for the sake of conscience
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.580]   "toward God, a person bears up under sorrows
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.580]   "when suffering unjustly.
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:55.580]   "For what credit is there if when you sin
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.580]   "and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience?
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.580]   "But when you do what is right and suffer for it,
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.580]   "you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.580]   "For you have been called to this purpose,
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.580]   "since Christ also suffered for you,
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   "leaving you an example to follow in his steps."
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.580]   It talks about Christ's suffering.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.580]   And remember the hoopoegramon, how do you,
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:19.580]   it's like a tracing, this is how Christ lived his life,
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:21.580]   so you follow that example because that's
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:25.580]   the purpose of God in your life.
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.580]   But you know what's a little bit painful?
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:30.580]   The first few words in chapter 3, verse 1 says,
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:36.580]   "In the same way, wives."
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.580]   Now I'm tense in my heart.
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:43.580]   Does this mean that a wife who is being hurt and abused
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:46.580]   stays in an abusive relationship,
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.580]   in obedience to the will of God,
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.580]   in following the example of Christ?
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.580]   Because the human mind goes there.
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:57.580]   Not just your mind went there.
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:59.580]   Yeah, it goes there.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.580]   So is that what it means?
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.580]   And that's why we have to be very careful
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:05.580]   to try to extract what God meant
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:08.580]   through Peter's writing of this letter.
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:11.580]   'Cause our mind naturally goes to the exceptions.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580]   And I'm gonna talk about that in a little bit.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.580]   But God's will for the Christian is,
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:21.580]   even if it means your harm, you live a good life.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.580]   Okay, that's, live a good life.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:28.580]   Live a holy life, live a submissive life,
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.580]   you live a life that is full of good conduct.
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.580]   Amen?
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.580]   Now what does that mean?
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:39.580]   Okay, now we have a hard time obeying it,
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:42.580]   just even if it's at risk for our inconvenience.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.580]   Okay, but even if it means harm,
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.580]   our attitude should be one of willingness
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:50.580]   to submit ourself, even if we know
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:54.580]   that that decision will lead to pain.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:58.580]   Okay, so that's the call of the Christian.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.580]   To save souls, to give glory to God,
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:05.580]   to build his church, to proclaim his excellencies,
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.580]   even at the risk of personal harm.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:12.580]   That's what it says in 1 Peter, okay?
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.580]   And so what are the ramifications?
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.580]   We'll get into a little bit of that today.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.580]   Okay, this, it might be small.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   You know, my eyes are getting bad.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.580]   So I'm like, I'm at that, it's weird,
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   now I have to, I'm doing one of these things, okay?
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   So if you can't see this, I'm sorry.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.580]   And as God's, in his fairness and justice,
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:37.580]   I used to make fun of fat, bald, and blind people.
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:41.580]   In his fairness, he's hit me with all kinds of stuff
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.580]   to sanctify me.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.580]   Anyway, my eyes are bad, so I'm sorry
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.580]   if you're having a hard time reading this.
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:50.580]   But I hit the word fabos, in a search.
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.580]   And if you look at how many times 1 Peter,
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:55.580]   just one through three has this,
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:58.580]   if you guys notice, chapter 117,
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.580]   "If you address his father, the one who impartially judges
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:02.580]   "according to each one's work,
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.580]   "conduct yourselves in," what?
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:08.580]   "Fabos," okay?
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:10.580]   "Honor all people, love the brotherhood,
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:13.580]   "fabos God, honor the king.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.580]   "Servants, be submissive to your masters with all,
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.580]   "fabos.
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.580]   "Wives, as they observe your chaste
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:25.580]   "and fabos behavior.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.580]   "Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord,
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.580]   "and you have become her children,
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.580]   "if you do what is right without being fabos,
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.580]   "by terror."
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.580]   Okay?
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:36.580]   So if you actually hear the original language,
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:38.580]   you hear the word phobia, fabos, quite a bit.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.580]   And then chapter three, verse 14 and 15,
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:44.580]   also include that.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   But is this fear toward man, like chapter three,
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.580]   verse two, "When they see your pure conduct with fear."
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.580]   Is that fear toward man?
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:54.580]   Like is a wife supposed to cower before her husband?
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:57.580]   Or is this a wife's fear of God that causes her,
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.580]   even at the risk of harm,
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.580]   and at the risk of her pride,
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:05.580]   to be willing to endure the criticism of her husband,
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.580]   the mistreatment of her husband,
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.580]   because she fears and loves God?
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.580]   So that's why this word is important.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:15.580]   And you're gonna see this word fear come up again.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.580]   And I did a study on that in chapter one,
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:20.580]   and we're not gonna cover it too much.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:23.580]   But just know that a lot of these reverence and respect
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.580]   and fear, a lot of those words are all one and the same,
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.580]   with slightly different nuances.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.580]   All right?
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:35.580]   Now, I wanted to give some just words
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.580]   on the first century family structure.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:45.580]   So in this culture, women were viewed as inferior to men.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.580]   They received little or no respect socially,
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.580]   economically, or politically.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.580]   And so this has been human history.
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:54.580]   And that's just how it has been,
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:56.580]   and that's one of the biggest ramifications
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.580]   of the fall of man, okay?
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.580]   In this period of time, there was a thing
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:07.580]   that you would understand as patria potestas.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:10.580]   That's the father's power,
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:15.580]   legal power over his kids, to the extreme.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:20.580]   The children, for a father, was like his property, legally.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.580]   Okay?
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.580]   And that power also applied to wives.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.580]   Adult women had few legal rights of their own.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:30.580]   They could not vote or hold public office.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.580]   And usually marriages in this time were arranged.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:38.580]   When the girl was somewhere between 12 to 14,
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.580]   an arrangement was made.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:45.580]   So this is not like freedom for you to isogete
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.580]   and be like, "Oh, if I'm a Christian woman,
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.580]   "and that's a non-Christian man,
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:54.580]   "maybe this is a verse I can use to say,
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:55.580]   "'See, I can get married to him.'"
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:58.580]   No, we're not looking at that, okay?
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:02.580]   In this context, most marriages were arranged
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:06.580]   for some kind of political reason, okay?
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:09.580]   So in this culture, a wife becoming a Christian
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:13.580]   without her husband was a big deal.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   A husband likely is going to be socially embarrassed
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:23.580]   and shamed by this perceived act of defiance by his wife.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:29.580]   So in this situation, a wife needed to be very prudent, okay?
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:34.580]   Women often had social clubs where they shared gossip, okay?
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:38.580]   There was a bathhouse hour where the women gathered together
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:43.580]   to gossip and to talk religion and to do what women do
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.580]   when they're a bunch of them gathered together.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.580]   And I'm going to leave it at that, or I'm going to get in trouble, okay?
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:54.580]   And women generally are more interested in religion than men.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:56.580]   Agree or disagree?
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.580]   Yeah, okay?
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:00.580]   So there are a lot of religious cults on this side.
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:06.580]   There's a polygamous culture, but women were more religious.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:11.580]   They would end up with these little fan clubs of these different gods.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:19.580]   And so religiosity in many ways was like a hobby in this culture.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:24.580]   Usually the family's religion was the father's decision
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:26.580]   and the father's choice.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:29.580]   You guys following along?
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:36.580]   So if a man is a polytheist and his wife meets Christ
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:41.580]   and she wants to have him convinced that Christ is the only way
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:45.580]   because she's met him, she's encountered him,
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:49.580]   that's very tricky and that's very difficult.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:53.580]   But when a man meets Christ and he comes to faith,
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:57.580]   his whole family usually follows suit.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.580]   Are you guys following that?
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:00.580]   That's why when I'm reading this, I'm like, okay,
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:03.580]   this is not a church where it's like 99% women.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.580]   There's a lot of men in here.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.580]   For the wife, there are a lot of social ramifications
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:11.580]   if she just chooses to say forget my husband
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:16.580]   and let me do my church thing.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:20.580]   Culturally, women sought to submit well
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:26.580]   because remember, in some ways, they were property in this time.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:32.580]   So if I was a very good wife, I would want to submit well
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:37.580]   so that my husband can treat me as a trophy wife
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:45.580]   and so my husband can be honored and famed for whatever the reason.
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:48.580]   And in this period of time, most adornment for women
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:53.580]   was usually the societal norm or modest adornment.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:57.580]   So this wasn't talking about like some very radical idea.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.580]   All of a sudden, like Peter says, dress appropriately.
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:05.580]   Don't worry about your hair or like all this other stuff.
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:08.580]   Now, Plutarch is a very famous Greek philosopher,
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:11.580]   and this is what he said.
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.580]   "A wife should not acquire her own friends
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.580]   but should make her husband's friends her own.
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:20.580]   The gods are the first and most significant friends.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:23.580]   For this reason, it is proper for a wife to recognize only those gods
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.580]   whom her husband worships and to shut the door
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:30.580]   to superstitious cults and strange superstitions."
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:36.580]   And he was contemporaneous to the situation of 1 Peter.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.580]   You guys on this?
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.580]   Hopefully, this gives you a little bit more insight
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:45.580]   into the dynamics of the household in 1 Peter.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:51.580]   And I think that's why there are six verses for the wife
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:53.580]   because it's a lot trickier for a wife
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:56.580]   to try to submit herself to Christ
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:01.580]   going behind what may feel like her husband's back
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:06.580]   than for a husband to not be selfish and to be considerate.
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:07.580]   Okay?
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:09.580]   All right, you guys gave me some kind of feedback.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.580]   You guys get that, right? Okay.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.580]   Now, this is what this passage is not saying.
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.580]   I figured this would be a more helpful wrap-up, okay?
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:22.580]   This is what this is not saying.
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:28.580]   This passage is not saying that all women
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:33.580]   should be subject to all men.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:34.580]   Okay?
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:38.580]   Some Christian organizations, like churches, whatever,
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:41.580]   they might have, like--okay, not churches.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:44.580]   A church has structure because God--1 Corinthians 14, 33--
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:47.580]   God is not a god of confusion but of order, okay?
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.580]   So there are different functions.
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:52.580]   But this passage is not saying that all women
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.580]   should be subject to all men, okay?
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:57.580]   The second thing is the relationship between husband and wife
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.580]   is parallel to the relationship between master and slave.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.580]   See, in the same way.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.580]   That's not what it's saying.
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.580]   The relationship between master and slave,
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.580]   that's a human institution.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:10.580]   The relationship between husband and wife, Genesis 1:27,
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:15.580]   God created man and woman in His own image.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.580]   Genesis 2:18, what does He do?
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.580]   He brings them together as a family.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:21.580]   It is not good for a man to be alone, all right?
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.580]   So this is not the same.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:28.580]   This is not saying it's okay for a Christian woman
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:32.580]   to marry a non-Christian man, or obviously vice versa.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:33.580]   All right?
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.580]   So some people who want to make some kind of a justification
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:40.580]   might use this.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:43.580]   Holy wives address their husbands as Lord.
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:48.580]   I'm not going to go home today and be like, "Beggay."
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:52.580]   Did you study this week's passage?
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.580]   From now on, you don't call me babe, honey, yubba, or nothing.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.580]   You call me Lord.
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:59.580]   No.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:03.580]   Okay, there are cultural nuances to this.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:07.580]   But her calling Him Lord is in a present participle tense.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:13.580]   It means this was her natural demeanor.
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:15.580]   Some of you guys, I'm sure you guys argued about,
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:16.580]   "Well, does that mean--?"
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:19.580]   Because he asked her to lie twice, right?
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.580]   She threatened him and pressured him,
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.580]   and then he related with Hagar, out came a child,
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.580]   and then she got mad at him for listening to her.
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:28.580]   What is a man to do, right?
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:31.580]   All of that stuff.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:38.580]   But generally, because for her, this man has been chosen by God,
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:40.580]   has been blessed by God,
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:45.580]   and me as a subordinate helper to this man,
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.580]   beyond all the cultural stuff,
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:51.580]   I will do my best to elevate this man.
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:54.580]   That was her natural disposition.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.580]   So she was regularly calling him Lord.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.580]   Some commentators say, "Genesis 18.12.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:01.580]   In that case, oh, shall I--?"
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:03.580]   He addressed him as Lord at the promise of the baby
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:04.580]   and all that stuff.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.580]   But when I just look at the tense, it's like, look,
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   that was her natural disposition toward her husband.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.580]   External beauty is of no value.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:19.580]   External adornment is a sin, is not what it's saying.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.580]   Amen?
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.580]   That's so funny that came from a dude.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.580]   [laughter]
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.580]   Yeah, it's okay to beautify yourself.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:32.580]   But when beautifying yourself becomes your idol,
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:36.580]   when attention from men or attention from other ladies
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.580]   becomes your primary focus,
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:41.580]   then you've got some other issues that you work with.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.580]   Same thing for guys.
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.580]   I don't think this is only for the girls.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:50.580]   Your buffness should not merely be external.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   Work out the inner man, right?
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:56.580]   Rather than just working out your pecs.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:00.580]   So I've been focusing on working out the inner man.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.580]   Okay, so--but external beauty is of value.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:07.580]   This does not mean a wife can be like,
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:10.580]   "Oh, after I'm married, like, it doesn't matter what I look like."
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:13.580]   No, please brush your teeth, brush your hair, do stuff.
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.580]   Okay?
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.580]   So external beauty is of value,
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:20.580]   but let your beauty not just--let your adornment
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:23.580]   not just be that of the external.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.580]   All right?
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.580]   It is a noble thing for a woman to remain married
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:31.580]   to an abusive husband is not what this is saying.
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:35.580]   So I actually looked into--because I was curious
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.580]   what domestic violence laws and things look like
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.580]   in the Roman society.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:43.580]   It's very similar to what you and I live in today.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:48.580]   Does domestic violence happen in today's cultural context?
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:51.580]   Yes. Is it illegal?
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:53.580]   Yes, it was illegal then.
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.580]   But domestic violence does not happen in the public square.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:00.580]   Domestic violence does not happen just, like,
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:03.580]   where everyone knows.
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:06.580]   In a society where arranged marriages are the thing,
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.580]   domestic violence is actually a little bit more
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.580]   of a shameful thing.
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.580]   There's a lot at stake when the families
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.580]   are arranged in marriage.
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:17.580]   So there was a lot of domestic violence,
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:21.580]   but not as much as you would think.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:24.580]   So it's similar to today's context.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:27.580]   So if my daughter were to tell me that her husband
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:32.580]   struck her, I wouldn't say that it's a noble thing
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.580]   for her to just go in there, right?
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:38.580]   To stay there.
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:41.580]   There are many different things that we need to consider
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:44.580]   and talk through, and those are case by case,
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.580]   but where we need more scriptural knowledge,
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.580]   we definitely need more spiritual wisdom
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:51.580]   to know how to counsel this woman.
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:55.580]   If I am an abused woman, to know how to proceed.
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:58.580]   Because even in scripture, like we talked about
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:04.580]   at our table, if a man cheats on his wife,
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:09.580]   the wife can leave her husband, right?
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:17.580]   But if she chooses to remain to minister to him,
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:21.580]   the Bible allows her to do so.
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:28.580]   I think most women would be more pained
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:32.580]   by a man cheating on her than by him hitting her.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.580]   True or false?
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:37.580]   We need to use discretion and wisdom
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:40.580]   before we just blanket apply passages like this
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:43.580]   to the sisters in our church and our culture.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.580]   And we need to protect.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.580]   But that's kind of a sensitive and tricky thing.
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:51.580]   Right?
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:52.580]   It wasn't this time.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:55.580]   So when you say, "Well, in the same way," right?
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.580]   We have to be a little bit cautious
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:01.580]   when we try to do that, all right?
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:03.580]   Lastly, chapter three, verse seven,
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:05.580]   talking about the weaker vessel.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.580]   Some ladies, like, I'm sure,
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:11.580]   it raised some colorful discussions.
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:14.580]   That's why we have separate men and women,
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:17.580]   except my group, okay?
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.580]   This is not saying that women are inferior to men.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:22.580]   The Bible, nowhere in the New Testament
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.580]   does it ever teach that.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:28.580]   Intellectually substandard or more prone to wickedness?
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:30.580]   They're more, they're like, they're weaker.
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.580]   So they're more prone to evil.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:34.580]   That is not the case.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:36.580]   There's a different function,
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:39.580]   and if there is weakness, it could be societal,
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:44.580]   it could be physical, but it's not in worth.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.580]   You get that?
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:46.580]   Okay?
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:50.580]   So that's what this passage is not saying.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:53.580]   Now, there's a lot that we can go into this.
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:56.580]   It's a lot of, there's a lot of counseling involved
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:58.580]   in trying to dissect every aspect of this passage,
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:01.580]   so we're not gonna do that just for the sake of time.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:08.580]   But the word fear, who are we to fear more, God or man?
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:09.580]   The one who can kill the body,
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:11.580]   or who can send both the body and soul to hell?
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:13.580]   Who are we to fear more?
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.580]   God.
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:16.580]   Who's more powerful, God or man?
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:17.580]   God, thank you, TJ.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.580]   Is that TJ a student?
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:22.580]   Yes, God, right?
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:25.580]   Are we serving a tyrant of a God,
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:29.580]   or a God who is perfectly good and is perfectly loving?
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:31.580]   The latter, right?
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:34.580]   So as we're wrestling through these things
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.580]   and trying to figure out, like, okay,
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:40.580]   day to day, this is not hard to apply.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.580]   Men, we need to stop being inconsiderate,
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:45.580]   and like little boys, okay?
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:48.580]   We need to really be protective and sacrificial
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.580]   with our wives, with our emotion,
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.580]   with our time, with everything.
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:55.580]   We need to die to ourselves for the sake of our wives
[01:49:55.580 --> 01:49:56.580]   and for our family, okay?
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.580]   That's common sense.
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:04.580]   Women, it's an art to raise up and elevate your husband
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.580]   as the head of the house.
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.580]   If you've gotten into a habit of tearing your husband down
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:11.580]   or nagging him all the time,
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.580]   or just cutting down his worth,
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:15.580]   or purposely mocking him by saying,
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:19.580]   "Well, the Bible, I know, says to submit,
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.580]   "but you're making bozo decisions.
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:23.580]   "I'm not gonna submit to no bozo," right?
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:28.580]   In those situations, you need some counsel.
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:34.580]   Even in those situations, the call is to submit.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.580]   I'm not gonna go as far as I call him Lord, right?
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:39.580]   But you need to submit,
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:42.580]   even when you think he's doing it all wrong, okay?
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.580]   That's the day to day common.
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.580]   In the exception cases,
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:49.580]   we're gonna do that case by case, all right?
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:51.580]   Now, we're serving a good God
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.580]   who has our best interest in mind.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:56.580]   He is not a God of confusion or of chaos.
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:00.580]   He is a God of peace and order.
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.580]   And he is all powerful,
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:06.580]   and this is something we covered a few weeks back
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:10.580]   about what this God has done for you
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.580]   and is continuing to do
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:15.580]   for those who submit to his lordship in their lives.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:18.580]   All right, I'm just gonna read that.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:20.580]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.580]   "who according to his great mercy
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:26.580]   "has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.580]   "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:33.580]   "to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled,
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:37.580]   "will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:41.580]   "who are protected by the power of God through faith
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.580]   "for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.580]   "In this you greatly rejoice,
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:52.580]   "even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.580]   "you've been distressed by various trials.
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:57.580]   "Why? So that the proof of your faith,
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:01.580]   "being more precious than gold which is perishable,
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.580]   "even though tested by fire,
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:06.580]   "may be found a result in praise and glory and honor
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:09.580]   "at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:14.580]   If you haven't noticed, there are many similar words used here
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:16.580]   as they are used in today's passage.
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:18.580]   Imperishable, precious.
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.580]   You guys following that?
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:21.580]   Okay.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:29.580]   So this is not next week.
[01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:31.580]   Next week is Passion Week.
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.580]   So we'll see you Monday through Wednesday for devotions here
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:36.580]   and then Thursday for a Passover meal
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.580]   and Friday for the Good Friday service.
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:40.580]   But this is for April 20th.
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:42.580]   We're doing nine verses.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.580]   That's the most we've ever done.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:46.580]   Okay?
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:47.580]   But you have two weeks.
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:49.580]   So you can do four and a half a week.
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.580]   All right?
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.580]   So chapters 3 verses 8 to 16,
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:56.580]   2 to 4 are pretty much the same.
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.580]   Question number 5 is,
[01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:02.580]   "What does it mean for you to sanctify Christ as Lord in your heart?"
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:04.580]   It sounds nice.
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.580]   It sounds very, like, photo-frame--like, frame-worthy.
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:11.580]   But what is that, to sanctify Christ as Lord in my heart?
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:13.580]   Always being ready to make a defense.
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.580]   Okay, what is that?
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:16.580]   Okay?
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.580]   And then today, I want to--
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.580]   in the discussions that you have with your small group members,
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:24.580]   if you're married,
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:29.580]   in what specific areas do you need help in better applying these verses?
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:33.580]   Any sins to confess or practical applications to make.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:37.580]   You don't want today's study just to be an academic exercise.
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:40.580]   How do we apply this in our marriage?
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:44.580]   If you're unmarried, in what practical ways do you need to improve
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:50.580]   in the way you are interacting with the human institutions nearest to you?
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:53.580]   Because regardless of whether you're married or not,
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:58.580]   your beauty and your macho beauty,
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:01.580]   it needs to be that of the inner self, the inner man.
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:03.580]   Right?
[01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:07.580]   So what areas do you need wisdom and improvement?
[01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:10.580]   Secondly, are there specific ways your group members can pray for you
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:15.580]   as you grow in fearing God over consequence?
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:17.580]   And that's how I characterized it.
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:19.580]   Fearing God will lead you to certain things.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:24.580]   Fearing consequence will lead you to other applications.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:26.580]   All right?
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:27.580]   Okay.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.580]   So I'll give you guys time to break up into your groups,
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:32.580]   but let me pray close for us,
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:37.580]   and then we'll wrap up the teaching portion.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:39.580]   Lord, give us wisdom.
[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:42.580]   Give us humility.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:50.580]   And lead us to genuinely consider others more significant than ourselves.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:55.580]   Help us to look after not only our own needs but to the needs of others.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:55:01.580]   Help us to imitate Christ in every way that we can.
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:08.580]   And, Lord, in the event you lead us to suffer for good,
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:14.580]   I pray that you would give us joy, that you would guard our hearts,
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:18.580]   and, Lord, that our response to those painful circumstances
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:22.580]   really can give you the glory that you are due.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:27.580]   Help us in times of peace and in times of suffering

[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:34.580]   For you are the God who has called us out of darkness into his marvelous light.
