[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   I want to strongly encourage and remind you, both of you guys, all the people who are here
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.000]   and also the recordings, the people who are listening at home, to do your best to at least
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.800]   read it a few times before you come so that when we talk about certain things, at least
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.400]   you're aware of what they are.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.720]   Even if you didn't understand it, if you knew what the issues were, it wouldn't go over
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   your head as much.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.400]   So, again, I just want to strongly encourage you to do that because there's so many things
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.400]   that I'm talking about.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.400]   Can this be lowered just a little bit?
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.880]   There's so many little nuances.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.720]   The benefit of studying the book of Leviticus is the details, the details and the significance
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.520]   of these things.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.600]   So if you miss these details, again, what you're going to keep hearing over and over
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   again is that the sin needs to be atoned for.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400]   We need to be cleansed.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.880]   Don't eat this and eat that.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.480]   Don't touch this, but you can touch that.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480]   That's what you're going to get.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.160]   Basically, you just studied the book of Leviticus.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   If you studied the book of Leviticus as just kind of a general overview.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.320]   So the meaning behind the details of what he says is what the foundation, the understanding
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.680]   of salvation and the result of salvation that it points to.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.240]   So if you don't know the details and you're not catching the details, then yeah, I mean,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.120]   the book of Leviticus is just, you're going to leave it with the same thing that you came
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   in with it.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   It's a difficult book.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.760]   It's hard to understand.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   Okay.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.920]   So, again, it's just an encouragement to you to do your best to read it a few times, know
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.800]   the details, at least know the outline so that when I say that this offering is a bull
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   offering and so what is the distinction between this bull offering and the goat offering and
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.040]   how is it different from the peace offering and the burnt offering?
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.920]   Like what is the significance of the burnt offering?
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.240]   So again, that was just an encouragement.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.440]   Let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:14.680]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.160]   You are a gracious and patient God.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.240]   Everything that you command us, we know that it has meaning.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   It prepares us.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.800]   It points to Christ.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.320]   It gives us strength, Lord God, to live lives that are Godly.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:39.480]   We desire to reflect who you are in how we think, what we do, what we pursue.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.400]   I pray, Father God, that the washing of our regeneration will be more than just the general
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:54.000]   push, Lord, to heaven, that the more we understand who you are, that those are the very things
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.240]   that we would pursue with all our might.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.720]   We pray that you would bless the time that we have and that your word would have a powerful
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.600]   impact on our heart, that our fellowship would cause us, Lord God, to be spurred on toward
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   you.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.720]   Thank you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.160]   Amen.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.760]   So if we were to look at Leviticus chapter 4, 5-13, obviously we're talking about the
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.160]   sin offering.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.440]   Generally speaking, what is the purpose of these sacrifices?
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.720]   Think about it.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   You don't have to answer it.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.120]   It's a rhetorical question.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.880]   I just want you to think about it.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.960]   To atone for sins, to deal with the particular sins of God's people.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.360]   But what is the purpose of that?
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.120]   You won't be judged.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.000]   Remember we talked about that in the very beginning, in introduction, how the book of
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.800]   Exodus ends, and then how Leviticus is introduced, and then how God speaks in the book of Numbers?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.360]   You remember?
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   Think carefully.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:23.920]   Is it uncomfortable?
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   I want you to review in your mind again.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.440]   What is the purpose of the book of Leviticus?
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.000]   What is the purpose of these sacrifices?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.560]   Remember how we ended the book of Exodus?
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.360]   What was God doing at the end of Exodus?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.000]   What is God doing in the book of Numbers?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.520]   And so what is God doing in Leviticus?
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.700]   If you remember carefully, you'll probably remember it because I said it so many times
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.800]   in our introduction.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.160]   What was unique about the beginning of the book of Numbers?
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.680]   Where is God speaking from?
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.320]   Inside the tent, right?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.600]   Where is God speaking from in Leviticus?
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.480]   From the tent, right?
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.440]   They weren't able to come in yet, right?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.720]   He's speaking from the tent.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.600]   And so the book of Exodus, he came down from the mountain, he's dwelling, right?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.720]   He's about to make his dwelling on the tent, in the tent, right?
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.080]   Leviticus begins where he's in the tent.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.000]   Number tells us that he's in and he invites people to come into the tent, right?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.040]   So you see this progression of a holy God who's drawing near to his people and he's
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.360]   preparing all of these sacrifices for what purpose?
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   To atone for our sins.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.720]   But why is he atoning for our sins?
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.040]   Huh?
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.680]   To draw closer so that a holy God can dwell with sinful people.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.200]   That's the whole reason why sins are being atoned for because a holy God and sinful people
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.840]   cannot be in the same place.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.000]   So the only way that God could be with his people is through the atonement of their sins.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.120]   And so that's what all this is for, is so that God can dwell with us.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.840]   Now, think about the purpose of salvation.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.360]   If the purpose of atonement is so that he can dwell with us, what is the purpose of
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.800]   salvation?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:30.160]   Why did Jesus atone for our sins?
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.840]   For atoning for our sins, to keep us from hell, so that the wrath of God may be covered,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.260]   all of that is true, but what is the ultimate purpose?
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.360]   To restore his presence in our lives, right?
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.880]   Because all the judgment that we know, hell, wrath of God, all of this came as a result
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.480]   of being separated from God because of our sins.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.280]   Because sin and God cannot dwell together.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.760]   And so there had to be an answer to the sin, and that's why God was atoning for our sins.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.520]   So this whole drama in the book of Exodus, Leviticus, book of Numbers, Deuteronomy, all
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.040]   of it is to deal with man's sin in order for the holy God to draw near to us.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.400]   Right?
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.520]   Now I want you to keep that in mind because that gives you the overarching purpose of
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.120]   salvation.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   So if you say that you are saved and your sins are atoned for and yet there is no evidence
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.240]   of your relationship with God, you know we say, cliche, it's not a religion, it's about
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.080]   relationship, all that is true, right?
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.160]   But where's the evidence, right?
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.520]   So if God atoned for sins and yet he never shows up, there's no need for atonement because
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.400]   if God is not there, there's no need for atonement.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.120]   Only reason why they need atonement is because God and sinful man can't be together.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.960]   And the reason why there's hell is because the ultimate ramification of sin and holiness
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.280]   when we die is going to be separated permanently.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.200]   As far as it can be separated from God's presence.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.760]   That's what hell is, ultimately.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:11.880]   So the book of Leviticus is a detailed description of how he's going to deal with sin.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.640]   So he doesn't just say, you know what, you're rebelling against God, God's going to cover
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.720]   you.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.000]   He does do that, generally speaking, but he goes into detailed explanation of what sin
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.400]   and how he's going to cover this sin.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   What is his view about this sin?
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.480]   What does he think about when you sin?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.240]   What does he think about when he sins or she sins or they sin?
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.280]   What particular animal is going to be sacrificed for whose sin and for what purpose?
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.200]   And what area of the temple needs to be cleansed because of your sin?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.480]   So every one of these things is a detailed description, like a surgeon going in.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.840]   He doesn't just cut in, it's like, oh is that where the cancer is?
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.680]   He just rips it open, just yanks it out.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.120]   He's identifying like a surgeon.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.280]   The detailed part of what sin is he dealing with.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.600]   So in each one of these sacrifices, it's like God is looking through a microscope and he's
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.260]   causing you to look through it and it is revelation of how God sees sin and what God is going
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.600]   to do to deal with that sin.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.040]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.320]   So typically when we think of sin, we just think of sin or we've fallen short of God's
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.880]   glory, but the way that God describes sin is much more precise than that.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.360]   And I think part of the reason why there is this general just kind of brushing over sin
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.300]   and a general brushing over atonement and why our salvation and redemption, why a lot
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:43.260]   of people, it doesn't hit us like it ought to, is because we have a very elementary understanding
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.880]   of sin.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.080]   And we have a very elementary understanding of our salvation.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.640]   God loved us unconditionally, Jesus died for our sins, the end.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.680]   Only true, right?
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   But that's just like saying one plus one equals two, so now I know math.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.920]   That's the beginning.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.360]   But the more detailed you look at it, you start building on top of that where God begins
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.920]   to reveal what he sees and his remedy for that.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.200]   So the end result of that, that you have a clear understanding of what Jesus did on the
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.080]   cross and what it is that exactly he accomplished.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.560]   So all of this to say is that the details are important.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.120]   And so I want you guys to wrestle with the details.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.800]   Even if you don't have the answers, I want you to ask the details.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   Because God didn't just give these details to confuse us.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.760]   These details point to something.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   Some of it we are aware of, some of it is a guess, some of it may remain a mystery.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.000]   But the more you ask, the more you search, the more you're going to be able to understand
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.440]   what God thinks of sin and how he remedies that.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.920]   The purpose of the sin offering.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.800]   The purpose of the sin offering is atonement for sins, was for Holy God to dwell among
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   sinful people.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.900]   It was not simply to help people live a better life.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.500]   And that is no different today, as I have already mentioned.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:19.520]   The whole purpose of redemption is so that we can draw near to him.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.760]   He drew near to us because we couldn't draw near to him, so in order that we may draw
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.960]   near to him.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.280]   That's the whole purpose of atonement.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.760]   So if you enjoy your salvation from a distance, you don't really understand what you have
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.760]   in Christ.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:42.100]   I summon a reasonable response when we understand what it is that we have in him is to make
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.680]   every effort to come to him if he really is our life and treasure.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.840]   So the purpose of all the sin offerings, all the offerings, was so that Holy God could
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   deal with us.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.400]   Specifically, sin is not only a breaking of the law, but also pollution.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.000]   And I think this particular offering details that.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.400]   It points to that.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.520]   Sin is not just, I broke the law and so I should have gotten an A, but I got a B or
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.560]   got a C or got a D or got a F.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.320]   Sin actually ends up polluting.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.440]   Part of the reason why there is attraction to sin is because we don't understand what
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   sin is.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.080]   We think, "Oh, we did something we shouldn't have done, so we did it.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.920]   We confessed our sins and we're done with it."
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.880]   I used this illustration before, but part of sanctification is recognizing sin from
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.840]   God's perspective.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.040]   If you were eating something that you wouldn't normally eat, so I don't want to ruin your
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.120]   appetite, but let's say, I'm just going to, hot dog, right?
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.680]   Let's say as an hot dog, because this is the reality, there's a certain amount of excrement
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.120]   that they allow in these hot dogs.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.920]   And this is a reality, right?
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.200]   I think this is universal knowledge by now.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.160]   They can't 100% clean it, so they allowed a certain amount, certain small, small percentage
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.080]   of rat excrement to enter into that.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.120]   And it's not going to affect your health.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.640]   It's sanitized, but it's in there.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.800]   It's common knowledge now.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.640]   You can Google it.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.680]   But imagine if that was increased to 10%.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.960]   Let's not get carried away.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.440]   5%.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.920]   Okay, let's be real.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.640]   Let's say 1%.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.040]   There's excrement in there.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.200]   1% of the hot dog that you're eating is excrement.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.920]   How many of you would eat that hot dog?
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.680]   Some of you guys might.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.600]   It might not be a good illustration.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.440]   Most of us will not eat it, because the thought of eating excrement is going to keep you away,
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.320]   unless you're starving to death, and the only way to survive is to eat this hot dog, right?
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.080]   The reason why he goes through this detail of describing these sins is because he's trying
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.560]   to show us the excrement of these sins.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:19.200]   And when our understanding of sin is from his perspective, it would be like running
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.000]   to sin is like running to dung.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.720]   It's like, "Well, this is enjoyable."
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.240]   Remember how James describes it?
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.680]   A man who repents and falls back is like what?
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.440]   It's like a dog returning to his vomit.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.200]   That's how God describes a man who runs back to his sin.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.560]   But that vomit is the sin.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:51.760]   So the whole point of all of this is to reveal to us that sin to a holy God and to holy people
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.120]   should look and smell and feel like vomit.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.120]   So that's why he doesn't just describe sin as in rebelling against God or you just missed
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   the mark.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.000]   He goes into the detailed description of what that is.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.600]   So every little part of this, so think about if you were an Israelite and he said, "If
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.080]   you want to have a relationship with me, you got to go through these rituals and they have
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.040]   to kill these animals, you know, and they have to make these sacrifices and you see
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.920]   blood and your hand gets dirty, they sprinkle it everywhere.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.360]   It's like a slaughterhouse."
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.600]   And this is a part of a day-to-day scene in the nation of Israel.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.440]   Do you think that made an impact on people on how they viewed sin?
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.400]   Yeah, it was because it was meant to be illustrated.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.480]   God didn't just want them to hear about sin, he wanted them to see it.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.040]   He wanted them to smell it.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.960]   He wanted them to touch it.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.440]   He wanted them to experience this in every way.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.560]   There's a reason why he kept all the tribes in equal distance from this tent because he
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:06.320]   wanted them to see what it is that you need to be atoned for, right?
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.400]   So God, not only does he take it seriously, he wants his people to take it seriously,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   right?
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.160]   And that's why these details are here because he wants you to know beyond just it's dirty.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.960]   You want me to tell you how dirty it is?
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.240]   There's excrement in there.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   You know what percentage?
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   A huge percentage.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   Rat excrement, human excrement.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   Dog excrement.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.640]   They drop it on the ground with all this hair.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:38.040]   He's describing the filthiness of the sin that requires these sacrifices over and over
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.680]   and over and over again.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.980]   This sin offering in particular is a description of that pollution.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.120]   What it does to them, what it does to the nation of Israel.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.920]   It's not simply a personal affair, but corporate.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:02.040]   The offering also reveals a degree of sin based upon the individual knowledge of the
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.280]   sin and the individual position of standing in the nation of Israel.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:14.600]   So not only is it sin, he says there's different degrees of sin based upon who you are.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.680]   If you're a priest, if you're a leader of Israel, a common person, or if it was a collective
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.960]   sin, God required different sacrifices.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.480]   And if you read it, you would have noticed that based upon your standing in the nation
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:35.040]   of Israel and before God, the sin offering that you needed to give was larger.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.840]   It was a bull offering without blemish, it was a bull, it was a goat without blemish,
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.280]   or a lamb without blemish, a female.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.360]   So there was different degrees of this.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.880]   All of it for what purpose?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.200]   Sin is not all the same sin.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.840]   Some sins are worse than others.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   It doesn't mean that there's some sins that God doesn't mind.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   Any sin needed to be atoned for.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:06.600]   But there's these degrees of sin where it required more.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:18.280]   So again, this particular offering, it helps us to understand sin from God's perspective.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.400]   The ritual of sin offering.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.240]   So there's three parts of this, and before we get into it, I'm just going to give you
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.760]   a brief outline.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:33.040]   The ritual of the sin, it highlights whose sin is atoning for, what animal is going to
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:40.360]   be sacrificed for that purpose, and where the purification needs to take place.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   So these three.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.880]   I didn't put that up there, but those are the three outlined.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:49.560]   Who sin is atoning for, what animal is being sacrificed to atone for their sins, and where
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.440]   the purification needed to take place.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:58.680]   So the first one, this offering is the most detailed as to whose sin is being sanctified
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.560]   for.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:10.320]   The anointed priest most likely is referring to the high priest, not simply any priest.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.480]   And again, there is some discussion on this, but most commentators believe that this is
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.400]   not in reference to just an average priest.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.920]   It's talking about the high priest.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.640]   And that's the reason why he is on the top.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.560]   Even above the whole congregation, he's the number one.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.920]   So if this high priest sins, these are the things.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.000]   And his sin is much more serious, because he's a high priest who was chosen to represent
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.560]   God and the people.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.080]   Ultimately, the high priest was an office that Jesus himself was going to fulfill in
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.680]   the book of Hebrews.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.520]   The second is the whole congregation.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.400]   Third were the leaders of Israel.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   But let me explain briefly, just in case you think the leaders may only refer to just the
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.640]   major leaders, a few of the leaders.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.560]   Anybody who's in any kind of leadership is under this category, whether it's a large
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.240]   group or a small group.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:18.720]   So you could be a leader of your tribe, you could be a leader of a particular family,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.200]   you could be a leader of a small group.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.720]   Anybody who has any kind of leadership where you're representing God to the people and
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:31.320]   people to God, whether you are a priest or you're a deacon or any kind of leadership,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:36.040]   would fall into that kind of category, where people are looking to you for guidance of
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.120]   any kind, that would fall into that category.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.640]   And then the final one would be the common people of Israel.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.600]   It would be a layperson, an individual.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:54.760]   This is the different categories that are listed out for us.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.360]   The type of animals differ based upon who it's being sacrificed for, and obviously in
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:08.720]   decreasing order, you have the bull without blemish for the anointed priest, which would
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.480]   have been the most expensive sacrifice, would have been the bull.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.920]   An average person probably would not even be able to afford this.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.200]   This is something that would require a great deal of money.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.760]   So when a high priest, when he makes, he needs to be, his sins need to be atoned for, they
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.760]   require the greatest of sacrifice.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:37.200]   A bull is also offered for the whole congregation, again, because of the sheer size and number.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.000]   A leader sinned, a male goat without blemish.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.040]   Remember we talked about that before, the male goat was, anything male was considered
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.980]   of more value than the females, at least in the sacrificial system.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.640]   And then the last thing for the common people sin, a female goat or lamb without blemish
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.720]   was also required.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:04.520]   So you can see in almost a decreasing order of value, going from the priest, the congregation,
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:12.480]   to leaders of any kind, and then a lay person.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.780]   And all of this to teach what?
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.460]   Even sin, there's degrees of sin.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:24.200]   Is this taught in the New Testament?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:30.400]   Degrees of sin, is it taught in the New Testament?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:40.440]   Or are all sins the same in the New Testament?
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:54.280]   Okay, all right.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:01.920]   Absolutely, the New Testament does talk about different degrees of sin.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.960]   We'll talk about that at the end, later on.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.000]   So this is not only in the Old Testament.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.080]   The New Testament describes that there are degrees of sin.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.240]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.560]   So this is reflective of how God sees sin.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.280]   God doesn't just see sins as one blanket statement of immorality.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.920]   He's very precise.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:31.360]   If they were poor, he permitted them to bring two turtle doves or two pigeons.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:39.320]   And even if that was too much, he gave an allowance to give a tenth of an effa, basically
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   flour.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:54.760]   So again, like all of these little details, it's God making provision for everybody.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.400]   I remember the first time going through this, thinking to myself, "Why does this holy God
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   even care?"
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:07.640]   I mean, it's one thing for him to go and atone for the sins of sinners.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:14.200]   I mean, you know in the New Testament, he says that he counts the hair on our head?
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.480]   That's basically what he's doing, right?
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.200]   He's not just atoning for sins.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.880]   He's concerned about the poor.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.120]   That if you can't afford this, then bring this.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.480]   And if that's not enough, and if you're financially strapped, and you can't do that.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.080]   So he made provision for the poorest of the poor people to be able to come and atone for
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:36.600]   their sins, so that everyone would be able to have access for him.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.720]   And I remember the first time thinking through this, it's like, "Why does he care?"
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.360]   The fact that he would even care for a king, somebody noble and moral, but just the poorest
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.200]   of the poor person, he's concerned about them?
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.000]   That he would go through this trouble to make provisions?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And then later on, he talks about how the foreigners are traveling through their land,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and they can't eat.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.400]   Make sure you leave the corners of when you harvest, just leave that alone for them to
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   eat.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.000]   I mean, you're talking about, you know when the Bible talks about how God cares for us
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.760]   like a nursing mother, and even if they forget, I will not forget you, right?
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   I mean, his love is so intricate and so detailed, and he's caring for the people that you would
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.240]   never even think about.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   Foreigners are traveling through the land, these Gentiles are going to come defile the
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   land?
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   They're poor people, they can't afford anything?
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.120]   And he said he made provisions for them, right?
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.640]   He's so precise.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.080]   He tells the fat portions were to be burned and was to be a soothing aroma for the Lord,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080]   right?
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:46.200]   So every time these sacrifices are made, this aroma that kind of went throughout the camp,
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   right?
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.360]   This atonement that was taking place because of these sacrifices, they didn't just see
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.720]   it, they smelled it.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.440]   This smell was a sweet aroma, right?
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:08.200]   To God and to the nation of Israel, that God is able to draw near because of this.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.600]   And it says the rest of the animals, including its skin, flesh, head, legs, entrails, and
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:21.240]   dung was taken outside the camp and burned beside the ash sheep.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   Even that, even something that seems like if you just read this without really thinking
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.800]   through and it's like, well, he took these things and he threw it outside in the camp
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.640]   and they just didn't want it.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.120]   You know, if you didn't understand where it was, I think some of you guys already know
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.480]   you know what this ultimately points to because you probably studied it before.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.400]   But if you didn't know that and you were just reading through it, you would think like,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.120]   oh, okay, you know, he, you know, all these details, what does this, any of this mean?
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.800]   But even in that detail, right, it's revealed.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   I'm going to come back to that.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   Okay.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.880]   I got the wrong one up here.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.280]   Turn to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:11.000]   Turn to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.680]   Verses 11 to 13.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:24.560]   Something that seems so, you know, insignificant, but when you understand redemptive history,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.520]   that little statement here where he says take this and burn it outside the camp had significance.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.940]   In verse 11 to 13, it says, "For the blood, for the bodies of those animals whose blood
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.160]   is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   the camp."
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.640]   So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   blood.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.800]   "Therefore, let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured."
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.840]   So even this thing that seems as trivial as just something passing by and it says make
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.560]   sure you, after you do all of this and take all of this and take it outside the camp,
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   it was a foreshadowing of Jesus coming, right?
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.840]   That he was going to be crucified outside the camp.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.560]   He's calling his people to come out and join him outside the camp, right?
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.520]   So nothing, even the things that we may not fully understand, there's meaning behind it.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.980]   We just don't get it, some of it, right?
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.760]   And this is the reason why I encourage you to look at the details.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.120]   All of these details have meaning.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.000]   We may not be Bible scholars to be able to catch everything, but what little that you
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   catch is amazing, right?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.160]   That there's nothing that he said that's wasted.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.800]   That even in that, it was pointing and preparing for Christ.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.960]   We're going to come back to the tabernacle.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.160]   The sprinkling of the blood was different based upon who they were cleansing.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.400]   So he would say to take the blood and to sprinkle it in different places based upon the different
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.160]   degree, right?
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.560]   He said the anointed priest and the whole congregation, the priest will take some blood
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.880]   of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.400]   And then the second part of where it says the priest shall dip his finger in the blood
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.960]   and sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the Lord in from the veil of the sanctuary.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:18.040]   Sorry if that's too small.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.600]   Sprinkling the blood with the holy place indicates that the pollution caused by the priest or
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.480]   the whole congregation was more serious than a layman's sin because he didn't require this
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.040]   of the leader and the congregation.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.920]   He only required this where they need to go in, sprinkle the veil.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.520]   I'm going to come back to this.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.040]   So remember the tabernacle?
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:47.080]   Remember the tent of meeting?
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.640]   So that's basically the outline.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.120]   You have a picture of this is what a tabernacle would look like.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.160]   And it's not that big, right?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.840]   It may stretch from maybe one side of our building to the X and maybe from this stage
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   back there.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.960]   It's a huge, huge structure.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.520]   But in the middle of that, so this is kind of like what you would see from the top and
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.000]   this is the outline.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.960]   So if you look at it, you see, you can't see it now.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   Okay.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.420]   Anyway, you see where the arc, can you see the arc?
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.040]   You see that box within the box, the rectangle?
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.400]   And within that rectangle, there's a outside squiggle line and inside squiggle line.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.160]   The inside squiggle line is the veil that he's talking about.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.400]   And that inside squiggle line divides between the Holy of Holies and the Holy place.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.360]   So the Holy of Holies is where the arc of the covenant is, right?
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.560]   And that was where the mercy seat was.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.960]   And it was supposed to be a symbolic presence of God's throne seated on that seat.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:58.320]   And so only on the day of atonement, once a year, the high priest comes into the Holy
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.520]   of Holies, only once a year.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.460]   And then he drenches the place in blood.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.540]   And so it was meant to atone for sins, right?
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:12.880]   So this particular sin, if it was a sin from the high priest or the congregation as a whole,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.160]   that veil inside had to be cleansed.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.920]   And this was only required of if it was the high priest or the congregation.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.320]   Meaning that their sin was more significant.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.160]   It had a bigger impact on the presence of God in the nation of Israel than if a lay
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:38.040]   person did it, right?
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.000]   So again, all of this to point to God's preciseness over sin.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.960]   The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.120]   And then a leader of Israel and the common people, the priest shall take some of the
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.520]   blood, sin offering, and they'll put it on the altar of burnt offering.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.080]   Where's the burnt offering altar?
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.640]   It's on the outside, right?
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.440]   It's not within that second rectangle.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.320]   It's on the outside.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.040]   So their sins also needed to be atoned for, but it wasn't as serious because they didn't
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.160]   have to go in and sprinkle the veil.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.520]   And that veil was what?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.760]   What happened with that veil when Jesus was crucified?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   It was torn in half.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.760]   And what did that symbolize?
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   Access to God was open, right?
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.600]   So the sprinkling of the blood on that veil basically meant that the presence of God,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.840]   where people would enter even once a year, had to be cleansed.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.320]   Their sin tainted access to God.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.920]   Do you understand?
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:42.960]   Their sins was more significant because their sins tainted access to God.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.880]   So that veil had to be sprinkled with blood to be purified, right?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.640]   So sin is sin.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.480]   Sin still needed to be atoned for, but again, all of this is to kind of reveal to us how
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.360]   God views sin.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.480]   And the remaining blood for all the different sacrifices were poured out at the foot of
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.320]   the altar of burnt offering, right?
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.640]   And then Hebrews 13, 11, 13, "The bodies of the animals whose blood has brought into the
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.640]   holy places."
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   Yeah, I already read this.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:16.120]   I put it in the wrong place.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   Every thing that God called for this offering to be made.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.920]   And this is the part that is mentioned over and over again, right?
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:32.000]   Inadvertent sin or unintentional sin.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.800]   So this is not like you can go and sin willfully and come before God and just make some sacrifices
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.400]   and you're good, right?
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.880]   That's not what the atonement was for.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.920]   And if we're not careful, we can see our sins that way.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.000]   We just, "Oh, we just commit sin because God is so gracious and loving.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.680]   I just come and repent.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.920]   God forgive me of my sins and then I'm free," right?
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Because God's so merciful.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   We just don't see the weight of the sin because we don't understand how God views sin.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.440]   And so we hear this blanket statement, "God is so loving.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   He's so patient.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.840]   He's, you know, he's unconditional.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.840]   There's nothing you can do for God to love you any more than he already does."
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.120]   And so you hear these cliches.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.160]   And then so you have this vague understanding of sin.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.800]   And so a lot of people commit sin not understanding the consequences of this and how the Bible
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.280]   describes this sin and thinking that, "Well, if I said the right things, you know, I just
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.640]   and I feel it right here, then we're good.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   Being God is good."
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.360]   I want you to understand, like, this is the reason why this book of Leviticus is so important
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.320]   because it reveals God's heart and how he sees sins.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:51.640]   He specifically mentions five separate times here and it's six separate times in this that
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:58.200]   it is for unintentional sin, right?
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   Unintentional sin.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.320]   I know some of you guys are thinking, "A lot of my sins are intentional," right?
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:10.520]   How many of you have not sinned ever intentionally?
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:19.360]   Does that mean that any sin that you sinned, knowing that it was sin, there is no forgiveness?
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.680]   I hope you ask yourself that question.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.120]   Because this is crucial.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.920]   Isn't it?
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.560]   It's crucial.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   If you read this, it's like, "Oh, it's for unintentional sin."
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.320]   And you just moved on.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.560]   You didn't really understand the gospel.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   You didn't understand God.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.000]   You didn't understand forgiveness, but you just moved on.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.920]   And that's very dangerous.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.040]   You can live your whole life not understanding who God is and what he has done and how our
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.320]   sins are atoned for, why it's atoned for, what he accomplished in his atonement, if
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.760]   we don't carefully ask these questions.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.440]   You can live all your life not knowing Christ, assuming you know Christ, because you never
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.440]   asked.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.960]   You just assumed because you went to church, right?
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.760]   So I keep saying the same thing over and over again because it's true.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.600]   Because it's true.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.400]   Because there's a lot of people born and raised in the church who serve, give, sacrifice,
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:32.480]   go to missions, and are not Christians all the time.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.160]   So, again, these are questions that we need to ask.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.720]   If he says these are sins for inadvertent sin, unintentional sin, what does he mean
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.280]   by unintentional sin?
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.000]   The repeated phrase "unintentional sins" means not that sinners were ignorant of the
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.440]   law, but that they were ignorant of having violated the law.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:03.920]   If ignorance of the law was not an excuse, if we define sin as a violation of known law,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.640]   the more ignorant you are of the law, the God-dear you would be.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.680]   True?
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:18.000]   If somebody wanted to say, "We're only guilty of the things that we know of."
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.320]   And then when it gets revealed to us, then we're guilty.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.080]   That's what it seems to say.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:31.920]   So let's stay ignorant.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.760]   Obviously that's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.280]   If you apply that in a wrong way, you would completely get a false gospel.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.680]   Can you imagine that being applied to the gospel today?
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:48.400]   How would that be applied if you understood that wrongly?
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.440]   As long as you stay ignorant, you're innocent.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   That's one.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.000]   "I didn't know.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.680]   Are these people starving?
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   I didn't know.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.080]   Oh, that's sin?
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.320]   God didn't want me to do that?
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.320]   I didn't know."
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.520]   As long as you stay ignorant, you're innocent.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.720]   This blows that out of the water because we're going to look into that.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.040]   Another way that this could falsely be applied is people who've never heard the gospel.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.120]   They're ignorant.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.440]   They didn't know.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   Right?
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:24.520]   If they didn't know, they should be innocent because they were never exposed to it.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:30.160]   Again, my encouragement to you to really study the details because the details revealed to
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.080]   us, it's a shadow.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.800]   The reality is explained in the New Testament, but these kind of point to that to help us
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   to see.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   Right?
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.120]   Again, you know, I have a few verses just to kind of highlight.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.680]   It says, "For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   to them.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.320]   For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.120]   perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made, so they
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.920]   are without excuse."
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   Right?
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:05.480]   He said there is nobody who is absolutely ignorant because God made it plain to them.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.800]   There's no innocent person because of ignorance.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   Right?
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.520]   We are ignorant because we choose to be ignorant.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.720]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   Right?
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.760]   They suppress the truth because they delight in the darkness rather than the light.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:23.200]   Again, Psalm 139, 23-24, this man's repentance is, "Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.960]   Try me and know my thoughts, and see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.360]   the way everlasting."
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.200]   He's asking God, "Are there sins that I'm unaware of?
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.480]   Are there unintentional, ignorant sins?"
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.560]   And yet God calls them sin.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.920]   Right?
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.520]   Even when it is unintentional, even when it is ignorant, sin, there is a subjective aspect
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:49.040]   of sin, there is a objective aspect of sin.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.000]   Right?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.400]   Sin is not just when you feel dirty.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.240]   Sin is whatever God says is sin.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   Right?
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.360]   I want you to really, like, let that sink in.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:12.760]   There is a subjective aspect of sin where your knowledge made that sin more sinful.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.400]   But there is an objective aspect of sin where anything that violates who he is and anything
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.800]   that violates his law, whether you did it intentionally, unintentionally, is still
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.680]   sin.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.160]   And this is what this sin offering covers.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:32.440]   Did you understand that?
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.160]   We typically think that sin is only sin if it is of our heart.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.280]   Right?
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.160]   When our heart is engaged, obviously, it makes it more serious.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.920]   But let's go dig a bit further.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:55.400]   Number 15, 28 through 31, it contrasts between unintentional sin and then intentional sin.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.160]   And the intentional sin, they call it high hand.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.640]   I think I have the verse here.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.520]   I'm going to have to come back to all of this.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:13.440]   So Numbers 15, 28 through 31, he makes a distinction between intentional and unintentional.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   And he describes it high hand.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.520]   It says, "And the priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the person who makes a
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.560]   mistake when he sins unintentionally, to make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.920]   You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.400]   the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.680]   But the person who does anything with high hand," and that means it was willful, it was
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.280]   deliberate, "whether he is native or a sojourner reviles the Lord, and that person shall be
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.420]   cut off from among his people.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.600]   Because he has despised the word of the Lord and has broken his commandment, that person
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.360]   shall be utterly cut off, his iniquity shall be on him."
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.280]   So he makes a distinction between an unintentional sin where it was not premeditated, it was
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.960]   not calculated, and he may have been even ignorant of it, and then when that becomes
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.240]   known to him, then he repents and he comes and gives a sacrifice.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.080]   But he said a man who commits a high hand sin, meaning it was intentional, calculated
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.840]   sin, that there is no forgiveness.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:22.920]   Hope that makes you nervous, because we're not done.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:31.920]   You should be asking, if you stop here, you should be asking, "Oh no, we're all in trouble."
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:40.960]   I don't know if this is the, oh no, this is not the verse we want to get to.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.840]   The sinner who sins with high hand intentionally will not be forgiven, cut off.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.920]   And so an example that he gives us in Numbers 15, 32-35 is a man who breaks the Sabbath
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.360]   and gathering sticks.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:03.400]   How many of you knew that breaking the Sabbath was a capital punishment?
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.760]   You knew, some of you guys are tired.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.440]   A lot of you guys knew, right?
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.360]   Breaking the Sabbath was a capital punishment.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:17.640]   And this comes right after when he says, "Unintentional sins are forgiven, intentional sin won't be
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.760]   forgiven and he shall be cut off."
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.400]   And cut off meaning that he's going to, there's capital punishment, right?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.360]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:32.880]   And so the first example that he gives, to give an example of a high hand sin, is breaking
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   of the Sabbath.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.680]   Why do you think the breaking of the Sabbath was considered a high hand sin?
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.640]   You don't have to answer.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.880]   I want you to think these things through, right?
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.480]   Because from our perspective, it doesn't seem that big of a deal, right?
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.680]   It doesn't, I mean, he's breaking it, he didn't kill anybody.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.160]   By the way, intentional murder comes up next, right?
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.400]   Premeditated murder.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:12.120]   So premeditated murder, breaking the Sabbath, has equal punishment.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.560]   Why would these two sins have equal punishment?
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.040]   Clearly premeditated murder deserves capital punishment.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.720]   Breaking of the Sabbath.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.020]   So we have to understand what he means by high hand then, right?
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.640]   What he means by intentional.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.880]   The reason why the breaking of the Sabbath and premeditated murder, he didn't say killing,
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.040]   he said premeditate, it was intentional.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:44.240]   Breaking of the Sabbath where he said over and over and over again, the significance
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.680]   of the Sabbath, right?
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:58.600]   Sin is not, the gravity of sin isn't what it does to us.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:05.160]   The gravity of sin increases based upon what it does to him.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.760]   True or not?
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.880]   If you murdered an adult, it would be a grievous sin.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:17.700]   If you murdered many children, it would be much more grievous, right?
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:25.120]   So even within us, we have different degrees of what we would consider to be heinous.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.920]   So if there are degrees of heinousness, the greatest of sin is the one that directly offends
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.400]   God.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.920]   Not us, but him.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.680]   Breaking of the Sabbath was a willful rebellion against God.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.560]   It was not a mistake.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.200]   Nobody else is out there doing it.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.760]   You are willfully choosing.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.400]   I'm not going to obey you.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.120]   It was not a mistake, right?
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:46:05.360]   Now I want you to understand in the context of what sin caused the fall of mankind.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.420]   Eating a fruit, right?
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.800]   Eating a fruit that God told them not to eat was what brought the condemnation of mankind
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.160]   where sin reigned, death and reign.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.800]   All mankind died because they ate the fruit.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:28.200]   If you take that and then you apply it here, it's like eating a fruit.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.560]   How we understand sin is from our perspective.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.840]   It's from our perspective.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.160]   So I hear people say foolish, foolish things.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.360]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:50.040]   As if sin is determined by a fallen heart that the Bible tells us not to trust because
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.280]   it is corrupt.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   And to determine whether a sin is heinous or not, or it is acceptable or not, based
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:04.640]   upon if it bothers me or doesn't bother me, in and of itself is supreme arrogance.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:11.520]   It's supreme arrogance because the core of human rebellion is to say, "I'm at the center.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.360]   God serves me."
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.640]   We may never articulate that, but that statement of describing sin as with me at the center
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:25.320]   and other human beings is at the core of human rebellion.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.160]   That's not how God sees sin, and that's not how sin is.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.040]   Sin is from his perspective.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:36.080]   So a heinous sin is a sin that looks to God and says, "No."
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:43.280]   Whether it's eating of a fruit, whether it is gathering sticks or premeditated murder,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.960]   is when you look at God and say, "No."
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.200]   I'm going to determine what is right.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.080]   I'm going to determine what is wrong.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:02.120]   So these details matter because it reveals to us what sin is.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.200]   And until we recognize what sin is, there is no repentance.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.120]   Because if you look at it, "So it doesn't bother me."
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.240]   If it doesn't bother you, you don't need to repent.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   You can't repent.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.640]   How can you repent of something that you're not sorrowful about?
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.680]   How can you repent of something you do not see?
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:21.440]   There's a reason why when David repents, remember what he says?
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.600]   Who did he sin against?
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.240]   "You, and you alone have I sinned."
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.880]   To God.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.680]   We look at that and say, "He sinned against Bathsheba.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.040]   He sinned against her husband."
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.400]   How can he possibly say?
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:41.640]   It seems unfair and unrighteous for him to say, "To you and you alone have I sinned."
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.840]   Because we look at it from our perspective, because he wronged people.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:54.120]   We're more offended by what he did to another human being than what he did to God.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.080]   Because of our skewed, sinful perspective of how we view sin.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.960]   That's not how God views sin.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.640]   That's not how it ought to be viewed.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:17.880]   So this offering, it gives the basis of us understanding what he came to atone for and
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.280]   what the atonement did.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   It's very precise.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.240]   The defiant sin is done willfully and without repentance.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.640]   It is a willful rejection of the Lord, Lord God, and his law.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.680]   So it's not simply that, "Oh, you didn't know and all of a sudden it came to knowledge."
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.360]   It was a willful rebellion.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:45.760]   And so when you recognize that you sinned and you become aware of it, God gives a provision
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.080]   for repentance.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.560]   But it leads to true repentance.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.920]   The defiant sin is done willfully without repentance.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.480]   It is settled rejection of the Lord, God, and his law.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.400]   The unintentional sin, when brought to knowledge, causes a deep sorrow in the believer's heart.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:06.440]   It is followed by true repentance.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.360]   And that's the passage, Hebrews 10, 26-29.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.520]   "For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving knowledge of the truth, there no
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.200]   longer remains a sacrifice for sin."
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.240]   Once it has been revealed and you refuse to repent, there is no other way of salvation.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.640]   Basically you're rejecting Christ's atonement because you're refusing to repent.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:31.400]   "But a fearful expectation of judgment, a fury of fire that will consume the adversary."
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.680]   And here, before I even read that, here's a problem that we have in our generation where
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:42.520]   we want our repentance to be taken seriously when we really haven't repented.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.480]   Let me say that again.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:55.520]   We are bothered when people question our repentance when oftentimes we really never repented.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.360]   We have no intention to turn away from our sin.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.600]   We just want forgiveness.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.640]   There's a willful rebellion happening in our heart.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:11.920]   And because we said, "Forgive us," you should take it seriously.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   There's a reason why there's a distinction.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:19.520]   True repentance is when you recognize that there's a rebellion in my heart against God
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.320]   saying, "I'm going to do this my way.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.520]   I refuse to obey you."
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.760]   That's intentional.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.480]   That's willful.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.760]   Unintentional sin is you're trying to conquer it.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.240]   There is sorrow in our hearts.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:38.680]   We have every intention to flee from this sin.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:44.320]   And so you come before God and there is provision made for us, but an intentional willful sin
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.000]   where there is no changing of heart, there is no changing of life, he says there is no
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   repentance because that's not real repentance.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.280]   "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy and the evidence of two
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.520]   or three witnesses.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.440]   How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the one who has spurned the
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:03.480]   Son of God and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he has sanctified and has
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:09.360]   outraged the spirit of grace?"
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:16.120]   Is this concept of free grace, right?
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:20.160]   We're saved by grace alone.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:29.240]   So therefore don't make me feel guilty is absolute heresy and is not new.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.840]   If any of you struggle with that, it is not new.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:37.720]   It has always existed in the church because the primary work of the devil is to pervert
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:46.600]   the gospel because if you pervert the gospel, you pervert entrance into the throne of grace.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.760]   This is not bringing community church.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.640]   This is scripture.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.140]   And this is not just in Hebrews.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:57.760]   This is how God revealed himself, the nation of Israel.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.720]   There is atonement for true repentance.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:07.440]   There is no atonement for fake repentance.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.800]   The specific sins that would require the sacrifice are fourfold, at least mentioned in chapter
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   five.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:22.480]   If anyone sins in that he hears a public adoration, meaning a specific thing that they need to
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.800]   testify against and they do not do so, he says that is a sin.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.040]   If anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass or unclean wild animal or carcass
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:37.440]   of unclean livestock or carcass of unclean swarming things, that is a sin.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.680]   If he touches human uncleanness of whatever sort of uncleanness, maybe with which one
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.080]   becomes unclean, that is also sin.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:53.400]   And this is the reason why Peter was so afraid to touch the unclean animals.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   We didn't get there yet.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.840]   He's going to give a description of what makes a man unclean, what animals are unclean, what
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.840]   fish are unclean.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.080]   So he tells them you can't touch any of that.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   So we're going to get into that later.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.760]   So I'm not going to get too deep into it today.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.680]   But he says whatever God says is unclean is unclean.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.800]   If you touch that, you become unclean.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   And then when you become unclean, your access to God becomes unclean, needs to be purified.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.560]   And if you happen to be a priest, high priest, if you happen to be a congregation, then the
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.960]   very access to God gets tainted.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.620]   That's exactly what happens.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:31.040]   If a pastor or the leaders, if we live in sin, whether you think or not, God sees it
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:37.420]   because you've taken on that position, there is a greater weightiness of that position
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.080]   because it taints their access to God.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:49.760]   So it is a tremendous, tremendous sin for somebody who represents God in any capacity,
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:55.240]   especially from the pulpit, to misrepresent God.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:55:00.960]   And I always think about Moses at the end of his life where he's just sick and tired
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   of their complaining.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.880]   He didn't even want this job to begin with.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.600]   And he's like there sometimes he's pleading on their behalf, "Lord, how can you send us
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   without your presence?
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.680]   You know, everybody's going to be laughing at us.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.480]   You know, we would be unprotected."
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.560]   And so he pleads on God's behalf for mercy.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.520]   And then at the end of his life, he's just had it.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.640]   There's like more water, more.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.840]   And then he's like, and God says, "Give him the water."
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.560]   Like he's so patient.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.560]   Just give him the water.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.880]   He comes and he's like, "Here's your darn water."
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.600]   I'm not exactly sure what he did, but later on God says he's punished because he didn't
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.000]   present God as holy.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.880]   He didn't represent God accurately.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.000]   And as a result of that, he doesn't get into the promised land.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   So it was a great sin.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.320]   And Moses wanted so much to see the promised land.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.600]   And he pleads with God, "Look at that beautiful land.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.840]   Look at all that land that you promised."
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   And he says, "Enough.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   I don't want to hear it."
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:01.960]   And then he banishes him because it was such a great sin for him to misrepresent God.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:08.320]   All of this is embedded into this particular offering.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:14.160]   Anyone who makes a rash oath, either to do evil or to good, if you made a vow and you
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:22.440]   don't fulfill it, he said it was also considered sin.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:28.360]   And let me rush through the last part.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:36.360]   Not everyone, clearly the scripture says, should presume to be a teacher.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:40.240]   That servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.380]   will will receive a severe beating.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:46.360]   But the one who did not know and did what deserved the beating will receive a light
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.360]   beating.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.920]   Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:57.160]   And from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand more.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:03.040]   By the nature of who we are, the fact that you are here studying the book of Leviticus,
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   this is not something that majority of the people around the world have access to.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.760]   They don't.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:16.560]   You have pastors in India, all they were given was the Bible and some of them just the New
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.560]   Testament.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.920]   Some of them can't read.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   And they're taking the literal knowledge that they have and they're risking their lives
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.260]   and the health of their families to go and spread the gospel.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:31.120]   You and I, the fact that you are at a church where the Bible is being taught, you have
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   access to the internet, you have fellowship with your brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.720]   you are able to come to a building where your children are taken care of, and you have enough
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:44.720]   money to be able to live that you're not sacrificing your family or your job or your comfort to
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.760]   be at church and yet to be fed week after week after week after week.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:54.600]   All of these things are responsibilities that God has given us.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.960]   Because you have more knowledge, more access, more freedom, more encouragement.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.640]   Every once in a while I hear somebody say, "I can't grow because I don't have enough."
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.700]   Enough of what?
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.880]   What is it that you do not have enough of that you're going to come before God and say,
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.680]   "I couldn't grow."
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:21.600]   In light of where you are, how can we possibly, how can we possibly with a straight face come
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.960]   before God and say, "I didn't have enough."
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.240]   Whatever it is that you think.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   Right?
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.640]   James 3, 1, "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.200]   who teach will be judged with greater strictness."
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:43.400]   This is the reason why we don't actively say we're raising up leaders.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:47.200]   Now obviously there are people who will lead, there are people we ask to lead.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.800]   We don't ask, we don't deliberately say we're raising up leaders.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.160]   Because the Bible says not many of you should presume to be leaders.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.200]   Because there's stricter judgment that's coming upon you.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:02.880]   So when we appoint leaders, we're not doing them any favor.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.800]   Because the scripture says that the weight of their sin is much greater if we're taking
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.800]   on that task.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:11.760]   So it's better not to be a leader.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:19.200]   So to covet leadership in any capacity is to not to know the weight of what it means
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.840]   to be a leader.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.000]   Because that's what the scripture says.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.440]   So what we try to do in the church, we're trying to raise up servants.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.280]   People who will serve, sacrificially serve, people who will mimic who Christ is.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:38.600]   And in that, if you are leading in serving, you will become a leader.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.360]   I hope that makes sense.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.000]   We're not raising leaders, we don't see leadership as somebody who's articulate and who has a
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.760]   lot of knowledge and who's charismatic.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.320]   That's not how we see leadership.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.280]   Because that's formula for danger.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.680]   We see leadership as people, first and foremost, who are humble, who's willing to serve and
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.800]   sacrifice.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.440]   And if they are leading in serving, then they could also lead.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:10.160]   Again, all because the scripture designed leadership that way.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   There's a reason why the last thing Jesus did before he went was to get on his knees.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:21.200]   Because he knows that our natural human nature is not to serve, but to be served.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.360]   So he's telling his apostles, "I'm going to send you out to preach the gospel, but don't
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.500]   forget this.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.000]   Get on your knees and serve."
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.400]   And that's probably the greatest advice that I remember from my father going into ministry.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.320]   He said, "Don't forget, you are Tom."
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   That's what he said.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.440]   That's what he said to me.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   You are Tom.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:50.040]   So if they treat you like Tom, it's because you signed up for it.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.160]   That's the greatest advice he gave me.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.960]   And that's a man who was in ministry for 40, 50 years.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:03.520]   He said that to me, one, because it's biblical, second, because that's what he experienced.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.640]   The leadership is not something that we covet.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:13.000]   If you covet that, it's because you don't know how God views this.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.400]   Sin affects more than just us.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.780]   It affects the community.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.920]   So whenever God puts us together, we're a body of Christ.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.640]   If one sins, it doesn't just affect us.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.000]   It affects everybody.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.360]   If your finger hurts, it's not just isolated, your whole body hurts.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.960]   1 Corinthians 3.16, the "you" in this passage is plural.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960]   It's talking to the church.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.680]   "Do you not know that you are God's temple?
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.960]   God's spirit dwells in you.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.120]   If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.360]   For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple."
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:47.120]   And the reason why Paul is able to say that, because the Jew would have understood this,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.320]   and he would have immediately seen this picture in Leviticus chapter 4 and 5.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.600]   Because when they sin, it was embedded in them that there was a defilement in the tabernacle.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   It wasn't just them.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   Their sin affected the whole community.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.440]   That's what Paul is referring to here.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.240]   Again, two more passages, then we'll wrap up for today.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   Hebrews 9.12-14.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.520]   Again, these passages, again, point to this sacrifice.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.240]   "He entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.280]   but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.480]   For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls, and with ashes
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.760]   of hyphor sanctifies for the purification of the flesh," clearly this isn't pointing
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.760]   to this sacrifice.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.760]   "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:43.600]   without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.120]   So the book of Hebrews is the bridge from the Old Testament to the New.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.520]   It's saying Christ fulfilled this sacrifice.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.760]   Hebrews 10.19-22.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.080]   "Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.960]   by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.680]   flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with true
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.960]   heart full of assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience,
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.080]   and our bodies washed with pure water."
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.640]   Clearly, again, this is in reference to this sacrifice.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.560]   Sprinkling for the purpose of cleansing.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   Right?
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.920]   And so all of this, all the details that are mentioned here, it helps us to understand
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.320]   this, like what Christ has done.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.400]   Every single one of this, kind of like Jesus is crucified, it's almost like every one of
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.120]   these things are different spotlights.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.800]   The Leviticus is kind of pointing to the bottom.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.360]   The gospel points at the center.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.900]   The epistles point from the top.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:47.600]   And so every aspect of it is a different spotlight on the cross.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.440]   And the more you dig into it, you see different glimpses of what is that we've seen from a
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.960]   distance but we get to see it displayed, his glory displayed through the book of Leviticus,
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.720]   through Hebrews, through every one of these sacrifices.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.920]   All for the purpose of what?
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.520]   To destroy our pride.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.120]   Destroy our rebellion.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.880]   That we would come in awe of who he is and what he has done.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:25.440]   So that we may worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.800]   The discussion questions is, again, is applicational.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.160]   In what ways does a private sin affect the whole church?
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.560]   Does knowing that others are struggling with the same sins help you to be more bold in
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.880]   fighting the sin or does it cause you to be more relaxed in accepting sin?
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.840]   What causes either to happen and how should we strive for the former and not the latter?
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:51.800]   And this is a constant struggle in discipling the church where we don't want to get to a
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.440]   point where everybody's living in fear and afraid to be honest with their sins and then
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.400]   we don't want to get to the other point where people are so honest that sin doesn't seem
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]   like sin anymore.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.840]   Where it's just acceptable, we're just a bunch of people who keep sinning and we're okay
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.920]   because God loves us.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.840]   How do we balance these two things?
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.280]   Where we take holiness seriously but at the same time we understand we're sinners in need
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.960]   of the grace of God.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.640]   Where we don't compromise grace or holiness.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.720]   Third, why is it important to confess our sins to one another?
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.560]   James 5.16 says, "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.040]   you may be healed."
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.160]   The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:38.840]   So one of the tools that we are given is the body of Christ to pursue Christ together.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.000]   There's not a single individual who can say, "I don't need these people."
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.400]   That's again, that's human pride.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.280]   That is also sin.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:51.000]   And so the scripture says that in our struggle against sin that he gave us the body of Christ
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.560]   to confess.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   And so one of the things that I'm asking you to do today in Bible study or in your small
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.840]   group to as you're discussing that you would end the small group with honest confession.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.400]   Now don't make things up.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.800]   Don't say, "I need something to confess."
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.960]   So don't try to say something that's actually not there.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:16.880]   But I know that there's enough of us that if we're honest that there's a lot of things
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.200]   that you've been sweeping under the rug.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   You've been just kind of sweeping under the rug and you just kind of like generically
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.680]   is covering with the blood of Christ.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.200]   Thank God he's merciful.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.840]   Maybe you're struggling with pornography.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.360]   Maybe you're making some compromises at work.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.640]   Maybe you're getting physical with your girlfriend or somebody that you shouldn't be.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.840]   Whatever it is, you know it's wrong, but the way that you've been dealing with it is you
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.320]   just been kind of sweeping under the rug and you've been asking for forgiveness, but you
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:56.040]   really weren't coming to God and seeking to flee.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:03.520]   And so I'm encouraging you this evening when you come to your groups to be honest, right?
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.320]   And if there has been anything willful in your heart saying like, "I'm just going to
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.440]   deal with this on my own."
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.640]   And you haven't really confessed that before God.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.480]   You didn't really repent.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.560]   You just kind of swept it under the rug saying like, "Oh, since God is merciful," and you
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.640]   just kind of skimmed over it.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:32.480]   If that's been the case, come before our group and be honest and openly confess because we're
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.840]   all in the same boat.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.400]   And we don't want to normalize sin.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:44.080]   We don't want to say sin is okay, but at the same time, pursuit of holiness can't be an
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080]   option.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.400]   It can't be enough.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   We want to be used for noble purposes.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.400]   If we want to do that, he says to get rid of the ignoble, right?
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.800]   Let's do this together, right?
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.160]   So I'm going to pray for us and I'm going to dismiss you to your groups and take some
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.560]   time to discuss these things.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:09.000]   And I'm going to pray that the Lord will lead you to fruitful discussion.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Let's pray.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:33.080]   Lord, the more we look at ourself and our inner being, could you have loved us?
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.120]   Why didn't you turn away?
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   What is man?
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.320]   Who are we?
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:48.240]   That you would go through all this drama for us.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.680]   Why would you send your son?
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:59.400]   Lord, we don't understand.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.120]   We don't understand.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.360]   Help us.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:13.600]   Help us to recognize what it is that we have in you so that our lives would truly be a
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.240]   reasonable response, a logical response of worship to you.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.960]   That we would live in celebration, in joy, in thankfulness.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.560]   That as you loved us, that we would love.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:35.200]   Lord, I pray this evening that you would help us to be open.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:42.560]   That we would hate sin more than our pride, more than our reputation.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.520]   That we would desire you, Father God.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.720]   And I pray for honest discussion, open confession.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:10:00.840]   That we would not give the devil even an inch to cause us to hide, to live in shame and
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.440]   guilt.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:08.480]   Knowing Father God that we have your son's blood to atone for our sin.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.960]   Help us Lord God not to hide, but to come forth that we may be free and to be free in
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.960]   you.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   Help us this evening.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:18.960]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:18.960]   Amen.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.500]   All right.
