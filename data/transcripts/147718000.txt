[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760]   So we pray that your spirit of revelation and illumination would lead and guide us in
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.880]   Okay, welcome back from Thanksgiving.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.200]   I know we already had one Sunday but a lot of you guys were gone for Thanksgiving.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.040]   Today we're looking at Isaiah chapter 5 and verse 6.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.200]   How many of you who have asked me for electronic copy didn't get one?
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.640]   Email me for electronic copy.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960]   If you didn't, email me because for whatever reason you have not been added, otherwise
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.680]   I've been emailing the electronic copies.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.480]   Alright so let's, you should have gotten two pages, one is with the notes and the other
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.920]   one is for the next week's assignment.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.520]   So you should have gotten two of them.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.480]   Alright so let's begin.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.720]   So we're looking at chapter 5 and chapter 6.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.560]   Chapter 5 continues God's case against Israel and again that's what we've been looking at
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.080]   starting from chapter 1.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.440]   Chapter 1 all the way to what we're studying now.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.520]   Chapter 1 kind of lays the foundation.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.040]   Chapter 2 begins an indictment.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.000]   This is the reason why the judgment is coming.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.360]   Chapter 5 is a continuation of that.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.240]   In more detail, 1 through 4 details how God did everything like a farmer.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   So if you look at verses 1 through 4 it says, "Let me sing for you my beloved, my love song
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   concerning his vineyard.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680]   My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill."
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.840]   So I ask you to go look at verse 7.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640]   Basically he's saying that the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.400]   So God's using the imagery of the farm and again to indict the nation of Israel.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.520]   So what he says is he did everything that a good farmer would do and would expect a
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   good harvest.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.980]   There wasn't anything lacking in the nation of Israel.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.000]   So in other words, all the things that he's laid out, all the sins that they committed,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.660]   all the compromises, that none of this is because God lacked something.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.280]   He gave them everything that they needed for them to bear fruit.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.360]   He says first of all it was very fertile.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.520]   He dug it and cleared it, he said first of all my beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   hill.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.840]   He goes down the list of what he did.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.240]   He cleared the stones.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.720]   Now it doesn't say that clearing the stone means that he got rid of the enemies.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.440]   These are just kind of my added notes on top of that.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.040]   How did he cultivate the nation of Israel?
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.320]   He didn't just say hey go out and do your best.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.640]   He said that he planted them in the most fertile place.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520]   He cleared the stones.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   I kind of take that as all the enemies, all the obstacles that would prevent them from
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.440]   being successful, whatever it may be, he already came out and cleared it.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.480]   That's exactly what God does, right?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.720]   When they come into the Canaanite land, they don't do the fighting.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   God does, it's kind of like God cleared a stone for him to plant the seeds.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.880]   He plants choice vines.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.840]   Again the nation of Israel were not just like any other nation.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.560]   God gave them the law for them to follow and he said as long as you abide by my law, don't
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.840]   turn from it to the left or the right, you're going to bear fruit.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.320]   You're going to bear fruit, just don't turn from the left to the right.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   He built a watchtower.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.120]   Watchtower basically after you plant something so that the animals won't come and take it.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.600]   We take that again, he sent prophets and leaders just to watch over them.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.040]   He hewed out wine vat and looked for it and expected it to bear fruit.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.120]   So again the image he's using is a good farmer who lays out every foundation that is necessary
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.160]   for it to bear fruit.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.420]   He picks the most fertile ground, he clears out the stone, clears out all the enemies,
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.560]   he plants choice vines, gives them the law, he sends prophets to watch over them, the
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   leaders to take care of them, and then he says he kind of waited, built the wine vat
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.600]   waiting for the fruit to come and basically in other words what he's saying is everything
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.080]   that they needed to bear fruit but didn't.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.440]   So no one can say that the reason why we didn't obey you is because it was too hard.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.080]   The reason why we compromised is because we lacked this.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.000]   He said no, the indictment that you are guilty of, you had everything, you had more than
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.760]   what other people can ask for.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.920]   This is kind of related to what we talked about on Sunday, Romans 3, it says what benefit
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   is there being a Jew?
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.520]   It's like much in every way, how can you possibly even ask that?
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.720]   But above all the blessings that you have, on top of that you were given the laws of
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.880]   God, the word of God.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   Turn your Bibles with me to 2 Peter 1, 3-5, and whoever gets there first, if you didn't
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.360]   just read it out loud.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   2 Peter 1, 3-5.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   Whoever's there first, can you just read it out loud?
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.960]   "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness through
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.200]   the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.840]   granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.160]   partakers in the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   of sinful desire."
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   There?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   No?
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   Yeah, okay, up to there.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160]   So basically what he's saying in 2 Peter is the same thing that God is saying here.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.640]   He's telling the nation of Israel that everything that you need you already have.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   And again, I think it's important for us to take a minute to kind of reflect on, you know,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.360]   when we think about how we are, how much of our weakness and the reason why we wallow
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.640]   in our situation is because, you know, because of this.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.080]   And whatever "because" we use, in the presence of God he says, "No, I've given you everything
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   that you need."
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.440]   So anytime we come before God and say, "I'm this way because," right?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.200]   That's like the nation of Israel saying, "Well, of course we don't obey you because we don't
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.440]   have this.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.560]   We don't have the kings.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.360]   We don't have the money, the circumstances, the religious, whatever."
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   Right?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.920]   So again, the reason why he's doing this is so that when the judgment comes, that there's
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.000]   not a single person that can stand under this judgment and say, "Hey, this is not fair."
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Right?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.800]   So what he's establishing here is the fairness of the judgment that's coming.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   So he's kind of breaking down every argument that an individual can stand and say or as
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.160]   a nation can say, "No, we are the way we are because..." and he said, "No."
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.040]   One by one, just argument, just knocking it down.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.560]   Right?
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.520]   And so he says as a result of that, verse 5 and 6, what is his judgment?
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.760]   "I will remove its hedge, it shall be devoured, I will break down its wall and it shall be
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.840]   trampled down.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   I will make it a waste, it shall not be pruned or hoed and briars and thorns shall grow up.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.240]   I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon you."
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   Basically, what is he saying?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   Right?
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.760]   So what does this sound like in the New Testament?
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.960]   Do I have it up there?
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.920]   It's actually right there.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.720]   Okay?
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.680]   This sounds exactly like what Paul says in Romans chapter 1.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.760]   They kept on going to sin, they refused to acknowledge God, so what does he say?
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.920]   He hands them over to their own passions.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   Right?
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.280]   So, in other words, he says the final judgment is, "I've given you every possibility to come
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   to me."
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   Right?
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.880]   "I've given you everything that you could have possibly needed."
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.680]   In fact, no other nation can claim this.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.960]   Right?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.680]   The Canaanites could not have claimed this, the Assyrians and the Babylonians, they can't
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   claim this.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.280]   God didn't favour them.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   Right?
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.480]   If anybody had an excuse, they could have given an excuse, but Israel cannot have an
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.840]   excuse before God, considering what God gave them.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   Right?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.040]   So as a result of that, he says, "Well, that's what you want?
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.360]   I'm going to withdraw my blessing."
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.280]   So the final judgment is, instead of protecting them, you're going to be like everybody else.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   Right?
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.320]   You're going to be like any other small nation, without my protection.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   Remember I showed you that map of Israel?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.240]   And what would it, remember, just kind of use your imagination.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.480]   Israel's here, what's up here?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.600]   Assyria's here, behind that is Persia, eventually they're going to become the superpower, and
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.560]   Babylonians are right here.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.760]   Right now they're not that big, they're like right here, and Assyria is like right here,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.200]   and the Persians are kind of looming large over here.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   What's down here?
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   Egypt.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   Egypt.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Right?
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   So these are mega nations, these are superpowers.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Israel's like right there.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   A tiny little nation.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   Right?
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.960]   So the southern kingdom is a little dot over here, the northern kingdom is a little dot
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   over here.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.720]   So the only reason why they're even significant, why we're even talking about them, is because
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.840]   God was with them.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.040]   Otherwise, we probably have to go through history, like what's so magnificent about
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.760]   Israel, other than their religion, that we would be talking about them 3,000 years later?
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.840]   Right?
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.480]   Only reason why is because God was with them.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.440]   So in other words, what God was saying is, you as a tiny little nation, if I withdraw
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.200]   myself, all of these things that he's saying is going to happen, it's just going to happen.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.400]   Because that's what happened to every other nation.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.320]   Assyrians came up and they bullied everybody else, and then eventually the next bully came,
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.760]   the Babylonians, and they bullied everybody else, and then the Persians came and Persians
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.080]   bullied them, and then the Greeks came and the Greeks bullied them, and then the Romans
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.960]   came and the Romans bullied them.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   Right?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.280]   So all they were was a tiny little speck of a nation, and so God's judgment is, I'm no
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   longer going to protect you.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.320]   And then you keep running toward these other gods, and you see what these gods will do
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.080]   for you.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.320]   And so ultimately he says that's the final judgment.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.120]   He lays out six different reasons, they all kind of overlap, but each one of them, if
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.280]   you remember as you were going through, there's six different woes that are mentioned in chapter
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   five.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.840]   Eight through ten is an indictment on greed.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.360]   He said, "Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.840]   more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land."
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.400]   In other words, you may be successful in getting all these houses, but in the end, what's the
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   judgment?
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   No descendants.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.680]   There's nobody to live in them.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.400]   You're going to have all this stuff, but you have nobody to give it to.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:03.560]   Eleven through seventeen is a long list of indictments about self-indulgence.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.240]   So one is greed, this is how their idolatry was expressed, through possessions, through
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.560]   greed, "Woe to those who arise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink."
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.480]   And basically he's talking about an individual who's just seeking pleasure, self-indulgence.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.880]   What can I do to gratify myself today?
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.320]   "They have lyre and harp, tambourines and flute and wine at their feasts, but they do
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.480]   not regard the deeds of the Lord or see the work of his hand."
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:39.160]   In other words, it's not that God is saying, "Hey, you shouldn't be seeking pleasure."
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.080]   He said, "In the context of seeking pleasure, you forgot who God is."
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.600]   That in the end, ultimately, God ought to be your treasure.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.480]   "Therefore, she who has enlarged his appetite and opened his mouth beyond his measure is
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.240]   the nobility of Jerusalem, and her multitude will go down her, revelers and who exalt in
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   her."
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.600]   In other words, he's saying God's going to humble those people who are seeking self-indulgence.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.800]   18-19, indulgence or indictment against self-delusion.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.880]   So let's look at verse 18 and 19.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.440]   So the picture here in verse 18 is, "Woe to those who draw iniquity from cords of falsehood,
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.240]   who draw sin as with cards of rope."
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.040]   What does that mean?
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.120]   What does that mean?
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:40.040]   What is the imagery of verse 18?
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.520]   What is the indictment against them about sin?
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.400]   When you think of what he's saying here, I want to encourage you, if you read a verse
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.360]   that you're not familiar with, go to the message Bible or go to the contemporary Bible.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.640]   Now, I'm not saying that that's the right translation, but basically it's the quickest
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.760]   way for you to figure out, "Oh, that's what he meant."
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.640]   Again, I wouldn't tell you to use that as your final resource, but if you're not studying
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.520]   through a commentary, you just kind of want to like, "Oh, what is he saying?
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   This imagery is kind of strange."
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:24.760]   Go to the message, what are some, living Bible, what are some other Bibles?
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   Contemporary translation?
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.920]   Yeah, so anyway, those translations are basically commentaries.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:37.740]   They've taken anything that's difficult, they translate it so that it would make more sense
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.740]   in English.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.940]   So, if you look at that verse, what is the imagery?
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.700]   He's pulling the cart, cart full of sin, right?
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.700]   What is that imagery?
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.740]   What is he saying?
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.540]   Wherever he goes, he's dragging his sin with him, right?
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.140]   He's got a cart load of sin.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.580]   Wherever he goes, he's dragging it around with him, right?
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.780]   It's not just compartmentalized in one place, wherever he goes, right?
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.700]   Just like the scripture says, you know, when not to lay hands hastily, it says, "Some men's
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.500]   sins are obvious, some men's sins trail behind them, but they can't escape from their sin.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   Eventually it will be revealed."
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.180]   And so, that's the imagery that we see in 18.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:27.420]   And then he qualifies that even further, he'll say, "Let him be quick, let him speed his
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.020]   work that we may see it.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.540]   Let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and let it come that we may know
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.540]   it."
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.540]   How many of you read that and say, "What?"
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.540]   How many of you read that and just put a question mark?
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.540]   What does he mean by that?
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.540]   Anybody want to give a crack?
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.540]   Okay, you're just saying like you were one of those people, yeah.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:53.780]   It could be, right?
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.380]   How many of you guys thought it that way?
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.380]   That he's saying, "Oh, let God come."
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.380]   No, I think, I read commentaries, that was one of the options.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:19.620]   So, imagine, remember what he says about the nation of Israel in chapter 1?
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.260]   Well, remember in the beginning they're deluded and then at the second part of chapter 1,
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.260]   what does he address?
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.260]   False religion.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.980]   Like, they're going and giving many sacrifices and he says, "What do they mean to me?"
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.260]   So, they were deluded.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.900]   They thought that they were right with God.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.740]   So, they're completely oblivious.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.380]   In fact, the next verse says it, right?
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.980]   He says, "They call good evil and evil good."
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.380]   So, their sense of right and wrong is completely perverted, right?
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.380]   So, even their own assessment was wrong.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.700]   Not only were they dragging sin, I mean, he says, "The imagery is everywhere they go,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.580]   they're dragging this cart full of sin and even though they're filled with sin, they're
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.620]   standing before God saying, 'Hey, God, come.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.740]   Do your work.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.660]   We want to see you,'" right?
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.980]   Not realizing when God comes, judgment is coming with him.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.980]   That's how deluded they are.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.540]   Verse 20, "Indictment against perversion of truth."
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:20.420]   Again, we read that in verse 20, "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil."
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.340]   That's how deluded they are.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.980]   Think about our culture, right?
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:33.340]   Things that was clearly universally Christian or non-Christian was considered sinful 30
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.340]   years ago.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.100]   Now, it's like sinful to call it sin now, right?
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:43.580]   So, he's again, indicting these people that when God gives you over to your sin, you're
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.580]   going to start justifying your sin.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.940]   Remember, I said this so many times, whenever there's guilt on someone's life, either you're
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.940]   going to deal with that guilt somehow, that guilt is going to lead you to repentance.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.260]   Because the only way to get rid of guilt is by repentance.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.540]   God can forgive you of your sin and you get rid of that guilt through repentance.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.460]   Or you're going to somehow justify the guilt.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:14.020]   Either you're going to nullify it and you're going to say, "Well, everybody else does it."
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020]   Where do you draw the line?
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.340]   And then you start using that language, all of a sudden you're justifying.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.100]   We look at the scripture and we're so far away from what the scripture says and we're
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.580]   not going to change, so therefore, maybe the way we understand it is wrong.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.140]   Maybe my theology is wrong, right?
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.180]   And so, that's basically what they're doing.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.900]   They're so deep in their sin and they're unwilling to repent and now they're going to call sin
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.900]   good and good sin.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.700]   Again, the fifth one is indictment against pride.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.060]   Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and shrewd in their own sight.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:54.740]   So, all of these things together, they're just completely deluded.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.260]   And then finally, in 22-23, indictment against their vain pride and social injustice.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.500]   Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, the things that they boast about, completely
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.500]   frivolous.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:14.140]   Think about, you know, think how detailed that he's getting about their sin, right?
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.020]   Think about the kind of things that we boast about, completely frivolous before.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.300]   It made me say, "Ah, you know, I don't drink, so I don't qualify for that."
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.860]   But think about a lot of things that we kind of look at as, "Wow, look at that."
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.380]   You know, pride or I'm not going to get into details.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.700]   I don't want to offend anybody, you know?
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.900]   But think about how frivolous a lot of things that we get excited about and we boast about,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.500]   how frivolous that must have been before God, right?
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.420]   And so, he's saying the same thing.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:46.020]   You know, these guys are so deluded in their sins, they don't recognize it.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.460]   They're asking for God to come, "Oh, we want to see your glory," not realizing that judgment
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.900]   is coming with God, right?
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.660]   They don't even know how to discern what is right and wrong because they've drifted so
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.820]   far away.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.700]   Even in their own eyes, like saying, "Okay, you know, I'm better than them."
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.700]   Why would these people think they're better?
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:13.020]   Well, because they're religious, right?
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.300]   And they're probably comparing with the pagans.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:22.340]   They're comparing, "Yes, we worship idols, but we don't sacrifice our children, right?
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.340]   We're not cannibals.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.260]   We don't go to temples and have orgies," right?
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.500]   So in their eyes, they're comparing with the rest of the world and the debauchery that's
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.220]   out there and say, "Well, we're better than them."
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.300]   So in their eyes, they don't deserve judgment because they're not comparing themselves with
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.340]   God's law.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.060]   If they looked at the law carefully, they would see how far they are, but they're comparing
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.660]   themselves with other people, right?
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.420]   So again, he's laying out, again, all of these things are God's indictment against Israel.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:59.340]   So when the judgment comes, and you know exactly, here's, you know, before you give a sentence
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.180]   to somebody, the judgment's saying, "Here, you're guilty of this," and they'll read you
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.660]   what you did, right?
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.660]   And that's basically what God is doing.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:13.600]   Therefore, as a result of the rebellion against God, he will bring judgment, and that specific
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.920]   judgment that he says in verse 26 to 30 is that there's going to be a foreign nation
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.200]   that's going to come, and we've been talking about that, right?
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.480]   So he says he's going to take away the hedge, his protection, and as soon as he withdraws
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.000]   himself, what's going to happen?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.440]   The bullies are going to come, right?
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.840]   And so that's the description he has from 26 to 30.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.080]   He says he will raise a signal for nations far away, right?
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.800]   Those are the, most likely the Assyrians and the Babylonians, and whistle for them from
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   the ends of the earth.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.480]   Behold, quickly, speedily, they come.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.960]   So all this, verse 27 to 30, is not a description of Israel.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.680]   This is a description of the foreign armies that are coming, right?
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   They're going to come with judgment.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.720]   None is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a waistband is loose, not a
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.920]   sandal strap's broken.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.560]   So if you don't read this in context, you're going to think like, oh, Israel's pretty,
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.320]   you know, what's wrong with them?
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   They sound pretty good.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.560]   He's not describing Israel.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   He's describing people who are coming to destroy them, right?
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.640]   It's kind of like, you know, like maybe the church is weakened, and when the church is
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.240]   weak, the devil is strong, right?
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.480]   So again, when I was a young Christian, I used to, you know, live in fear of the devil,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.120]   because it was in a charismatic circle, and they always talked about demons.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:42.480]   And as I was maturing as a Christian, I realized demonic strength is only as strong as I am
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.680]   strong in God, right?
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.400]   Because the Christ in me is much greater, but when the Christ in me is weak, not because
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.800]   Christ is weak, but because I'm greedy in the Holy Spirit, then the demon is going to
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.000]   be very strong, right?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.320]   We have no power over demonic force when we are not in right with God.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.080]   And there is demonic force.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.040]   That's absolute guarantee.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.440]   As much as we pray to God, as much as we believe in heaven, there's a hell.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.320]   As much as we believe in angels, there are demons.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.800]   The scripture tells us over and over again, right?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.360]   So when we are weak, the enemy is very strong.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.440]   So he's describing the enemy coming to destroy them.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440]   So chapter six.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.600]   I think chapter six is probably the easiest to understand of all the chapters until we
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   get to chapter 53, right?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.960]   It's like, "Oh, I get this," because you probably heard many messages on this.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.920]   But one of the first questions I asked was, "Why is this in chapter six?"
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   Right?
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.440]   That was one of the questions I asked, right?
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.200]   Why is the calling of Isaiah in chapter six?
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.440]   What do you think, what do you naturally would think the calling of Isaiah would be?
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.640]   Chapter one, you would think he would begin with, he called, right?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:09.280]   It starts by saying he ministered or he prophesied during the period of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.640]   and then Hezekiah.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.160]   So here he says Uzziah dies and then Isaiah comes into ministry.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.800]   So you would think he would begin with that, but he's in chapter six.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.880]   So again, I think I mentioned this in the beginning of the introduction.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   Isaiah is written thematically.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.280]   It is not written chronologically.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.160]   So that's one of the reasons.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.720]   The whole book of Isaiah is not written chronologically.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:39.040]   So one, Isaiah is not about ministry of Isaiah.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.120]   Whole book of Isaiah is not, "Here's Isaiah, this is what he did, this is what he said."
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   It's not about Isaiah.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   Isaiah is just a mouthpiece.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.840]   Secondly, Isaiah is just one of many prophets.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.920]   All these prophets here, they're all called pre-exilic prophets, meaning before they went
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.600]   to exile, before the Assyrians and the Babylonians came, God sent all these prophets, so one,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.680]   two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine prophets.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.560]   And all of them had similar messages, right?
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   Because you didn't obey God.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.840]   So every one of them has their own little insights, right?
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.760]   Isaiah probably being the greatest of all of these prophets, but Isaiah was one of all
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.800]   of these prophets that God sent out, right?
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:32.240]   Again, Isaiah's calling is in the context of God's bigger story of judgment and restoration.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   So it doesn't necessarily need to be chronological because that's not his point.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.640]   His calling, just to kind of give you a background behind his calling so you understand what's
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.520]   going on, his calling begins at the end of Isaiah's reign.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.880]   Was Isaiah a good king or a bad king?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.960]   He was a good king.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   Was he good all the way?
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.760]   It doesn't say specifically.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.440]   High places.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:13.000]   Remember when we talked about what are high places?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.120]   Most likely it was idol worship that he, it says he did what was right in the eyes of
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   the Lord, except he didn't remove the high places.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:26.600]   So it was true of Uzziah and it was also true of Jotham and then remember Ahaz?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.560]   Yeah, he did what was wrong in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   He was evil all the way through.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   How about Hezekiah?
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   Hezekiah is actually good all the way.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.560]   There's nothing bad said about Hezekiah.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:48.720]   He's one of, one of probably one or two that actually stands out in Israel's history as
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   being the good king, right?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.040]   And his mistake, if we can call it a mistake, was he begged God to live longer and as a
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.760]   result of that Manasseh comes.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.600]   Manasseh is actually the worst king, one of the worst kings Israel has.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.640]   He reigns, Uzziah reigns second longest.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.400]   He reigned for 52 years.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.960]   Only one other person reigned longer than him was Manasseh, was 55 years, right?
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.360]   Which was one of the most evil kings, Manasseh.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   He reigned the longest.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:26.400]   But there's kind of an asterisk to his reign because even though Uzziah reigned 52 years,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.840]   he didn't remove the high places and as a result of that, it says in 2 Kings 15.4 and
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.640]   on, that as a result of that he was struck with leprosy.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.480]   And so he had to be stationed in his home and it doesn't say specifically how many years,
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:50.400]   but his son Jotham, as soon as he was able, ruled in his stead until he died.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.520]   So one thing I want to just kind of take a minute to talk about here is, Uzziah is one
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.400]   of the better kings of Israel and he reigns for a long period of time, but God still punishes
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   him for his sin.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.880]   He doesn't just say, "You know what, you're good, I'll weigh the bad stuff, I just kind
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.880]   of cover over the bad stuff."
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.880]   He doesn't say that, right?
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.560]   He said he was a good king for the most part, he tried to do what was right, but he didn't
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.160]   obey completely.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.360]   So there is no sin in the presence of God where God says, "You know what, I weighed
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.920]   the good and the bad and there's so much good in you that the sin that you have just kind
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.760]   of covers over."
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.320]   Every sin is detestable in the eyes of God and we see that, a perfect example of it is
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   in Uzziah's life.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:36.720]   Here's a king who did what was right, but he didn't fully surrender to God, right?
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.160]   And it's at the end of his life, right?
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.920]   So for the most part, I mean, consider all the bad kings in the northern kingdom, consider
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.040]   out of all the bad kings there's only about eight of them and out of eight of the good
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.720]   kings, only one or two of them is like Hezekiah.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:58.040]   So if you think about it, in Israel's history, this was, was it a good time or a bad time?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:04.320]   Considering everything else, this was actually one of the better periods in Israel's history.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.920]   So think about when God is sending Isaiah to bring judgment upon Israel.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.480]   He's not just a maneseh, it wasn't just when they were barring their children and, you
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.960]   know, it wasn't just that.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.520]   It was during a period when they were worshiping God.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.920]   There was a lot of temple worship, there was a lot of religiosity, but in the context,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.440]   they weren't fully surrendered to God.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.320]   And that's what kind of, he said, "You know what, all the things that he's saying, he's
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.280]   not talking to people that you completely ignored him, you know, you never gave worship,
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   you didn't even care, he doesn't say that.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.360]   He says, "You're doing all these religious things thinking that somehow by these religious
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.040]   things it's going to cover over the other sins that you're committing."
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.960]   And basically what God is saying through Isaiah is like, "No, right?
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:59.480]   Sin has to be atoned for and so the judgment is coming because of the sin that you're allowing."
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.360]   So, in the Old Testament, it's about the, his son reigned in his place because of this
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.360]   disease.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.680]   And so the picture you have, this is probably, you've probably heard many sermons on this.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:16.200]   In chapter 6, it begins with a scene where he sees the seraphims, angelic creatures.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.600]   The two wings cover their feet.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:23.800]   In the Old Testament, the reason why you cover your feet is because you're in a holy ground,
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   right?
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.320]   Where is a situation where somebody had to cover their feet or take off their shoes because
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   they were in a holy ground?
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.840]   Moses at the burning bush, right?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.160]   Two wings cover their face to protect themselves from God's glory.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.240]   Again with Moses, when he's receiving the law and says, "Let me see you," he says, "If
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   you see me, you will die."
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:53.400]   So, even these holy creatures in the presence of God has to cover themselves, right?
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.240]   So his glory was terrifying, right?
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.400]   So if it's terrifying to these angelic angels who doesn't have sin, right?
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   They're not corrupt.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   They didn't fall.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.720]   These aren't fallen angels.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.040]   These are angels without sin.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.000]   And they're in the presence of a holy God and they're covering their feet and covering
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   their eyes.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.120]   So what would happen to a man who is sinful, who actually has sin, right?
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.520]   And that's the scene that we see with Isaiah.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.640]   Isaiah, again, with two, they're flying around.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.920]   And if you look at the Old Testament imagery, remember when the priest went into the Holy
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.440]   of Holies, right, the sacred room?
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   One of the main things is that they could not stay there.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.540]   They had to do their work and they had to get out because that was where the presence
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.240]   of God was.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:47.640]   So no one, only the rightful owner of the mercy seat, who is that?
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.120]   Whose seat is that?
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.680]   Jesus' seat, right?
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.160]   When Christ comes, he will be the rightful owner of that seat.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.040]   And until then, he said these high priests would come, they'd do their work, sprinkle
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.840]   the blood and they'd have to get out.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.480]   So that's the kind of imagery that we see at the throne.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.760]   These holy creatures are hiding their feet, hiding their face and they're moving around
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   constantly.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.080]   And what was their main thing that they're saying?
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.120]   They're worshipping him in his presence.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   That's their constant presence.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.580]   They're worshipping, they're serving him, right?
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:27.040]   So again, as I said, if these holy creatures can't even look at God, they have to cover
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.640]   their feet, they're flying around, holy, holy, holy, right, in the presence of his
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.920]   glory, what would be the response of a sinful man?
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.680]   And Isaiah, in comparison to the rest of Israel, is holy.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.920]   But in comparison to God, he's sinful.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:47.480]   So the first response, Isaiah recognizes his sin, right?
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.200]   And so where does he recognize his sin?
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   He says, "And the foundations of the threshold," verse four, "shook at the voice of him who
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.640]   called, and the house was filled with smoke."
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   So when God spoke.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.760]   So he was watching this scene from a distance and he sees these creatures and he's seeing,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   but when does the fear come to Isaiah?
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   When God speaks, right?
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.680]   When he speaks, the earth moves and you feel the smoke.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.960]   And I said, "Woe is me, for I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.080]   the midst of people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts."
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.520]   So it's when he speaks and he sees his glory, he's terrified, right?
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.320]   His recognition of sin goes beyond just his own sin.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.400]   Like, "I'm a man of unclean lips and I am from people of unclean lips."
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.800]   Who are the people he's referring to?
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   Israel, right?
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:46.760]   So he's going to be a prophet who's going to be sent, right, to represent him to this
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.560]   unclean people and that's the first thing that he recognizes.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:57.440]   Before he becomes a prophet of God to be sent, he needs to recognize who he's talking to.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.880]   He needs to know who he is and he needs to know who he's talking to.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.280]   And both, he says, "I'm a sinner, talk to the sinners."
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   Right?
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.240]   And that's what he recognized first and foremost.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.200]   So again, any representative of God is representing a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.440]   And his primary work is to reconcile that sinner to himself.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.520]   So if the man who's preaching doesn't recognize his sin or he doesn't recognize the primary
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.040]   problem of the people he's preaching to is sin, then he can't properly represent God.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.160]   Because anything he gives to those people, whether sin is not atoned for, is absolutely
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   useless.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   Right?
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   So that's the first thing he sees.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.760]   He's in the presence of his glory, he recognizes his, he's terrified.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.000]   I think, those of you guys read the book Holiness of God, I think the way that R.C.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.400]   Sproul explains it, the word "woe" is undone.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.400]   Right?
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   Undone.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.400]   In other words, I'm dead.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   Right?
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.400]   That's the term.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   Woe is me, woe is me.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.400]   I am dead.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.240]   How can I possibly be in his presence and live?
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.640]   If these holy creatures can't look upon the glory of God, right?
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.160]   If Moses can only see the glimpse of him going, how can I possibly be in his presence and
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.640]   have seen and heard his voice and live?
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.360]   And so he's like, woe is me, woe is me.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.720]   I am done.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   Right?
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.000]   Which he would have been if God didn't do what happens after that.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.280]   So what happens?
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:30.760]   He takes a call and he atones for his sin.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.560]   Without that atonement, he would have died.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.560]   Just like any one of us.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:40.040]   Going to think that we're going to be in the presence of this God and we're going to live.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.640]   Only by the atonement of God.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   So the work, so he calls him, he prepares him.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.120]   You know, who's going to go for me?
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.920]   He says, here am I, send me.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.040]   And then here's the crazy part.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.640]   He says, well, you're going to go for me?
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.560]   And they said, keep on hearing, but do not understand.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.200]   Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.960]   Make the heart of this people dull and their ears heavy and blind their eyes.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.640]   Let's say, see with their eyes, hear with their ears and understand with their hearts
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.920]   and turn and be healed.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.440]   And he goes on and says, you know, how long do you want me to do this?
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.400]   I mean, that's a question that anybody would ask.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.080]   I'm surprised he didn't change his mind.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   I hear my, send me Lord.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.160]   I was like, okay, now I'm going to go for me.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   You're going to preach to these people.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   They're not going to listen.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   They're going to harden their hearts.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   They're going to be blind.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.080]   You know, like, okay, how long?
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.400]   Until the judgment is complete.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.320]   Until everything, everything that I said is going to happen, happens.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   You stay to it.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:49.680]   Why, why would God send a prophet if the end conclusion of it is judgment?
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.680]   Is justified in his judgment?
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   Yes.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:58.880]   Like what you talked about in the beginning of like, there's no, you know, this is kind
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.680]   of, you know, it'll, it'll bleed over to the text that we're going to be looking at in
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:10.720]   Romans, in chapter three, where God's glory, when we think of God being glorified, how
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   do we normally talk about it?
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:20.000]   When we say, oh God, so glorify Jesus, glorify Jesus, what do we normally talk about?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.440]   His mercy, his kindness, grace, compassion.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.920]   That's what we normally think about.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:35.960]   But do we, have you ever thought about glorifying God in his wrath, in his judgment, in his
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:42.120]   condemnation, that God is glorified even in hell?
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.720]   Because what does glorify mean?
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.040]   To magnify, right?
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.560]   To take something and then put it on a pedestal and shine light on it.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.160]   That's what glorify means, right?
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:03.000]   So when Jesus is, Jesus on the cross glorifies the Father, does he just glorify his mercy
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and love?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.600]   No, his wrath, his judgment, his justice, his holiness, all of that is magnified on
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.680]   the cross.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.600]   All of that together is magnified, right?
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.040]   So the fact that God says if you sin, judgment is coming, when God carries out his justice,
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.760]   that is also glory to God.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.640]   So ministry is not simply, again this is something that I really had to come to terms
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:33.360]   with years back when I was wrestling with ministry, that ministry is not simply declaring
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.120]   his mercy and only seeing people fall in love with his mercy.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.000]   It's falling in love with God himself.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.640]   Falling in love with his mercy and his holiness.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.000]   If somebody is attracted to his mercy and yet is not attracted to his holiness, that's
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.280]   not God.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.160]   You can't separate those two things.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.360]   That's why somebody who says I'm in love with Christ because he's so compassionate and loving
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.920]   and merciful but holiness is something that he's done.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.640]   The reason why Christians desire sanctification is because there's an attraction to his holiness
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.280]   as well.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.240]   There's a desire to be like him.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.000]   He's glorified in every way, in his holiness and his justice.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.520]   So it's not just, I'm sending you to them because I want you to magnify my mercy and
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.800]   his holiness and his holiness is doing great but he says I'm going to send you to them.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.880]   These people aren't going to listen.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.800]   He's not taking innocent people and then hardening their heart.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.080]   What is he doing?
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.880]   In fact I think there's a passage.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   Turn your Bible, we talked about this earlier, to chapter 2.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   Remember what we said about here?
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:50.280]   Look at verse 10.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.480]   Talking about his mercy and justice.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.240]   Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from before the terror of the Lord and from the
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.960]   splendor of his majesty.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.720]   How is his majesty described?
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.480]   So terror of the Lord and the splendor of the majesty is the same thing.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.600]   How many times has he mentioned that?
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   Verse 19.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   And the people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground from before
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.000]   the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of his majesty when he rises to terrify the
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   earth.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.040]   So he says his terror is described as splendor of his majesty.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.960]   Again in verse 21.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.000]   To enter the caverns of the rocks and the cliffs of the cliffs from before the terror
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.920]   of the Lord and from the splendor of his majesty when he rises to terrify the earth.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:49.560]   So his terror and his splendor of majesty is described as the same thing.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.880]   So God's glorification is not just one side, the things that we want.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.480]   God's glorification is his whole being.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:07.160]   So even in his judgment against Israel, he sends his prophets to declare his glory.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.480]   Think about the contrast.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.320]   Jonah's ministry was only about 30, 40 years before this happens where Isaiah does the
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   ministry.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   Remember what happens in Jonah?
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.280]   He says to the nation of Israel, I'm going to send you to them and they're going to harden
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   their hearts.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   They're going to be blind.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   They're not going to listen.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.200]   They're going to be hard of hearing and they're not going to repent.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.840]   How long do I do this?
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.880]   Until the judgment comes and it actually gets carried out.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.720]   So compare this to Nineveh.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:45.960]   This pagan nation, mutilating people, hated by the nations and yet this reluctant prophet
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.840]   warns them about the judgment of God.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.700]   What happens with them?
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.320]   This pagan nation repents.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.920]   God repents.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.320]   Even this pagan nation, even the one that Jonah says, no, they deserve all the judgment,
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.800]   but when they repent, God forgives them.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:13.680]   This happens, again, his ministry was, so right here, 793 to 753 BC.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   Remember Isaiah's ministry?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   Remember the dates?
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:23.880]   Yeah, so it's about 30, 40, 50 years possibly removed from this.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:31.280]   So it's only one generation prior to Isaiah where this pagan nation was willing to repent
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.680]   but he says, but my people, right?
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.520]   Even though they have all the advantage I gave them, they become so hardened that they
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.080]   won't repent when a prophet comes.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.640]   In fact, God did it.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.440]   God sent one reluctant prophet to Nineveh.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   He sent 10.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.360]   He sent 10 of them pleading with the nation of Israel to repent and they wouldn't repent.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.560]   They could not recognize their sin, right?
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.120]   And the false prophets would come and say, God's not angry with you.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Why would he be angry with you?
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   You're God's people.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.120]   Look at all the sacrifices you've given.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.320]   Look at this beautiful temple.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.040]   Why would God be angry with you?
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.920]   So again, all of this is to stack up evidence against the nation of Israel.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.640]   The judgment is coming and there's nobody who's going to stand before God saying this
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.600]   is not fair.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:24.240]   The bad news to the nation of Israel at the end of chapter 6, he says, the judgment's
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.480]   going to be so complete and though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.760]   So even after the judgment comes, only a tenth remain, right?
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:39.320]   A tenth of all of Israel, only then will remain, but even the tenth is going to be burnt up.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.520]   It's going to be thorough and complete, like a terabith or on an oak whose stump remains
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.520]   when it is felled.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.440]   So in other words, the bad news is that the judgment's going to be so thorough, there's
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.240]   nothing going to be left but a stump.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:43:02.840]   But the good news is that stump that's going to remain is a holy seed, Jesus.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.920]   And the only reason why the nation of Israel has any hope is because he leaves a stump
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   of Jesus.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:17.120]   The only reason why 3,000 years later, this tiny little nation could have been squashed
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.280]   and we never would have heard of, like Israel, what is Israel?
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.080]   You know, you'd have to go back and take history lessons or be a history major to even know
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   who they were.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.960]   And the only reason why we are still talking about them today, why they even have significance
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:36.800]   in modern history is because God's presence was with them, right?
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   Why they didn't disappear.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.960]   Think about a tiny little nation with all those superpowers.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.840]   They're not like way over here, they're surrounded by them, right?
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.720]   They're surrounded by Egyptians, the Persians, the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Romans,
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.920]   the Greeks, they're surrounded by these superpowers that are fighting each other and just a bomb
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.200]   going astray in modern illustration.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.880]   One of these bombs that they're bombing with just went astray and hit them by accident,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   they would have been gone.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.440]   That's how tiny this nation was, right?
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.840]   But in God's redemptive history, they're superpowers.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:19.960]   And the only reason why is because he left a stump, a remnant of the nation of Israel.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:26.520]   Now I'm not going to go off tangent here, but to me, when we talk about God's faithfulness,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.240]   and I know there's a whole different theology saying that Israel has been replaced by the
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.640]   church, I don't believe that.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   I believe that God has a place of nation of Israel.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.960]   The fact that they still exist today is a testament to the promises that he has that
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.800]   meant much of what he's saying to them is still future.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.120]   We're going to see that restored in the second coming.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.400]   But again, all of this, right now he's going to reintroduce the stump which is Jesus and
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.840]   then you know where the prophecy is going in chapter seven, about that he's going to
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.360]   leave a sign, the virgin's going to have a child, and then he's going to go into more
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.480]   of the Messianic prophecies.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.680]   And so he says, "Here's the indictment, the judgment is going to be thorough, there's
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.280]   not a single person who can stand before God and be justified, and you would have been
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:20.040]   completely wiped out if it wasn't for the fact that I made a covenant that the offspring
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.800]   of the woman's going to come and crush the head of the serpent, and we're not done with
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   this yet."
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.320]   He's coming, right?
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.040]   And then so he begins to introduce the hope that's in Christ.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.960]   As he is prophesying about the judgment, the hope in Christ is going to be slowly starting
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   to creep into his prophecies.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.960]   All right, that's it.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:42.800]   Okay, so if you guys can take some time with your small group to discuss.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
