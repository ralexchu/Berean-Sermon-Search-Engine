[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600]   And today we have an anonymous question in the inbox.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   Here it is, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.700]   Pastor John, I've heard you say that while you were working on your doctoral dissertation
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.880]   about Jesus' command to love your enemies, you read a lot of scholars who argued against
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.600]   being motivated to love by the promise of reward.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.760]   And you said that this is simply unbiblical, that Jesus and the apostles motivate love
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.780]   all the time by encouraging us to pursue our own greater happiness.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.240]   My question is, how then can that be love?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.360]   How is this not just using other people for our own selfish ends?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.920]   Didn't Paul say, "Love seeks not its own" in 1 Corinthians 13, verse 5?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.680]   Pastor John, what would you say to these questions?
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.400]   I think that this is one of the most important questions that can be asked in the Christian
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.600]   life.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.340]   We really need to settle it, whether we're going to feel guilty for being motivated by
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.260]   the promises of joy in God's presence that he offers us as a motivation for sacrifice
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.800]   in this world.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.020]   This is absolutely huge.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:27.400]   The Bible is full of commands to love people at cost to ourselves.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   We are often called to make great sacrifices in this world, even risking our lives or intentionally
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000]   laying them down for others.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.880]   If the Bible offers us motivations and incentives to do this by promising that there will be
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.280]   great reward because of it, and we think it's ethically inferior to be motivated that way,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.920]   then we're going to turn away from the very strength that God offers us in the cause of
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   love.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920]   So that's serious.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   We're not dabbling on the edge of things here.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   We're talking about the very center of motivation for Christian living.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   Jesus said, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.000]   brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors, lest they should invite you in return and
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.160]   you be repaid.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.840]   But when you give a feast, invite the poor and the crippled and the lame and the blind,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.240]   and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you."
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.160]   And then he adds this, "For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just."
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.200]   That's Luke 14, 12 to 14.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.220]   Jesus didn't add that last promise for nothing.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.520]   It begins with the word "for," because you will be blessed in making sacrifices in this
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   world to love others because you'll be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   He intends for that to be a motivation, an incentive, a strengthening.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.800]   We're not seeking payback here on the earth.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.980]   That's the whole point.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.800]   It's costly to love others.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   It's thankless many times to love others.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.520]   The payback is later, at the resurrection of the just.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.720]   And yes, I did continually run into this kind of thing when I was working on my dissertation.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.880]   I read scholar after scholar who said the opposite.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   I'll give you one concrete example.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   I won't name him.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.920]   I'll just give you the exact quote, and it's in his commentary on Luke 14 that I just read,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.400]   and he says this, "The promise of reward for this kind of life is there as a fact.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.240]   You don't live this way for the sake of the reward.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.000]   If you do that, you're not living in the new way, but the old selfish way."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.760]   Now, I believe that is simply wrong, and not only wrong, but damaging, damaging to the
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.120]   cause of love.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.520]   Jesus gave that promise of reward at the resurrection, reward at the resurrection of the just precisely
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.000]   to motivate us.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.880]   If that scholar were right, we would have to work to keep the promise out of our minds
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.920]   so that it wouldn't contaminate our motivation.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.220]   But Jesus tells us to do just the opposite.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.120]   In Acts 20.35, Paul is talking to the elders, and he quotes Jesus.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   One of the few places where Jesus is quoted outside the Gospels, in Acts 20.35, he says
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:00.160]   this, "We must help the weak, remembering"—now, that's the word I'm fastening on, not forgetting—"remembering
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.920]   Now, that scholar would say, "No, no, no, no.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.140]   You shouldn't be constantly remembering that as you try to do good to people.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.140]   Remember that.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.520]   It's more blessed, it's more blessed.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.600]   You should forget that.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.660]   Keep that out of your mind because, yes, it's true, but it's going to contaminate your motivation
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.080]   if you keep remembering it."
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.440]   So I'm going to go with Jesus here and not that scholar.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.360]   Jesus emphasizes, "Keep it in your mind.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.240]   Remember, remember, it is more blessed to give than to receive.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.920]   Keep the blessing in mind."
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:46.600]   And then he said in Luke 6.35, "Love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.800]   in return, and your reward will be great."
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.680]   So in other words, just like Luke 14, don't expect payback now.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.920]   They're going to kill you, for goodness sakes.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.880]   They're going to malign you and torture you and kill you.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.640]   So expect trouble and affliction and ingratitude in this world, but, oh, oh, remember, your
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.880]   reward will be great.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.200]   Let that sustain you through it all.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.480]   I think this is the explanation for what Paul meant.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.440]   The questioner asked about 1 Corinthians 13.5, what Paul meant in 1 Corinthians 13.5 when
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.760]   he said, "Love seeks not its own."
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   That's the old King James Version, I guess.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Love seeks not its own.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   It's a good literal translation.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:48.000]   He did not mean that love should find no pleasure in or look for any pleasure from the beautiful
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.480]   act of love.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.080]   He meant don't look for that reward by using people for material gain or advancement in
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.140]   this world.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.440]   He didn't mean ignore the promise of great reward in heaven, and the reason we know this
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.200]   from 1 Corinthians 13, not just from the words of Jesus, but from the very context, two verses
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:19.720]   earlier, Paul says, "If I give away all that I have and deliver my body to be burned, but
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.560]   have not love, I gain nothing.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.680]   I gain nothing.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.840]   I gain nothing."
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.720]   The whole argument is you would be a fool to live in a way that gains nothing, and that's
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.040]   the exact point.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.880]   You gain a great reward through giving your life for other people.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.600]   So he's motivating love by long-term gain, not short-term profit, by manipulating people
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.880]   to get richer or to get famous or anything like that.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:01.880]   So C.S. Lewis, you know this, Tony, we love this quote from his great sermon, what's the
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.360]   name of the sermon?
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   The Weight of Glory.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.920]   The Weight of Glory, yes, that's right.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   The Weight of Glory.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:13.480]   "If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and earnestly
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:20.360]   to hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I submit that this has crept in through Immanuel
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.760]   Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.800]   Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.320]   rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.800]   strong but too weak."
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.440]   I remember the first time I read that, I thought, "Oh, unbelievable.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.880]   I can't believe he's saying this.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.480]   This is so right.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.560]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.040]   joy is offered us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in the slum
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.380]   because he cannot imagine what is meant by a holiday at the sea.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.080]   We are far too easily pleased."
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.960]   So the crucial question is, how is this love?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.600]   And I've got two short and I think simple and I hope compelling answers for why is it
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.720]   love to be motivated to love people, to sacrifice for people, give your life for people for
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.000]   the sake of reward.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.920]   Answer number one, there is nothing morally inferior about looking for reward for our
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:37.060]   behavior provided that the reward is ultimately more of Christ as the supreme joy of our souls.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:43.040]   And the reason that's not morally inferior is that Christ is most glorified in us when
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.720]   we're most satisfied in Christ.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.720]   The glory of Christ is at stake.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.600]   It's simply not virtue.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.800]   It's not an honor to Christ to say, I can imagine somebody trying to say this, "Well,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.480]   I'm going to suffer for Christ and it makes no difference to me whether it leads to knowing
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.360]   and enjoying Christ better."
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.000]   That's not a virtue.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.080]   That's self-sufficiency cloaked as a sacrifice.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.080]   It is right.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:19.560]   It is a great honor to Christ to be motivated by a desire for more of him that comes through
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.520]   loving people.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   Here's the last one.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.640]   This is probably the most important.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.160]   It is loving to sacrifice for others with a view to reward, wanting reward, aiming at
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:40.840]   reward if our aim is that in being sustained by this reward of more of Christ, we win people
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.120]   to come with us into the reward.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.400]   That's the goal.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   That's the goal.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.680]   And we can't do that if we don't love the reward.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.220]   There would be nothing to welcome these people into, to entice them into.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.480]   If we have stopped delighting in the very reward we get through loving others.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.320]   So 1 Peter 2.12 says, "Conduct yourselves among the Gentiles in an honorable way so
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.800]   that when they speak evil against you, they may see your good deeds and then," I'm
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:16.920]   paraphrasing now, "join you in glorifying God on the day of visitation."
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:27.640]   Our motive is never, mark this, our motive is never to return good for evil so that we
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.240]   get the reward and they don't.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.840]   Let me say that again.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:43.600]   My motive in returning to someone good for evil is never, "I get a reward, you don't."
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   I want them.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.640]   My motive is in seeking to love them.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.000]   I want them to join me.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.040]   I want them to see in my very behavior the all-satisfying worth of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:04.000]   So my conclusion is never, never, never forget, but always remember, remember that it is more
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.960]   blessed to give than to receive.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.520]   Your reward will be great in heaven.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:14.680]   No matter the cost of love here, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   and a great and wonderful part of that reward will be that in loving people like this, you
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.920]   will win many of them to join you in enjoying the reward.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.400]   Yes, precious motive for Christian charity.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.080]   And speaking of glorious themes in the Bible, J.I.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.240]   Macker in his magnificent book, Knowing God, wrote this, "If you want to judge how well
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   a person understands Christianity, find out how much he makes of the thought of being
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.480]   God's child."
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.360]   So just how key is the theme of sonship in our faith and in our Bibles?
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.080]   I'm going to call up Don Carson.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.640]   He's going to explain, and that is on the podcast tomorrow.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.120]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.960]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   Piper.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   We'll see you tomorrow.
