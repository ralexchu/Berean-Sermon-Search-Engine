[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Well, thank you for the kind words, Pastor Mark.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.260]   I just want to say good morning, Brian, and I send greetings to you from Brian Mission
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.220]   Church in Millbrae.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.600]   We're so thankful for the relationship that our churches have and also for the gospel
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.560]   partnership that we share together in Christ.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.860]   And in particular, I just praise God for this church and for your godly pastors and elders
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.920]   and really the gospel presence that this church has in Orange County and in Southern California.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.320]   And personally, I've seen BCC's ministry in the lives of so many people I know and I've
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.760]   watched from afar as friends have come to faith in Christ and to see others just growing
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.640]   in their walks with the Lord, some of whom are still here and others who are a part of
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640]   our church now.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.200]   And it just brings me such great joy to know and to see how God is working through your
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.420]   church and through your leaders.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.680]   And so I want to thank Pastor Peter and just the elders for the invitation to be here.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.660]   And I'm grateful for the opportunity to bring God's word to you this morning.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.520]   And so if you have your Bible, I invite you to turn with me to Matthew chapter 20, and
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.840]   we'll be looking at verses 1 through 16.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.080]   And as I was thinking about what to preach on, this passage was really on my heart to
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.440]   share.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.120]   It's become one of my favorite parables and it's not as well known as some of the other
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.480]   ones because it's found in Matthew's gospel alone.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.280]   And so I hope just to familiarize you with this story and I trust that it can be encouragement
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   to you this morning.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.360]   Matthew chapter 20, beginning in verse 1, and I'll read our text for us this morning.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.800]   For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.720]   to hire laborers for the vineyard.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.240]   After agreeing with the laborers for denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.160]   And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.320]   And to them he said, you go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.240]   And so they went.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.200]   Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.720]   And about the 11th hour, he went out and found others standing.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.360]   And he said to them, why do you stand here idle all day?
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.240]   They said to him, because no one has hired us.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.480]   He said to them, you go into the vineyard too.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.800]   And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, call the laborers and
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.680]   pay them their wages, beginning with the last up to the first.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.040]   And when those hired about the 11th hour came, each of them received a denarius.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   Verse 10, now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.560]   each of them also received a denarius.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.680]   And on receiving it, they grumbled at the master of the house, saying, these last worked
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.800]   only one hour, and you made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.760]   the scorching heat.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   But he replied to one of them, friend, I am doing you no wrong.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.620]   Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.800]   Take what belongs to you and go.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.280]   I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.960]   Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.560]   Or do you begrudge my generosity?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.600]   So the last will be first, and the first last.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.320]   This is God's holy word.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.480]   Let's pray.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.200]   Father, we ask that as we approach your word this morning, that you would give us ears
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.880]   to hear and eyes to see and hearts ready and eager to receive your word, that we might
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:49.960]   be transformed into the likeness of your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.400]   In whose name we pray, amen.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.480]   One of the first things that we learn to say as children is the phrase, it's not fair.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.960]   And we weren't taught it.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.360]   It's not like someone sat us down and walked us through, this is how you pronounce it.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.960]   Here are all the occasions in life that you'll find it useful.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.280]   Let's practice it together.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   It's not fair.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.240]   No, it's instinctive.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.720]   And we see this especially in kids.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.440]   When they have to share a toy, it's not fair.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   When they have to stop playing their game, it's not fair.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.560]   When they don't get their way, it's not fair.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   It's not fair is one of the first things that we feel and express in life before we even
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.700]   know how to articulate it.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.680]   And we discovered that this carries over to adulthood.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   It's one of the things that we continue to feel most strongly and say most loudly, whether
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.280]   externally or internally, as grownups.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.920]   We feel like our work situation is not fair.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.280]   We feel that our pay is not fair.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.000]   We feel the cost of living in Orange County is not fair.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.160]   Think about maybe when the last time was when you said this phrase.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.960]   For me, it was when my wife, Carissa, picked up Chick-fil-A for me.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   And she was on her way home from a place called Fairfield.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.880]   It's my absolute favorite.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.640]   Chick-fil-A, it is my absolute favorite.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.520]   I actually just had some yesterday.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.760]   And unlike for you guys in SoCal, it's a total treat because we don't live close to one living
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   in San Francisco.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.680]   The closest one is in San Jose, which is an hour away.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.600]   And so when my wife brought some Chick-fil-A back home, I was so excited.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.240]   But when I opened the bag, I found a spicy chicken sandwich with no spicy chicken.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.480]   It was literally two slices of bread, and they left out the chicken in the middle.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.600]   And they had the audacity, for some reason, to leave even the cheese in there.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.080]   So I was like, "Dang, Chick-fil-A, you wrong for this, all right?
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.120]   It's not fair."
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.680]   Most of us, we go through life feeling and thinking that a whole bunch of things aren't
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   fair.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.600]   And don't get me wrong, I'm not dismissing that there is not real injustice in the world.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.640]   We should want our laws and our justice systems and our standards to be fair.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.040]   But here's what I'm getting at.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.240]   All of us put on some lens whereby we look at the world.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.760]   Because none of us just experience the world, but we constantly interpret it.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.600]   And for some of you, it's through the lens of fairness, where we're always assessing
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.520]   what we think we deserve and what others deserve or don't deserve.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.920]   Where we're keenly aware of what people have and what we don't have.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.880]   Where we compare other successes to our failures.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.480]   Where we're cognizant of whether someone's being recognized and whether we're being ignored.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.320]   See, we're always sizing up, we're always calculating, we're always feeling like we're
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.560]   owed something by our family, by our friends, and even by God.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.120]   This has become the socially acceptable and respectable sin.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.600]   It is to look at the world in this way, to be discontent, to envy what people have, to
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.040]   resent God and say, "It's not fair."
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.080]   But there's another way to look at the world.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:36.120]   It's to get up each morning to put on lenses not of fairness, but to put on lenses of grace.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.160]   One writer says that when you do this, you'll see that most days are a lot better than you
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.680]   deserve.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.320]   And on the really hard days, you'll fight to believe that God is working for good.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.000]   With the lenses of grace, you'll rejoice in the success of others.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.080]   Instead of experiencing life as a series of disappointments where you weren't treated
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.480]   as you deserve, you'll experience life as a gift.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.060]   You'll see grace all around you.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.880]   Whatever is good in your life, it's grace.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.000]   Whatever good is in someone else's life, it's grace.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.800]   It's a profoundly different way of looking at the world.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.120]   Jesus tells a parable that challenges our tendency to view life through the lens of
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:30.240]   fairness, and shows us that instead, life is to be seen through grace.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.200]   That's what this account is all about.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.800]   It's a story that highlights the beauty of God's grace to us in the gospel, and it's
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.200]   meant to inform the way that we live life.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.600]   And as we go through this passage, I want us to see three things here.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.760]   We see the parable itself, the purpose for why it's told, and then the principle that's
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.240]   found in this story.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.960]   If you're taking notes, the first thing that I want to look at is the parable.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.100]   And I just want to walk us through this account, and so you can follow along in your Bibles.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.580]   In verse 1, it begins like this, "For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.500]   who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard."
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.780]   Verse 1 sets the context of this parable for us.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:28.220]   Jesus tells a story to illustrate what the kingdom of heaven is like.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.740]   And in this story, there is the master.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:38.460]   He is the landowner who has a vineyard and is in need of laborers for that vineyard.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.420]   And at this time, it's likely September, and it's harvesting season.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.860]   The weather was still hot, and so it was important to gather grapes before the rain came and
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.620]   destroyed everything.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.540]   And so harvesting was in great demand at this time.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.400]   And you never really had enough manpower to do that in terms of a permanent staff.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.680]   And so you needed to very quickly find part-time laborers to get the harvest in on time.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.980]   Now in those days, the workday was usually from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.540]   The man in the story we're told goes out early in the morning before 6 a.m. to find laborers
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.340]   for his vineyard.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.780]   And he makes his way to the marketplace of town nearby.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.440]   And there he would find men standing, waiting for work.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.760]   It'd be like a scene from that of the Great Depression, where there would be people waiting
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.980]   for someone to hire them, and they're waiting along the docks, just waiting for someone
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.760]   to be able to hire them for work.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.600]   These laborers were usually unskilled.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.080]   They didn't have much to offer.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.240]   They were desperate for work in those days.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.320]   They were unemployed except for a day at a time, never knowing when the next job would
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   come.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.940]   See, life for them was precarious.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.280]   It was difficult because they had to work in order to eat, and if they didn't work,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.620]   then they couldn't eat, and neither could their families.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.460]   And so they would congregate in the marketplace, and there they would wait for someone to come
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.960]   along to get them work.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.240]   And so the master in the story went to the marketplace and saw these men on this particular
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.920]   day, and he would say, "You, you, and you, come and work in my vineyard."
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   And he set the terms, "I'll give you one denarius for one day's work."
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.040]   And that would have been very fair.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.400]   In fact, a very generous wage for unskilled workers.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:41.240]   And so these men agree, and in verse 2, he sent them into his vineyard to begin work.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.800]   But then we're told three hours later, at the third hour, which is 9 a.m., the landowner
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.280]   comes back to the marketplace to find more workers.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.180]   And it says in verse 3 this, "And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.600]   idle in the marketplace."
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.300]   No one's hired this group.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.520]   They're unemployed, and they're looking for work too.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.580]   And so to those, verse 4, the master said, "You go into the vineyard too, and whatever's
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.280]   right I will give you."
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.840]   No negotiation of wages takes place.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.800]   The landowner simply promises rightful pay for appropriate work, and off they go to the
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.000]   vineyard.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.440]   But the story goes, the master comes back to the marketplace on three more occasions.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.160]   He goes out again at noon, at 3 p.m., and once more at 5 p.m.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.640]   Now this is one hour before the end of the workday.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.300]   And he sees men still standing there at this hour.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.980]   And so he asks them, verse 6, "Why do you stand here idle all day?"
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.740]   And their response is, "Because no one's hired us."
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.840]   And he said to them, "You too go into my vineyard and work."
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:13:00.740]   Realize, this master is a compassionate man.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.720]   When he finds out the reason that they're there is simply because no one wanted them
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.960]   and no one hired them, though they were willing to work, he hires them for just one hour.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.320]   They waited all day, stayed all day, likely thinking that with each passing hour they
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.860]   weren't going to find work.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:26.640]   But against all hope, this generous man shows up and he says, "Just go, and whatever's right
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   I'll give you."
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:36.680]   And you can imagine, they're grateful to have been hired this late in the day.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.280]   And so that's the first part of the story.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:46.000]   A landowner hires five successive waves of workers at 6 a.m., 9 a.m., 12 p.m., 3 p.m.,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.620]   and 5 p.m.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.600]   And he sends them off to work in his vineyard.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.080]   But now it's 6 p.m.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.800]   The bell is rung, the whistle's blown, it's the end of the workday.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.460]   And as was the custom, everyone lines up to get paid.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.320]   But a couple of interesting things happen here.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.280]   First in verse 8, "When evening came, it says the landowner said to his foreman, 'Call the
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:20.700]   laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last up to the first.'
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.000]   The owner asked his manager to pay the last hired workers first."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.120]   And so you think, well, isn't that a little odd?
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.760]   Usually we pay workers in order of hiring, the first to the last.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.920]   But this master instead gives specific instruction to do the opposite.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:45.220]   The workers who are hired last get paid first, and those who are hired first get paid last.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.800]   And so these men who work for one hour, maybe even less when you account for travel time
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.040]   from the marketplace to the vineyard, they're in the front of the line.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.520]   And those who worked all 12 hours are in the back of the line.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.720]   And so that's unusual.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.920]   But then a second unusual thing happens.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:14.640]   Verse 9, "And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.600]   So, the workers who were hired at the end of the day, worked less than one hour, got
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   a denarius.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.800]   How do you think they reacted?
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.600]   Like, well, this is crazy.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.040]   We work less than an hour and we get an entire day's wage.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.320]   This is unbelievable.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   Life is good.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.800]   And so they're feeling that way, right?
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.080]   Now how do you think those at this point are feeling in the back of the line?
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.040]   They see this and they're getting excited.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.080]   They're thinking, "What are we going to get?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.920]   If they get a denarius for one hour of work, do the math, we work 12 hours, we get 12 denarii,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   right?
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.680]   We're going to have a little extra in the bank.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.960]   We're going to buy that Tesla Model X, right?
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.400]   We're going to have a happy commute home, right?"
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:11.480]   But in verse 10, it tells us that when they got to the front of the line, they thought
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:19.880]   they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:25.400]   They had this silent expectation that when their turn came, they would receive more because
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.600]   they'd worked longer than everyone else.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.560]   And when that didn't happen, they couldn't hide their disappointment.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:40.320]   It says this in verse 11, "And on receiving this one denarius, they grumbled at the master
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.640]   of the house, saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.'"
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.880]   They were saying, "These guys who worked in the cool of the day for one hour, and we worked
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.260]   in the scorching heat for the entire day, they get paid what we get paid?"
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.960]   And so the master replies to this group of men.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.360]   And this is really the heart of the story.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.040]   So let's finish reading the account together.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:20.200]   Verse 13, "He replied to one of them," notice what he calls him, "Friend, friend, I'm doing
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   you no wrong.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.680]   Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.080]   Take what belongs to you and go.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.240]   I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.260]   Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.040]   Or do you begrudge my generosity?
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:44.280]   So the last will be first, and the first last."
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.600]   So that's the parable.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.320]   It ends just like that.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.280]   It's a simple story, but we know it's more than that.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.440]   And so what's the point?
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.120]   What's the purpose of this parable that Jesus tells us?
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.800]   I believe there are two purposes that we can find here for why Jesus tells this story.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:15.280]   One, I believe this parable is told to show that God's grace is manifested in our salvation.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.200]   See, this parable is really about Christ.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.760]   He is front and center in the story.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.280]   Our Lord is unmistakably cast here as the landowner.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.640]   He is the master of the estate.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.320]   He owns the vineyard.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:37.160]   And specifically, the story is about his grace and the salvation that he offers to sinners.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.520]   That's what the denarius in the story represents, salvation.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.960]   So how do we know this?
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:50.080]   Well, this parable, if you read it in its context, is a continuation of what Jesus has
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.840]   been teaching on in the chapter before in Matthew 19.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.280]   And there we have an account of the rich young ruler.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.000]   And if you remember the story, in verse 16, this young man approaches the Lord and he
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.760]   asks him this question, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit what?
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.440]   Eternal life."
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.480]   That's the topic of discussion here.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.840]   And so from there, Jesus begins to teach on eternal life.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.200]   And he then tells the story about the vineyard to illustrate truths regarding this eternal
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   life.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.440]   And he highlights specifically God's compassion and his love and his grace towards sinners
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.560]   as the one who gives eternal life.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.320]   And this truth is found throughout the entire story.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:46.640]   Jesus cast in the story not only the landowner, but the hired workers.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.760]   And as I alluded to, life for them was desperate.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:58.720]   What they were in the marketplace tells us that they were in need of some kind of work.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.360]   In those days, these workers were near the bottom of the socioeconomic scale, just above
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   a beggar.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.680]   So you realize that day laborers were regarded as the lowest class of workers.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   Why?
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.920]   Because they were unskilled.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.580]   They were untrained.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.000]   They were unemployed except for a day at a time working from job to job to job.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.320]   Simply, they didn't have much to offer.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.640]   And so each morning they would line up in the marketplace in hopes of being hired.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.320]   And on this particular morning, this landowner, he goes out and he finds these men waiting
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.320]   there.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.240]   And so he brings them to his vineyard to work.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.920]   Now at this point, nothing really seems out of the ordinary.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.280]   And it's what happens in the third hour and beyond that tells you something more about
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.640]   this master.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:01.160]   This man goes back out not once, not twice, not three times, but four more times to bring
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.980]   more workers into the vineyard.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.360]   And each time he found them, the story emphasizes that these workers were what?
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.120]   It says that they were idle.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.760]   Not that they were willfully idle, but they couldn't find work.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.320]   And so they waited.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:28.200]   And as they waited, it was the landowner himself who initiates, who seeks out, who calls for
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.760]   these laborers and brings them to be part of his work.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:40.120]   And as we read this, the question that we inevitably ask is, why does he keep coming
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   back out?
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.840]   Does he not know how many people it takes to harvest this?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   This master not have foresight to plan accordingly.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.440]   You think that after a while, he would say, "Okay, well, there's this much land and it
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.440]   takes this many people working this many hours to gather this many grapes."
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.800]   So why does he keep coming back out?
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   The only answer is that he represents God.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:11.480]   And he's coming back not because he needs more workers, but because he wants to give
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.360]   work.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.040]   He wants to give of his riches.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:24.200]   He goes to the marketplace and he sees these men in their situation, unhired, unwanted,
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.480]   unneeded, and his heart breaks for them.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.280]   And he has compassion on these workers who really had nothing to offer.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.040]   And this is so evident that the quality of workers who are available lessens as the day
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.320]   goes on and each time that he comes out.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:49.720]   See, because it would be the young, the strong, the capable who are gone first on any occasion,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.760]   and yet this master, he goes and he finds these second, third, fourth-tier men.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.880]   They were the ones who were idle.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.320]   Remember when he asked, "Well, why are you standing there idle?"
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.460]   They more or less replied, "Well, because no one wants us."
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.200]   They were the leftovers.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.560]   They were the scraps for work because they were older, they were slower, they were less
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.560]   capable.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.240]   They didn't have as much to offer.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:23.680]   And yet the landowner looks upon them with a heart of compassion.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.040]   He tells them, "You two, go to my vineyard.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.120]   Do my work.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.280]   And whatever is right, I'll pay you."
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.660]   And with gratitude they go.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.840]   And he does this up until the very last group of workers and he's saying, "There's only
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.160]   an hour left in the workday.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.720]   I don't need you.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.200]   You can't do much.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.160]   You can't contribute much to my vineyard.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.400]   But I want you anyway.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.140]   I want to set you to work.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.320]   I want to pay you."
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.960]   Do you see?
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.820]   This was us in the marketplace.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:15.480]   The marketplace is where religion has left each of us.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.600]   Religion has told us that we need to work in order to earn our way to God, in order
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.960]   to earn salvation, but religion always leaves us desperate, always looking for more work
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.940]   to do, always falling short, never doing enough to earn heaven.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.000]   And the result isn't being with God.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.400]   It is separation from God.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.040]   And as sinners, we were hopeless and condemned in our situation.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.120]   And it is here that God meets us where we're at.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.320]   He sees our sin and our desperate situation and He has mercy.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.120]   He comes to the marketplace of this world and He seeks to bring those undeserving into
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:02.480]   His kingdom, not because He needed us, but because He loved us, because He sought after
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.960]   us and He has made a way for us to be brought into the kingdom.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.620]   The Bible tells us that God would provide a Savior for our sin.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.760]   He sends His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for our sins and in our place to
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.020]   pay the debt that we owed and take the judgment that you and I deserved.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.840]   But on the third day, He rose from the grave for our justification, conquering sin and
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.840]   death.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:35.340]   And as the living God, He promises that if you renounce your sins and works and instead
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:40.480]   trust in My work on the cross, you can be saved.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:47.400]   See, God is looking for those who are willing to say with a humble heart, "We're not
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.040]   good enough."
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.520]   He wants a heart that says, "I have nothing.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.720]   I can do nothing.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.800]   I offer nothing.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.320]   But I need God for all things."
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:09.720]   God seeks those who don't trust themselves for salvation, but those who throw themselves
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.860]   at the mercy of God.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.600]   And it is when men and women are at this place and they acknowledge their sin and their need
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.480]   for grace and mercy that God will bring us to His vineyard, His kingdom, and to give
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.920]   us eternal life.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.400]   God is trying to impress to us the futility of the religion of works where man tries to
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.800]   do as much as he can to be saved and instead points us to the gospel of grace where God
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   has done it all for us to be saved in Jesus Christ through faith in Him.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.840]   So we see that God's grace is manifested in our salvation.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.760]   Second, we see that God's grace is manifested equally.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.920]   This is the other purpose for why the Lord tells this parable.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.680]   All who come into Christ's kingdom to serve Him, no matter how long, no matter how short,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:08.000]   will in the end equally receive the same reward.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   In this parable, if you go back to it, some worked 12-hour days, some worked nine, some
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   worked six, some worked three, some worked less than one hour, but realize that in the
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.080]   end, they all received the same pay.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:29.320]   The point that Jesus makes is those who come first to God will receive no more than those
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.480]   who come last.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:38.680]   And those who come last will receive no less than those who come first.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.720]   The same eternal life will be given to the sinner who turns from Christ at the end of
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:50.080]   his life, who turns from sin to Christ at the end of his life, as is given to the missionary
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.600]   who spent 50 years in a remote tribe in Africa.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.480]   Brothers and sisters, I want to tell you that is an encouraging thing, that while life may
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:05.680]   be inequitable, God isn't, and eternity won't be either.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.920]   Every believer, no matter when converted or what manner of service or for how long, will
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.840]   receive the same reward of heaven just like everyone else.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.760]   But there's another aspect to this, because this issue of equality of grace doesn't just
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.040]   deal with length of time, but notice here also to experience.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.360]   You go back to the parable.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:38.840]   See for the earlier group who worked, their complaint was it wasn't just that they worked
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.560]   all 12 hours, but you notice their response upon receiving the same one denarius as everyone
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   else.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.840]   Verse 12, it says, "These workers, these last workers who worked only one hour, you have
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.600]   made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat."
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   See what they appealed to and why they accused the master of unfairness wasn't how long they
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   worked, but how hard they worked.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.960]   These men, it says, bore the burden of the day.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.120]   They were under the scorching heat.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.800]   They felt the oppressive sun of Palestine.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.420]   It was painful labor.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.420]   They were hungry.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.200]   They were thirsty.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.240]   They were tired.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:32.160]   These men had worked long and they worked so hard for their denarius.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:40.120]   This parable is in fact told as a response to what Peter says in the chapter right before.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:46.840]   In verse 27 of Matthew 19, Peter says, "Lord, we've left everything to follow you.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.440]   What then will we have?"
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.360]   See these disciples were saying this to our Lord.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:59.320]   "Jesus, we've left everything and we've already endured three years of deprivation in the
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.920]   summer heat of working the harvest.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.240]   We've been out here in the hot sun and we felt the persecution.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.280]   We've endured opposition.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:14.000]   We've experienced the hostility and yet we see others now following you and they get
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.320]   the same thing we do?"
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.560]   That's what Peter is saying here.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.040]   It's coming from a place where they felt that things were unfair.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:29.360]   Let me try to give you a sports analogy to maybe illustrate this truth.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.840]   Sports analogy is about the Golden State Warriors.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:38.440]   I live in the Bay Area with all these Warriors fans and it's terrible.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.640]   Even worse that they won three championships in four years.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.520]   Whatever your loyalty lies, I mean, objectively we have to give it up.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.920]   This was one of the all-time great teams in NBA history.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.240]   I'm a Kings fan, so pray for me, but I'm from Sacramento.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.940]   There was legit happiness that I had for Warriors fans because I know that they've endured the
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.120]   decades of losing.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.960]   They've gone through the dark ages of the Fontego Cummings, the Bob Sear, the Eric Dampier
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   teams.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.320]   The reward is that much sweeter for them because they won.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.960]   At the same time, living in the Bay Area, I noticed this.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:23.240]   I've observed that these same fans aren't happy that they're now sharing this mountaintop
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:29.840]   experience with people who became fans way back in 2015.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.920]   They know who they are.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:37.200]   It's not fair because they're thinking, "We've endured through all that losing and pain and
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.960]   money spent on Adonofoil jerseys."
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.840]   That reminds me that long-time suffering fans are those who worked the morning and labored
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.760]   in the heat of the day.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:55.200]   The 2015 fans are the ones who worked for one hour in the cool evening breeze.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.760]   Now older fans are being told, "You guys are actually equal, and we have to share this
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.200]   together the same."
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.720]   In our economy of things, that doesn't seem right.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.800]   That's how these disciples felt.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:18.160]   See, they counted the cost from the beginning, and now there were those who just started
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.080]   following Jesus.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.680]   The disciples were thinking, "These guys are jumping on the bandwagon at the last minute
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   here.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.320]   Surely, we should get more than they, Jesus, because we've been through so much for you
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.160]   already."
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:41.640]   It really illustrates this truth on a more sobering note that there are believers who
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.960]   come to faith in Christ in some of the most difficult places in the world where they have
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.360]   endured so much suffering.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.900]   Their labor is hard.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:01.360]   They sacrifice much, even their lives.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:08.460]   It's a sobering truth that we at times forget that at this very moment, we are enjoying
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:16.800]   the freedom to worship while believers around the world are in bondage, are persecuted,
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.400]   are being martyred for their faith in Christ.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.320]   An average of at least 180 Christians around the world are killed each month for their
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   faith.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:34.720]   In 41 of 50 of the worst nations for persecution, Christians are the group being persecuted
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.360]   most and targeted by extremists.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.200]   More Christians, we're told by historians, have been martyred in the 20th century alone
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.560]   than all other centuries combined.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:55.000]   90,000 Christians were killed for their faith last year alone, with many more who suffer
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.680]   and die unaccounted for, forgotten, and largely unknown.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:14.040]   See, they are those who work here, the 12-hour days and the scorching heat.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:20.560]   They are those workers in this parable who have worked hard, who have suffered much,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.520]   who have sacrificed greatly under the harsh sun in the vineyard.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:31.600]   And they stand in contrast to those who work in the one hour and the cool evening breeze,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.200]   those like the thief on the cross.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:40.920]   This man who was a criminal for his entire life, living a wicked life, people like him
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.160]   will turn to Christ in the last moment of their lives, and they will get the same eternal
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.880]   life as those who suffer all their lives for the sake of Christ, those who give their lives
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.840]   for Christ, men like Stephen and Paul and John Hus and William Tyndale and Dietrich
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.760]   Bonhoeffer and Richard Wurmbrand, those slaughtered for the faith.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:07.240]   And the question we ask is, is that fair?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.320]   Brothers and sisters, the answer is no.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.000]   It is not fair.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.120]   It is grace.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.320]   They are those in this parable who have worked the 12-hour days.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.680]   We know not everyone's faith is like that.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:34.800]   They're those who serve Christ in contrast in the coolness of the evening breeze, those
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:42.080]   like many of us, where there are seemingly no sacrifices for their entire lives.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.320]   They are born in free and prosperous nations.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.120]   They have great jobs.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.680]   They accumulate wealth.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.480]   They own their own homes.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.800]   They drive nice cars.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.720]   They vacation anywhere around the world.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.820]   They have good health.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.560]   They can live out their faith in freedom without any fear of persecution.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.440]   You look at us, and we've not shed one drop of blood for the gospel, at least to my knowledge.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.600]   Sure, I've been criticized.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:17.720]   I've been opposed by my parents for my faith for a time, and I've endured mild hostility,
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:24.680]   but I've not shed one drop of blood for Christ because I am one of those who have labored
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   in the cool evening breeze of the vineyard.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:34.760]   And oftentimes I ask myself this question, is that fair?
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.820]   Is that fair that I would receive this one denarius, this eternal life in the glories
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.240]   of heaven with all those who go through so much suffering?
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.320]   Is that fair?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.080]   No, it's not fair.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.280]   It's grace.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:01.520]   Jesus is telling us all who come into the kingdom to serve him no matter how hard, no
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:11.360]   matter how easy the circumstances will in the end equally receive the same full reward.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:19.160]   We ask, why would God allow us to suffer so little compared to those who are in the world
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.080]   suffering so much?
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.320]   Why would God bless us with so much when others have so little?
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:33.520]   Why would God allow us to enjoy what we have while others are deprived?
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.000]   We don't know.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.640]   It's only by his grace.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.840]   And all we can do is marvel.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.880]   We bow our knee and we praise God.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:55.200]   This leads to the third and final point, the principle here.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.480]   There's a practical application found in this story, and it's simply this, that the grace
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:08.020]   of God is to affect the way that we see life.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:14.520]   When it came time for the first workers to receive their pay, they took exception.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.840]   But notice what the master says, verse 13.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.280]   But he replied to one of them, "Friend, I'm doing you no wrong.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.120]   Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.600]   Take what belongs to you and go.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.000]   I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.600]   Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me, or do you begrudge my
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.520]   generosity?"
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.680]   You notice what the master is saying?
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.600]   The master is saying that he kept his end of the deal.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.480]   He was just.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.200]   He did no wrong here.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.600]   They agreed to a denarius, and that's exactly what he gave.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.640]   And when he chooses to pay the latter group, he's saying it was completely his right to
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.400]   do so.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.120]   And so he says here, the problem isn't injustice, because he gave as he said he would.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.040]   Instead, he identifies the problem with you guys.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.320]   The problem is jealousy.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.820]   The problem is envy.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.820]   It is selfishness.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:16.680]   See, and the master says this, "Or do you begrudge my generosity?"
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:25.900]   The literal translation for this in the Greek is, "Is your eye evil because I am good?"
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:31.960]   The landowner asked whether they were seeing with an evil eye, whether their perception
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:37.280]   was wrong, whether their perspective was wrong.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   And the obvious answer is yes.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.640]   And this really gets to the heart of the problem here.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.240]   See, this isn't about the denarius that they received.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.320]   It's about the denarius they saw others receive.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:59.040]   In verse 12, you notice the workers complained, "You made them equal to us," not, "You made
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.480]   us equal to them."
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.680]   It wasn't that they were upset about the pay they received.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.600]   They were upset that others received the same pay as them.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   They resented the generosity of the master to people who they felt weren't deserving.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.360]   This sort of perception of people in life led to this greater problem that our Lord
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.080]   alludes to.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:31.960]   They focused on what others got rather than being thankful for what they got, far more
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.480]   than they deserved.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.160]   And Jesus rebukes His disciples for this.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.100]   When they were complaining, "It's not fair.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.600]   What more do we get?"
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.640]   Our Lord said, "You're wrong."
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.520]   And I think this speaks to the issue of their heart and it spoke to this really issue of
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.760]   unthankfulness.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.440]   And I believe that this is a word to all of us.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:04.760]   Because let me ask you this, are you a thankful person?
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.640]   Or are you someone who lacks gratitude?
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.520]   Now if you don't know the answer to that question, let me help you.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:17.960]   And I just want to give you a series of diagnostic questions to ask yourselves.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:26.480]   Would people who know you characterize you as a complaining person or a thankful person?
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:33.200]   How often do you point out something wrong with work, people, and life in your conversations?
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:42.520]   Conversely, how often do you affirm evidences of grace in your life and in your conversations?
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.680]   Do you look at the world and find many reasons to complain because things aren't going your
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.440]   way?
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.240]   Or do you look at the world and find yourself blown away at the many reasons that you have
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.400]   every day to give thanks to God?
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:07.500]   Do you view yourself as someone who has been constantly shortchanged and neglected?
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:16.000]   Or do you view yourself as one who has been unfairly showered with blessings?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.160]   Think about the way that you talk.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.240]   Do you often say, "If only I had this or if this was different."
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:29.040]   Or do you often say instead, "I can't believe God has given me this."
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.400]   Is that a part of your vocabulary?
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:42.460]   Those questions are searching and they're humbling and they sober us.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:48.200]   Because far too often we are more like these mourning laborers than we like to admit.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.520]   We look at life through the lens of our perceived fairness, that he has such a nice job and
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.140]   making good pay and I have this one.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.280]   They always get invited to things and I don't.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.440]   All the guys notice her and they don't notice me.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.900]   Their marriage and their kids seem so good and ours doesn't.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:16.440]   They have everything going on for them in life and life is hard for me and the cry is
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.120]   always the same.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.560]   It's not fair.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.960]   That's coming from a place where you think you deserve better, certainly better than
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   others.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.400]   And why you feel that way is because you don't really think of yourself as a sinner as you
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.280]   want.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:47.920]   But God desires for us to instead put on lenses of grace, to see the gospel, to see the cross,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.300]   to see that grace is amazing once again.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:57.460]   That the God of this universe would love me and give me the greatest thing in his son
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.000]   Jesus Christ.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.720]   He continues to give me more than I ever deserve.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:14.100]   Jesus is having us recalibrate our view and light of the cross to see who we really are.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.240]   That we're simply sinners who have been saved by grace and we see that there's nothing good
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.380]   in you and me and we have nothing unless God grants it.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:29.000]   And it's when we see ourselves and life in this way, feelings of humility and thankfulness
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.360]   rather than entitlement and disappointment fill the heart.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.880]   When we see through the lens of grace and the light of the gospel, you'll have reasons
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.520]   to be grateful everywhere you look.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:51.680]   There will even be moments when your life is marked by disappointment and loss and trials
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:57.640]   and you find yourself amidst your suffering asking, "Why is this happening to me?
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.840]   Why is this happening to people we love?"
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.040]   And we ask God, "Where is your grace?"
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:11.760]   And God will say through the lens of grace, "It's there in your sufferings."
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:17.320]   When we struggle, we're to fix our eyes back on the cross.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:24.880]   And as we do so, I'll guarantee you the world will look like a different place, a better
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:33.200]   place and God will appear as he truly is, the God of grace who gives us better than
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.600]   we deserve.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:42.360]   Is this not the more satisfying way to live?
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:48.160]   Is this not the more appropriate way to view the world and to view ourselves, to see it
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.680]   all through the grace of God and the gospel?
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:58.480]   And I'll tell you that every day is a fight in our hearts to do this.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   In the exhortation that I give you, Berean Community Church, let us be disciplined to
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.120]   see and to live in light of grace.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.680]   Let's pray.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:26.920]   Father, we thank you that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:34.320]   We were undeserving of anything but judgment and yet, Lord, you showed us grace.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:42.280]   Help us to be grateful for the salvation that we have in Christ, not feeling entitlement
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:50.000]   but seeing all that we have as grace upon grace from your generous hand.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:58.080]   And in those moments that we complain, when we feel discontent, when we're tempted to
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:05.160]   be resentful for what we have and what we're going through, help us to see Christ, to look
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:14.400]   upon the cross, to celebrate your grace once again and to say that Jesus is all we truly
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.440]   need.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.680]   He is our everything.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.120]   He is our great treasure.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.840]   And it's in his name we pray.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.920]   Amen.
