[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   >> Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And again, we had a great time of retreat this last weekend.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And those of you who were not able to go,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   we have the retreat sermons that are online.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So you can download it and you can go back and
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   listen to it as much as you want, whenever you can.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   First of all, the book, Master's Plan for the Church,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   that we are reading together as a church for
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   this next session of Bible study, it's being sold outside.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So as you enter, as you're going outside,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   you'll see a table out there with books.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And so those books are $10 each.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   If you buy it on your own, it's gonna be about $17, $18.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So we're able to get a group discount.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So if you need to pick one up, please go pick one up.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   You will need to have that if you are attending Bible study.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   If you have an old version of that, the chapters are the same,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   the pages are different, but the chapters are the same.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So you are able to use that book so you can hold on to that.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   If you need new ones, again, it's being sold outside as you are exiting.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Bible study PTA babysitting sign-ups today at the courtyard.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So we have a new ministry that's being led by our brother Alex Koh,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and he's gonna be helping us to find babysitters
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and establish babysitters in our home group in our Wednesday Bible study.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And so if you're willing to put your name on there
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   where they can contact you for help,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   if you can go to the table, it's, again, set up outside,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and just sign your name up and then what your availability is,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   and they'll contact you when they're in need of it.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So please, if you're able to do that and serve in that way,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   you can go out to the table and sign up right after service.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   BAM Retreat, if you're part of the singles ministry,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the topic is God-centered evangelism.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's happening on September 13th through the 15th over the weekend.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And so they told me to announce that today is the very last day that you can sign up.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   There's actually quite a few people who've already signed up for this,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   but today is the very last day.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So if you are new to the church and you are part of that ministry,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   you're not part of the college, you're not part of the family ministry,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   this ministry is for you.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And if you want to sign up for that, today is the very last day.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So they're going up on Friday and come back on Sunday afternoon,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   so Sunday worship will be happening there for the BAM ministry.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   We have an announcement from our women's ministry.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Okay.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Hello.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Hi, church family.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   The women's ministry will be hosting a new event for all sisters,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   high school age and up.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   This event will be called "This is My Story, This is My Song,"
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and will be a time where we hear from a few of our very own Burian sisters
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   as they share about God's transformative work in their lives,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and we'll also be singing their chosen song of praise.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   We hope that you'll be able to join us,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   as it is a rare opportunity for us to be able to share,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   be mutually encouraged,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   and exalt God as sisters in the different life stages that we're in.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   The event will be on Saturday, October 19th, from 8:30 to noon,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   here in the main sanctuary.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   There is a $10 fee as breakfast and snacks will be served.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Please look out for the Google form that's going to be posted on the various
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Facebook ministry pages, and if you have any questions,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   please direct them to Nicole Moes.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Thank you.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You guys are so awkward.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Okay.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   All right, Sprouts PTA.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   If you have a child in the kindergarten through sixth grade,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   there is a meeting for the parents on September 1st,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   that's next Sunday, between 2 and 3 o'clock.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And so they're going to be going over the schedule, the programs,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   the curriculum, that type of stuff,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   so it would be very helpful for you to attend that meeting.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So if you have a child between K through sixth grade,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   next Sunday at 2 p.m. in the main sanctuary.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Okay?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Before I pray for the offering, I want to give a brief encouragement.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And, again, I'm not saying this because there's something wrong
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   or I've seen something wrong,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   but I think sometimes we get in the habit of giving without much thinking
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   because it's like it's time to give, or I have it,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   or maybe I got paid and it's time to give my tithe.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And when we're younger, if you grew up in the church,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   you probably remember the Sunday school teachers
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   or even your parents getting you a crisp $1 bill,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   putting it into an envelope, or putting it into the Bible,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   so when you give, that you're giving the best.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   You're not giving something like you just crumpled it in your pocket
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and just throw it into the thing.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   So we teach that to our children so that they may have reverence
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   and intention in the way that they're giving.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And so that should not stop when we're young because we got older.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So even in our giving as adults,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   that we should give intentionally out of an act of worship.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Sometimes we just give because it's time to give.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And so, again, I'm not saying this because I've noticed anything wrong.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   There's a reason we took a while.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   We actually even wrestled over should we shut down online giving
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   because we want people to be thoughtful and intentional even as they give,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   but obviously times have changed, right?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And so even writing checks, I'm sure at some point in church history,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   they say, "Shouldn't we be writing checks?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Shouldn't it be cash?"
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Or, "Prior to that, shouldn't we be giving our produce?"
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So times have changed, right?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   But as we do that, because it's so easy and convenient
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   that we can just kind of push a button and then we're done.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So I just wanted to remind our church
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   that the giving is an act of worship out of abundance, a thanksgiving,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   so that even as you give, that you would give prayerfully,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that this is coming before the Lord, expressing his lordship over our lives,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and as an act of thanksgiving, that you would give intentionally.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So let me pray for us for our offering.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Again, if you brought a physical offering, there's an offering box in the back.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   But after we pray, after our main worship,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   our sister Jane Shin is going to come up, give her testimony,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Father, we thank you for your grace.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Thank you for the privilege to be able to come and worship you.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Lord, we know that everything that we do week after week
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   can easily become a habit that we don't give much thought to.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I pray that that would never be the case in the way that we worship you.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I pray, Father God, if we've just come into this room out of habit,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   that you would examine our hearts,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   that you would cause us, Lord God, to be intentional in everything that we do,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   that you would receive the glory and the honor that you deserve,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   that you would fill our hearts with gratitude, thanksgiving, and worship,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and that we would come to sing praise, to give, and listen,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and to apply all that you have for us.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   May this offering be given to you as an act of thanksgiving,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.940]   We will continue our worship.

[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.260]   (bell chimes)
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:17.760]   - Hello, my name is Jane, and this is my testimony.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   One of my earliest memories is of
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   our mom teaching Sunday school at our church in Panama.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.760]   Wherever we moved thereafter,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   she made sure we were committed to a church.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.760]   Thanks to God's providence
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   and the early exposure to his word,
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   I grew up knowing about him and what he did for me.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.760]   But for many years, it was just head knowledge.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   It wasn't until we moved to the States when I was 13,
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   and my youth pastor shared with me
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   about sin and repentance.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   It was then the gospel became personal to me
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   and that I accepted Christ as my savior.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   It was also then when I was sprinkled.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.760]   Life had always been good in the worldly sense,
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.760]   but after knowing it was all ordained by God,
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   my joy grew in immeasurable ways.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.760]   I was eager and confident to share about him.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   But if life before Christ
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   was a life unaware of what sin meant,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   now it seemed like my life was a constant wrestling with it.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   Through high school and college,
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   I wrestled with envy and loneliness,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   then pride and self-reliance once I started working.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   As a new mom,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.760]   I wrestled with discontentment and anger,
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   and having another baby didn't mean it was any easier.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760]   But on the days when I felt defeated,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.760]   I was reminded of his sovereignty and love
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.760]   through his word from verses
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.760]   like Romans 5, 3-5 and James 1, 2-4.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   And even when I was full of doubt
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   and bitterness after our mom passed away three years ago today,
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.760]   God in his kindness
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.760]   loved me through a patient husband and sweet children,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   a loving family and kind and faithful friends.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   When nothing anyone said or did seemed to help,
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.760]   it was God's words that breathed in hope
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   and joy into my heart.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   And as it says in Jeremiah 31, 13,
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   he truly turns my mourning into joy.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.760]   He comforts me and gives me joy for my sorrows.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   Today I am getting baptized by full immersion
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.760]   as an act of obedience
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.760]   and a testament of his faithfulness
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.760]   and steadfast love for me,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.760]   burying my old life and persevering in this new life in Christ.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.760]   Thank you.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.760]   [applause]
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:49.760]   Usually when we have the college students get baptized here,
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   we have a row of college students in the back,
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.760]   but today you have all the moms standing over there
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   supporting you.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   So Jane, do you understand when you go into the water
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   you're being united with Christ's death
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   and you're coming out being united to his resurrected life?
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   [applause]
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   [applause]
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   All right, thank you, Jane, for that encouraging testimony.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 9,
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.760]   and we're going to be reading from verse 1 through 6.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.760]   Luke 9, verses 1 through 6.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   "And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.760]   over all the demons and to heal diseases.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.760]   And he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.760]   and to perform healing.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   And he said to them, 'Take nothing for your journey,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.760]   neither a staff nor a bag nor bread nor money,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   and do not even have two tunics apiece.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.760]   And as for those who do not receive you as you go out from that city,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.'
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   Departing, they began going throughout the villages,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   preaching the gospel and healing everywhere."
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   Let's pray.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   We pray your Holy Spirit would illuminate us,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   that we would understand more than knowledge,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   that you would give us eager hearts to listen and to obey.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.760]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   We're about two years into Jesus' ministry,
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   or about a year, depending on what timeline you use,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   about a year and a half before Jesus heads to the cross.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   Jesus made it very clear what his intention was with the disciples.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   He didn't just tell them, "Follow me and we'll figure something out.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   I want to train you and do this and that."
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   He made it very clear, a single purpose.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   He said, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   That was his goal.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   For three years, he walked with them, trained them,
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   so that when he heads to the cross,
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.760]   that after he leaves, that they would take the baton
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.760]   and continue to go after men,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   that they would learn how to be fishers of men.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   Well, the training that he gives here
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   is specifically designed for the Twelve Apostles.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   It's important for us, especially with our generation,
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   where there's so much resources, so many books.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   You go to any Christian bookstore,
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   and how to evangelize, evangelism programs.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.760]   There's so much training, so much education,
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   and different opinions on how we ought to approach,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.760]   how we design church, how we design small group.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.760]   But we need to see, like, what was Jesus' method
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.760]   of training these Twelve, right?
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   This morning, I want to look at three specific things
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   that he mentions here, and hopefully we gain some insight
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   as to his training and how he prepared them.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   And next week, we're going to be looking at the other two,
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   which I won't mention for this morning,
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.760]   so this will be a two-part sermon.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   We're going to start today and look at, first of all,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   who it was that he sent, the Twelve Apostles.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.760]   The first thing that we notice about these Twelve Apostles
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   were who they were not, first and foremost.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   One, there's Twelve Apostles for a reason,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   because this is an indirect or direct indictment against Israel.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   If God created a nation of Israel to be a blessing to them,
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.760]   and that they would be a blessing to the rest of the nations,
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   if the Messiah that they've been waiting for
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.760]   for hundreds of years shows up,
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   you would think that maybe that they would maybe have
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   a representative of each tribe,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   maybe a top scholar of each tribe represented in the Twelve.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   But the first thing that we see, there's none of that.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   And again, this is a direct or indirect judgment
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   against a nation of Israel, that he bypasses all of these things,
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   and there's no scribe.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   Scribes are the scholars.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   These guys are the PhDs in theology.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.760]   There's no rabbi.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.760]   There's no teacher, even in a smaller scale.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   There's no synagogue leader.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   There's nobody of any prominence.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.760]   There's no Pharisee,
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   who was known to be a meticulous keeper of the law.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   There's not one prominent person.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   The only information that we do know of some of the disciples
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   are just that they were fishermen,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.760]   or something negative.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   They were tax collectors.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.760]   These are people who would have been hated by Israel.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.760]   And outside of that, all the other information about the other disciples,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.760]   we know nothing about because they were, by human terms, a nobody.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   So the first thing that we recognize is that these people
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.760]   were of no prominence.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   It's just like saying today,
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   if Christ came and he was to do a round two
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   on establishing a church
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   and to fulfill his promise,
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   there's no pastor.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   There's no elder.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   There's no professor.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   There's no celebrity.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   No CEOs.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   No Ivy League graduates.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   Nobody who has any kind of connection.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.760]   Nobody wealthy.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.760]   Just plain people that no one would have known.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.760]   That's basically equivalent of what he did.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.760]   He took 12 people
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   who was either nobody that anybody knew,
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   or even negative.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   Why would you choose them?
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   And people began to question.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.760]   How can that be the Messiah if he chooses people like them?
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   Our Messiah would never do that.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   You would think that there would be some Pharisees.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.760]   There would be some scribes.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   Some leaders.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.760]   Somebody of prominence.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   But nothing.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   It was not by accident.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   It was very deliberate.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   God deliberately chose those people with no prominence
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   because of what he was intending to do in them
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.760]   and through them.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   If you know the book of Corinthians,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.760]   the first letter and the second letter
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.760]   was probably the harshest and the most critical letter
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   that he wrote to the churches.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   The first letter that he writes,
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   he begins by saying that this church is divided
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   because they were trying to one-up each other.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   Who's the most spiritual?
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   Who's the closest to God?
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   So they were comparing.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   He said, "No, we follow Peter because he was the first apostle.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   He's the apostle among apostles.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   We follow Paul because he's the apostle to the Gentiles
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   and they're in the Gentile area."
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   Some of the saying they follow somebody else or Jesus.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   And he says, "All the problems that you are having
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   is because you have forgotten who you are."
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   And so he's writing an indictment in 1 Corinthians 2.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   He says, "For consider your calling, brethren,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   that there were not many wise according to the flesh,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.760]   not many mighty, not many noble,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.760]   but God has chosen the foolish things of the world
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.760]   to shame the wise and God has chosen the weak things
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   of the world to shame the things which are strong
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   and the base things of the world
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   and despised God has chosen the things that are not
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   so that he may nullify the things that are
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   so that no man may boast before God."
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   And if you were paying attention closely, right,
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   I mean, this is a slap in the face
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   because they were all fighting to see
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.760]   who has better honor, who should get better honor,
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   who should have more say in this church.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   And then he says, "Not many of you were wise."
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   In other words, you were foolish, right?
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   So if they're paying attention carefully, right?
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   Did he just say what he said?
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.760]   He just called us all a bunch of fools.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   He said, "Not many of you," right,
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.760]   "God has chosen the weak," right?
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.760]   He said, "Wait, wait, wait."
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.760]   He said, "He just called us fools."
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   And he said, "We're weak."
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.760]   And then he said he chose the base things, right?
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   Base meaning like there's nothing prominent,
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   there's nothing special about you, right?
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.760]   That's you.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.760]   He's talking to these people who are fighting
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   to see who's going to have the upper hand.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   You're base, you're nothing.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   God deliberately chose you because you had nothing,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   because you are a nobody, because you are a fool.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   So if they were paying attention,
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   "Wait, wait, wait, wait."
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   He just called us nobody, nothing, weak,
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   bunch of fools, all of that intentionally
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   to nullify the system of this world.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   In order to slap the face of the system of this world,
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   he deliberately chose those who are weak.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   That's what it says in James 2 verse 5.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   "Listen, my beloved brethren,
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   did not God choose the poor of this world
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   which he promised to those who love him?"
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   He deliberately chose people who weren't in the system.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   He went outside the system as an indictment
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   against the religious system of that time.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   You know, you can tell when somebody
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   immigrated to the United States, right?
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   Some of you are born and raised here,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   so you may not have much of an accent
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   or at least you don't think you do, right?
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   But if you came later, the later you came,
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   the more of an accent you're going to have, right?
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   Because you have the old way of thinking
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.760]   and accents that you picked up when you were young
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   and then tried to get a new way of saying things
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   and so you're adding on top of what you know,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   the new accent.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.760]   So the older, the longer you stayed in one culture,
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   the more difficult it is to get rid of that, right?
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   So you could tell, but if you came when you were young,
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.760]   right, if you came like two, three, four, five,
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.760]   you probably even forgot your previous language
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760]   if you immigrated here, right?
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   In the same way, God chooses the people
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.760]   who are not in the system
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   because he was trying to teach them
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.760]   a completely new system
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   to get rid of the old ways, to teach a Pharisee
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   the things that he was trying to teach the disciples.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.760]   You have to get these guys from on high
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   who spent years climbing up this religious system.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   These years, years of these scribes
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   are learning the way of the Pharisees
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   and the way that things were
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   and Jesus came and he had to tear it all down
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   in order to bring about his kingdom.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.760]   And in order to do that, he started fresh
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   with people who were already base,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   who were nullified, who were foolish.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   You know, you guys remember not that long ago, right,
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   we had Olympics and the supposed, you know,
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.760]   the top basketball team with LeBron James
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   and Steph Curry and all the superstars of the NBA,
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   you know, put a team together
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   and just assumed that they were going to demolish everybody
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   and then before the Olympics started,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   they had a pre-Olympic, right, game
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   with South Sudanese
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.760]   and they almost lost until the very last second.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.760]   LeBron James came and he put up a layup
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.760]   and then he was able to win the game,
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.760]   but he made the news because it was the South Sudanese
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   because they were supposed to crush them.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   And the reason why they made the news
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.760]   is because South Sudanese have only existed for 11 years.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.760]   It's a brand new country.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   11 years ago, every single one of these guys
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   were refugees as a child.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   They grew up in a refugee camp
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.760]   and in South Sudan,
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   they don't even have an indoor basketball court.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   So all their training happened on the outside.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   They grew up just playing basketball outside, right,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   like our BBA.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760]   You know, I hear all the time, "It's not good for my knees,"
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.760]   you know what I mean, "playing outside."
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   You guys are so spoiled.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   Even our BBA, people complain
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   that we need to play on the soft floor.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.760]   These guys came out to the Olympics
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   and they don't have indoor basketball courts
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   and they almost beat the superstars of the world.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.760]   Now, we heard it for a little while,
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   but can you imagine if these guys actually beat them,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.760]   come to the Olympics, and they win the gold medal?
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   Imagine what would have happened.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   The buzz around, the news that would have come out.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   What was it about these guys?
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.760]   They would have examined their clothing.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.760]   They would have examined their food.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   They would have examined their genetics.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   What was it about these guys?
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.760]   And they would have examined their training.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   Everything about them.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   How can these guys, who don't even have indoor basketball,
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   who were refugees just 11 years ago,
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   beat these multi-millionaires?
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   LeBron James spends a million dollars
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.760]   just taking care of his body,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   and how can these guys beat them?
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   That's exactly what happened with the disciples.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   These 12 guys who had no training, no background,
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   all of a sudden, they flipped the world upside down.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   Completely flipped the world upside down.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.760]   He chose 12 people for what he's been preparing
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.760]   for thousands of years.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   12 people, untrained, have no background,
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   nobody that wealthy, nobody that connected.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   He chose them.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   How could they have happened?
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   If you typically hear a secular or liberal New Testament scholar
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   or somebody who's just kind of superficially dismissing Christianity,
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   they'll look at it and say, "Well, that happened
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   because they were connected, they were Roman citizens,
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   people were poor, and it created this perfect storm,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.760]   and that's why they were able to do all this stuff."
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.760]   But if you examine carefully, all of that is nonsense.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   Christianity, according to human wisdom,
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   should have died the first century.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   With the persecution, they're being slaughtered
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   for saying that Christ resurrected from the dead,
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   and they were willing?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   They were willing to give their lives?
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   The only thing that could explain how these 12 men
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   turned the world upside down
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   was because God was with them.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   Period.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   Period.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   And that's exactly what we see here.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   Even the choice of these 12 men tells us
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   that God is going against all the conventional wisdom
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   of this world.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   And he does that very deliberately.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   He said he chose those who are nothing
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   to nullify those who are.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   He chose the foolish to nullify those we think are wise.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   He chose people who have no prominence
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.760]   in order to nullify those people
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   who are proud because of their prominence.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.760]   You know what it says?
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   Well, then, what power?
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   How were they equipped?
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.760]   Was it three years of classroom training,
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   the techniques, and, you know,
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   how to use the Aristotle argument
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   of convincing somebody?
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.760]   Did they learn the latest marketing technique
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   and the new branding?
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   All it tells us is Luke chapter 1.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   He called the 12 together and gave them power
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   and authority over all the demons
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   and to heal diseases.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   It was given to them.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   He just gave it to them.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   It didn't say years of training,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   how to manipulate the power,
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   don't lay hands here, lay it on here.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   When you talk to the demons, talk to them this way.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   It's like, no, he just gave it to them.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   And because he gave them the power,
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   he gave them the authority,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.760]   they were able to do what Jesus was doing.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.760]   And it was simply given to them.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   It wasn't years of training.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   What was he exactly teaching them to do?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.760]   In our generation,
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   where does authority and power come from?
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   Depending on what stage of life you're in, right?
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   If you're in elementary school,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.760]   your authority and power, you think,
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   comes from your parents.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   So when you're in elementary school,
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.760]   the cool kids are the ones who have parents
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   who are wealthy or they're celebrities
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   or they're known and what car, what house they live.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   And then when you go to high school,
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   it's your looks, which friend group you're in,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   how athletic you are.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   And those are the cool kids
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   that everybody is trying to think that
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   my life would be better if I'm part of that group.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   If you're in college, you start to compare,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.760]   well, what school did you get into?
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.760]   Where did you, where, what are you studying?
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   What major are you in?
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   And that's where we think life is going to be.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.760]   The next stage is, where do you work?
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   Do I work at Google or I work this or I work that?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.760]   And so that's where the next stage comes from.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   Next stage is, will you get married?
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.760]   Who did you get married to?
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   And then after that is, how successful were you?
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.760]   And that's the struggle.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   Those of you who are in your 30s and 40s,
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   that's the stage that you're in,
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   where you've gone through the schools,
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   you've had your job,
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   but how successful are you in your job?
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   And then the next stage in your 50s are your kids.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   What school are your kids in?
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   What are they doing?
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   And so this rat race gets us going all throughout our life,
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   different stages that we have,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.760]   where that's where we think power and authority comes from.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   But does that type of thinking,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.760]   do those principles stop at the church door?
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.760]   Do we nullify that and say when we come to the church
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.760]   that we work through a completely different set of standards
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   of where we get the power and authority?
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.760]   If we're not careful, we do the same thing in the church.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   If you have a large church, if you have a PhD,
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   if you have experience, if you're gifted,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   you must be closer to God.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   And so we try to present the church in a way
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   where it completely nullifies who God is.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   So when a church is successful, what do we do?
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   So who's the pastor?
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   Well, how is his preaching?
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   How is the church organized?
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   What kind of funding do they have?
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   What's their building like?
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   What's their location?
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.760]   What's the makeup of the people?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   And so we examine everything that human beings are able to do,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   and then we try to repeat that in the next church,
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   because if we repeat that,
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   maybe we'll have the same success that they did,
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.760]   and by doing so, we nullify the power of God.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   He does this very deliberately to nullify the things that are.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.760]   To nullify the things that are.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.760]   Power and authority was simply given to them.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   So when the disciples, after the resurrection of Christ,
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.760]   began to go and preach the gospel, people were amazed.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   What is it about them?
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   Just like the South Sudanese,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   what is it about these guys that they're willing to give their lives?
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   Where did they get their boldness?
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   And at the end of examination, they said they realized that they were with Jesus.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   That's all.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   That's the only conclusion they came to.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   It's like, oh, they must have been trained properly.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   They went to the right school.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   They had the right scholars around them.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   All they can come up with is why they were able to speak with such power and authority,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:08.760]   is that they came back and they said they realized that they were with Jesus.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   Ephesians chapter 2, 8-9, it says,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourself.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   It is a gift of God, not as a result of their works,
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.760]   so that no one may boast."
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   That's the point.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   That's the point of the gospel.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Salvation by grace alone.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.760]   "So that no one may boast."
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   To humble us.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   Because what ruins us more than anything else is our own pride.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   Our own desire in this rat race to get ahead.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   That's how Satan fell.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   Because he saw the glory of God and said, "I want some of that."
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   And that's how he tempts us.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   He said, "If you eat of this, you will have what God has."
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   And so all throughout the fallenness of man,
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   the temptation is for us to get ahead in life.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.760]   It is our pride.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.760]   It is our pride. It is our flesh that the world tempts us with.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   It is at the core of the fallen nature of man.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   It is wanting for us to get to the next stage.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   And have a better life.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   Because we think that's where power comes from.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   Jesus does exactly the opposite to nullify their power.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.760]   In 2 Corinthians 12, 7-10, it says,
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.760]   "Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelation for this reason,
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   to keep me from exalting myself."
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   Apostle Paul, this is a text that you know very well,
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   where he's begging God, he says,
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   "Three times he asked the Lord to take the thorn from his side."
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   He said, "Concerning this, I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me."
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   It might leave me.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   The reason why he mentions three times is because that's how agonizing it was.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   Number three is the number of confirmation.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   This is how much he was suffering.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   And he begged the Lord to take this off my side.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.760]   Now, we don't know exactly what that is.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   But some people think that maybe he was sick.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   And he needed to be healed.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   And some people have different ideas.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   And some people think that maybe it was his wife,
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   because he's talking about his side.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   Right?
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   Adam took the bone from his side, so that must be his wife nagging him.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   It's like, "Please, Lord, deliver me from my wife."
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   Some scholars believe that he may have been married in the beginning,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   and then because his wife couldn't understand how this man,
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.760]   who was so prominent, a Roman citizen, a disciple of Gamaliel,
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   how could he have turned and he's going to village and beat up,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   and she just left him.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   So this is not a proven fact,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   but some scholars believe that that's what happened to him,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   and so they think that maybe this was his wife.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   I think that it was his detractors, considering the context,
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   because later on he says, "In weakness," he says,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   "Therefore I am well content with weakness, with insults, distresses, persecutions, difficulties,"
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   and every single one of these is talking about another human being
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   who's making it hard for him.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   And in the context, that's exactly what he says.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   In 2 Corinthians, he writes about how people were questioning his apostleship,
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   and he says his credential of apostleship is his suffering.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   So I believe that his detractors were questioning him constantly.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.760]   And here's a guy who was being beaten, stoned, dragged out for dead,
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   and people are saying, "This guy's only doing it for money."
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.760]   I think it bothered him so much that he begged the Lord to please take it away,
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   but Jesus' response to him was says,
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   "Concerning this, I implored the Lord to leave three times,
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:54.760]   and he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.'"
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   You would think if you chose an apostle to go and represent you to the Gentile world
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   that you would provide the funds, that you would provide the safety,
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   you would provide the health, that you would provide everything that he needs
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   so all he has to do is stand up on a pulpit and preach the Word of God.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   But that's not what happens to him.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   He's a rich, connected man, a Roman citizen, already well-known even by kings.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   He's making tents to pay for bills.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   And he says he deliberately allowed a messenger of Satan to bother him to the point
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   where he's begging God three times to take it away.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   And he says the whole reason why God allowed it is to humble him
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   because it is our own pride.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:49.760]   The biggest hindrance for the work of God to work is our own pride.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.760]   When we are rich, he becomes poor.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   When we are powerful, he's presented as weak.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   It is our own pride, our own know-how, it is our own talent,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   it is our own view of ourselves that gets in the way of God being revealed.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.760]   That's why he chose the twelve.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   The worst thing that a man of God can do is to touch his glory,
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   is to take some credit.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   He gave them this power.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   He simply gave them the power.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   2 Corinthians 12 tells us, "The signs of true apostles were performed among you
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   with all perseverance by signs and wonders and miracles."
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   Today, we use the word "apostle" as somebody who's elevated, who's chosen, who's unique.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   That God gave them power, which is all true,
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   but the word "apostle" simply means a messenger.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   A messenger, a servant, that's all it means.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   It became elevated because of what God used them for,
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   but the actual word simply means a servant
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   who just went and heard what God had to say
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   and then went and told them what he said.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   That's all that word means.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   God gave them the power.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   We have a tendency to allow the secular thinking to penetrate into the church
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   and thinking that if we follow these principles, that our church will succeed.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   And I remember when the Seeker Friendly Movement was coming in,
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:32.760]   we spent a whole class time talking about how Coca-Cola brands their drink.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   And this is back in 1989, 1990.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   And I remember sitting there thinking, "This is interesting. I've never heard this before."
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   But the whole class was about how Coca-Cola, how everybody drinks Coca-Cola,
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   how so many billions of people drink Coca-Cola.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   And if the church wants to be successful,
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   we need to learn how to brand the gospel and Christianity.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   And I remember one older lady in the room,
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   and we were just thinking, "That's interesting. It's interesting."
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   And one lady, an older lady, I think who's been walking with the Lord much longer than us,
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   she said, "This sounds like manipulation."
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   And I remember half the class, when she said that, like,
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   "Yeah, this does sound like manipulation.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   So we're going to manipulate people into the kingdom of God?"
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   And I remember all of a sudden, just a snap of fingers, like,
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   "This is not it. This is not from God."
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   I remember for years, you know, early church,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   I'm trying to figure out, like, how are you supposed to do church?
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   I love God. I believe in the Bible.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   But I've never been a pastor before.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   I don't know what you're supposed to do in a church.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   So I got all the church growth books that I can get.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   And I remember reading in those books,
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   and one of the things that they said was,
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   "You need to have a critical mass of 30 people."
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   They said, "Don't start a church unless there's at least 30 people that you have a group."
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   Because all the churches that have ever grown has a critical mass of 30 people.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   And then if you read further on, it'll say that you can't give sermons more than 30 minutes
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.760]   because people are used to 30-minute sitcoms, and this is back then.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   Now it's 14-second TikTok, so your sermon can't be more than 14 seconds, right?
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   And that's what they said.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   30-minute sermon with an illustration every 5 minutes,
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   because that's where the commercials come on, right?
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   The bathrooms have to be clean, right?
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   Or else they're not going to come back,
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:30.760]   because the reason why McDonald's is so successful is because their bathrooms are immaculate.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   So they were using all this human wisdom,
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   and one of the things that they said is, "The parking can't be too far,"
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   which our church is failing in right now.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.760]   Some of you were shuttled here.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   How did you come? Why did you come?
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   So the more I read, the more I began to realize,
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   what does this have to do with God?
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   The success of the church is based upon marketing techniques of McDonald's and Coca-Cola.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:10.760]   This goes directly against everything that God was trying to teach his disciples.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:15.760]   He tells them, he says, he chooses people that have no prominence,
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.760]   so that if anything happened, it would be like the South Sudanese.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   How were they able to, so we would examine closely and realize their proximity to Christ?
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   And that's it.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   That's the only thing that we can look at, is because God empowered them.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   Their power did not come from education, their background, their know-how, or their talent, or their experience,
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   or their vast training, vast education.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   No, God's power, Jesus' power was given to them.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   1 Samuel 16, 7, when God chooses David, it says,
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look at his appearance or at the height.'"
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   Every time I read this, that height thing always stands out to me.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   "Don't look at their height."
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   It's a personal joke, if you get it.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   "Because I have rejected him, for God sees not as man sees,
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.760]   for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   I don't know how many sermons I've heard where a pastor said,
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   "The reason God chose David was because David was in the background training to be a..."
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   What is this?
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   What is this? I forgot.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   Huh?
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   Slingshot, slingshot.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.760]   I should write this down. I keep forgetting.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.760]   Because he was in the background for years practicing his slingshot, he got so good at it,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   he knew that if he chose David and Goliath came,
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   that he was the only one that was going to be able to throw that rock and hit it perfectly on his head,
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.760]   and then he would die.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.760]   So if you want to be used powerfully by God,
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   you make sure that you sharpen your slingshot skills.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   And when you are ready, and you have something to offer God,
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   and you have enough connections, and you have enough authority, and you have enough power,
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   then God is going to choose you because he needs you for his kingdom.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   Utter garbage.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   The only reason why David was chosen, because it says, it tells us,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   because he was a man after God's own heart. That's why.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   But we have a tendency to look, just like it says in Romans chapter 1,
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   that we have a tendency to make images of ourselves and worship it.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   We can't copy God's power, but we can copy David's.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   We can't copy his authority, but we can copy the pastor down the street.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   And so we have a tendency to focus our energy on the things that you and I are capable of doing.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   But what God did was completely supernatural.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   It was completely supernatural.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   He did only what he is capable of doing.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   For what reason?
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.760]   So that no one may boast.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   Because it is our boasting that ruins us.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.760]   It is our pride that prevents us from experiencing and knowing his power.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   In fact, he says, he tells them, "Don't take anything."
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   I mean, think about it every time, even when we go on a trip.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   What kind of, how big the bag, right?
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.760]   What do I need to take? What's the weather?
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   Is it cool? Is it hot? Is it cold? What do I need to take?
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   What kind of shoes do I need to get?
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   How much should I take? What do I need?
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.760]   If I go there, where's the hotel? How far is it?
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   What's the transportation like?
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   Especially if you have a small child, think about all the planning that goes in so that you can be equipped and ready.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   And even when you do all of that, it's never as comfortable as when you're home.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.760]   Jesus is sending them to preach about the kingdom, that people are going to be hostile.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.760]   And then he says, in verse 3, "Take nothing for your journey."
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.760]   Nothing.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   And then he explains, "Neither a staff."
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.760]   What was a staff?
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.760]   Like today, if we're going from here to LA, you're not worried about wild animals.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.760]   People jump in you, right?
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   Not in your car.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.760]   But at that time, if you're walking, you need a staff.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   What if there's a wolf up on the top?
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.760]   I shared this years ago when I asked the pastors in India,
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   "What's the most difficult thing you ever faced in evangelizing?"
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.760]   And I was expecting rocks and stones and knives.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.760]   And he said it was a tiger.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.760]   So they were walking in the field trying to get to a remote village.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.760]   And they saw a tiger walking down, and then they freaked out.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   And then they were hiding behind the boulder.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.760]   And then they said the tiger ended up making a left turn and then just disappeared.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   And they just said, "Yeah, probably a tiger."
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   Imagine these guys being sent out.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   The staff was there for protection, the wolves, whatever wild animals might be there.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   And he said, "Don't take that."
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   He says, "Don't take a bag."
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   Nothing.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.760]   What if we want to take rocks?
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   Maybe the staff is not going to work.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   But if we want to take rocks or something, don't take that.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   Don't take bread.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   I mean, today, everywhere we go, we have to figure out how we're going to eat.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   We can't go there.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   What are we going to eat?
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   He said, "Don't even take bread."
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   It's not like they can go and find restaurants or they can find someone's place.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.760]   If you don't have bread with you, you're not going to eat.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.760]   And then on top of that, he says, "Don't take any money."
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   Well, if you don't have bread, at least if you have some money,
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   you can go and ask people and say, "Hey, can I give you some money?
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   Whatever you're eating for dinner, can I have some of that?"
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   He says, "No, don't even take money."
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   He says, "Do not even take two tunics."
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   Tunic was the most basic outfit.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.760]   So it would be equivalent to a T-shirt.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   He says, "Don't even take more than one T-shirt.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.760]   Only take exactly what you need to breathe and live."
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   That's it.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   Now, why does he do that?
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   To torture them so he can come back and hear about how cold it was
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   and where they got bit?
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.760]   No.
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   Every part of that was what was he teaching them, to trust me.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.760]   He said, "Well, what if we get bit?"
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   "Well, God intended for you to get bit then."
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760]   "What if we starve?"
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   "God intended for you to starve then."
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:18.760]   There's one single thing that we see repeated over and over and over
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   all throughout the Old Testament, all throughout the New Testament,
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.760]   is to trust me.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.760]   Do not turn from the word to the left or to the right,
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.760]   whether it is in season or out of season.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   Do not add or do not take away.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   Just do exactly as I say.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   That's what he told them when they were marching in the desert.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   Lift up that box.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760]   But don't just anybody lift it up, only these people lift it up.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   When they lift it up, they need to use the poles.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.760]   He called it at the end, "Get in line, march.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   When I tell you to stop, you stop.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   When I tell you to get up, get up.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.760]   And then you camp out this way.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   Make sure the tribes are set up equal distance from each other.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.760]   Nobody comes."
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   He gave them meticulous.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.760]   And he said, "Do exactly as I say if you want to be successful.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   When I tell you to hold the staff up, hold it up.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.760]   When I tell you to put it down, you put it down."
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760]   Because it is not our power.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.760]   It is not our know-how.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   It is not our wisdom.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760]   It is not our talent.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   It is not our resources.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   All of those things get in the way of God doing his work.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   He simply gave them.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   He simply gave them the power.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   And the only requirement for David was that he loved the Lord.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   He loved the Lord.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.760]   All the commandments, the greatest commandments,
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength."
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   Doesn't that simplify Christianity?
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   Doesn't that simplify the church?
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.760]   Doesn't that simplify everything that we're doing, discipleship?
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.760]   Do not take anything.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:06.760]   And all he told them to do was to pray, pray, pray.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   So when God works, then you know God did it.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.760]   We have a tendency, as soon as we bear fruit, it's like, "What did you do?
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760]   What was your program?
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.760]   How did you organize?
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   What is your training like?
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760]   Oh, you guys have such a great training.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   You have great this, great that."
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:30.760]   He deliberately did what he did to nullify, nullify.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   Today, the modern Western church is an example of everything that man can throw at it
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   and what it results.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.760]   I'm talking specifically the Western church.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:56.760]   I don't think even the West can argue that we are spiritually weaker than the previous generation,
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   that we are spiritually weaker than the churches in China.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   We are much spiritually weaker than the churches in India.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:12.760]   And yet, we have more money than church has ever seen in human history.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   I heard of this one church that has $100 million just put in the bank account just in case North Korea opens up.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   I had a friend who was in charge of a mission program in this one mega church,
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   and his budget was $10 million.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   We have more money as Christians than the church has ever experienced in 2,000 years in the Western church.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.760]   We have more freedom.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:46.760]   We have more freedom than 99.99% of any Christian who has ever lived in history.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   In history, we have more freedom.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:54.760]   There's people who are living in areas where just simply by owning a Bible, they can be executed.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.760]   But you and I, we can travel, we can preach.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.760]   I mean, they might get annoyed.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   They don't like it.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760]   "Hey, shut up!"
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   "Oh, I'm being persecuted today."
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   That's the degree of persecution we have, at least.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   And I'm not saying that we shouldn't fight.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   We live in a free country.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   We should speak to change laws and choose the right people in office.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.760]   We should do all of that.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   But we have more freedom.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   Let's understand this in proper perspective.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:29.760]   We have more freedom now than the church has ever experienced in church history.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   We have more education, more seminaries.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   You can go online if you don't want to physically drive.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   If physically driving is just too hard for you, you can get online and push a button.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.760]   And top-notch professors around the world are popping up on your screen whenever you want.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   We have more education, more seminaries, more training, more books than the church has ever experienced in church history.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   When we go to certain parts of the world and we say they need a Bible, nobody ever asks, "Which version do you want?"
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   That's a luxury that only you and I have.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.760]   Oh, LSB, NASB, the NIV, the RSB, the King James.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   How about the new King James?
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   How about the Ebonics?
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   We have more translations than the church has ever seen.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   More access.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.760]   We have Bible programs.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.760]   Books you can read.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   More training.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:32.760]   I don't know any church in our generation that has gotten more training than we have.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:38.760]   Training for marriage, training for evangelism, training for small group, training to cling.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.760]   I mean, we have more training than they've ever had in church history.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   We have more opportunities than ever.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   I remember just even in 1993 when we were doing a vision trip to China years ago.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   I took $50 because that's, you know, at that time that was a lot of money.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.760]   It took me $25 to call back home for like a four-minute conversation with my wife.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.760]   And I said, "I can't call you anymore."
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   For 30 days I made contact with her one time.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   And I remember, you know, back in the '70s and even parts of '80s when missionaries left,
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.760]   we said goodbye to them at the pier or at the port.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.760]   Because most of them got on a boat and they left.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   When they left, that was it.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   You're not going to see them again because it's too hard to get back.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   But now, I mean, you're on the Facebook, "What's up? It's 3 a.m. today."
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.760]   But I'm just saying that we have more opportunities than we've ever had in church history.
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.760]   Things have become much more easier, much more convenient.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.760]   We have more access to education, more access to sermon.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   And this is the spiritual state that we're in.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   We envy the church in India. We envy the church in North Korea.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   We envy the church in China that under heavy persecution when they have nothing
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   or they have to think twice about even gathering or they might be put into jail.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   And yet, the power of God is so evident in those churches.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.760]   There's something backward in the way that we're thinking.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.760]   We've allowed the principles of this world that Jesus tried so hard to eradicate from the church.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:23.760]   We've allowed it to creep back into the church thinking that somehow if we work harder,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   if we're trained better, if we have better education,
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.760]   if we have the right people in charge, that we can be successful.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   Success is from him. Power and authority is from him and him alone.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.760]   In Psalm 127, verse 1 and 2, it says, "Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   It is in vain for you to rise up early, to retire late, to eat the bread of painful labors,
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.760]   for he gives to his beloved even in his sleep."
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:04.760]   Remember, whenever we get tempted to think that only if we had more of this and more of that,
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   God chose one man to build Israel.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:14.760]   God chose one judge to deliver his people during the time of judges.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.760]   He chose one prophet to deliver his message.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   He chose a few men to turn the world upside down.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   Few men for the purpose of the world.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:30.760]   He chose one man, Apostle Paul, as an apostle to the Gentiles.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   You know, one of the most common questions that I get is,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   "We have four pastors, and we're going to have three, and so don't we need more people?"
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.760]   Of course! Right?
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   We can use a hundred.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   We can use a hundred people.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   The harvest is plentiful, workers are few.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.760]   So we're always beseeching the Lord of the harvest to send out more workers.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   But the greatest need is not man.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.760]   The greatest need is not more pastors.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   I'm not anxious because we lack manpower.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.760]   What makes me anxious is that we lack God's power.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   What makes me anxious is that we don't pray enough.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.760]   That we're not humbled enough.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.760]   That we're not desperate enough.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.760]   God does not lack men.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.760]   God does not lack training.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.760]   God does not lack resources.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   What he is waiting for are men and women of faith.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   Men and women of faith.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.760]   One man.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.760]   One man with the authority and the power of God.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.760]   Room filled with people who are surrendered to God.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.760]   You don't need a hundred people.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.760]   You don't need five.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.760]   Because it's easy.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.760]   It's easy to disciple people who are in love with Christ.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.760]   Who are surrendered to Christ.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   Because all I have to do is show you what the Word of God says.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.760]   All I have to do is tell you what it says.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.760]   And you will hear his voice.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.760]   You know, now that our church is a little bit bigger,
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   I've heard people say, "Oh, you should write about your experiences
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   "in ministry and people will benefit and all that stuff."
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.760]   And I said, "Everything that I would say is already here.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   "It's already here."
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   And there's people who are much more articulate, much more educated,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   much more experienced than I.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.760]   They've already written it.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   But everything that you need to know is already here.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   It's already in the Bible.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   What we lack is not training.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.760]   Those things are things that we wrestle with after we've prayed.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   Those things that we endeavor and establish
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.760]   after we are confident that we have come before the Lord
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   desperately pleading and asking for his power.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760]   Then we can worry about discipleship.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.760]   Then we can worry about training.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   Then we can worry about the content of the church.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   But until we have surrendered all that we have for his power,
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   everything else will actually work against us.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   It is when we are weak, he is strong.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.760]   It is when we are weak, when he is strong.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.760]   It is when we are weak is when we pray.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   We need to recognize how weak we are
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   so that we would recognize how desperate we are.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.760]   And it is in our desperation the Holy Spirit will lead us to pray.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.760]   If there's anything central to the training of the disciples
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   that Jesus repeated over and over again,
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:57.760]   you cannot bear fruit until you abide in me.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   Let's pray.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:14.760]   Father, help us to know this wisdom, this warning, this equipping
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.760]   that's scattered all throughout the Bible.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.760]   Help us, Lord, God, not to follow the pattern of this world,
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   but be transformed by the renewing of our mind
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   that all the things that we have been trained and taught to do
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.760]   in this fallen world, help us to renew all of that,
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   to be like children, to simply to obey, to listen,
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   and to follow, and to trust that it is in our weakness
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.760]   that you would demonstrate your power.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.760]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   [music]
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   My waking breath, for my daily breath,
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   I depend on You, I depend on You,
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:42.760]   for the sun to rise, for my sleep at night.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:52.760]   I depend on You, I depend on You.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.760]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:07.760]   I'm the branch and You are the vine.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:18.760]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:31.760]   Where the Spirit lives, as I follow You.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:40.760]   I depend on You, I depend on You,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:51.760]   for the victory's still in front of me.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:15:01.760]   I depend on You, I depend on You.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.760]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.760]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.760]   I'm the branch and You are the vine.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.760]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.760]   Be my hope, my treasure, my pride.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.760]   I am Yours forever, You're mine.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:16:00.760]   When I pass through death, as I enter rest,
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:09.760]   I depend on You, I depend on You,
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:19.760]   for eternal life to be raised with Christ.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   I depend on You, oh, I depend on You.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.760]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.760]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.760]   I'm the branch and You are the vine.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:59.760]   Be my hope, my treasure, my pride.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   I am Yours forever, You're mine.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.760]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.760]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.760]   Be my hope, my treasure, my pride.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.760]   I am Yours forever, You're mine.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.760]   Let's pray.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.760]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.760]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.760]   and the eternal love of God the Father,
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.760]   rest, restore, strengthen, and empower us
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.760]   that we may be the aroma of Christ
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   wherever You send us, amen.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.760]   God sent His Son.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.760]   They called Him Jesus.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.760]   He came to love.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   He went forth in.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.760]   He lived and died
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.760]   to buy my pardon.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   the Savior lives
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   because He lives.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   I can face tomorrow
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.760]   because He lives.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.760]   All fear is gone
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   because I know
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.760]   He holds the future.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.760]   And life is worth the living
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   just because He lives.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   In desperation
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   I turned to heaven
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.760]   and spoke Your name into the night.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.760]   Then through the darkness
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   Your loving kindness...
