[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.960]   Hello everyone, welcome to another session of our Bible study. This is week 15 of our
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.360]   Ephesians study. Just want to make mention of the fact that next week is week 16, which
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.840]   is the end of chapter 4, and then afterwards we're going to be taking a one-week break,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160]   and then we're going to be jumping right back into the book of Ephesians to finish the second
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.240]   half as a condensed special summer session of Ephesians. And we'll go week to week studying
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.120]   the passage. So as just a quick heads up to the schedule, please know that next week is
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.440]   another session finishing off chapter 4, and then again we'll take a quick breather and
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.280]   start back up again. Let's take a moment to pray as we jump into our study for tonight.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.320]   Lord, we want to thank you, God. Lord, it is our prayer that God we would be more like
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   you. God, it is our desire, our growing desire, that the more we learn about you, we recognize
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.640]   how glorious, how holy, righteous, all the descriptions, Father God, of who you are,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.840]   are all of the more attractive and more beautiful in our sight. And it is our prayer that we,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.180]   as those who have been adopted as your children, sons and daughters, God, that we would reflect
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.880]   our heavenly Father. And to this end, God, I pray that we would hear your exhortation,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.920]   we would hear your word, and all the more have the spiritual conviction, God, that we
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   must change, that we must change as individuals who are being formed to the image of Christ.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.240]   And God, that we are following after you. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:57.080]   Okay, I'd like to begin off with a review just to draw the thoughts up until this portion.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.760]   We've been learning a lot. And one of the things that we have been learning is that
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.600]   by the ramification of what Christ has done for us individually, we together are one.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.200]   Remember that scripture talked about we are becoming one body, right? What's more, at
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.080]   the beginning of this chapter, there was such a description of, listen, we have one faith,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   one baptism, one spirit, one Lord, right? And so it emphasized such a oneness for every
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.400]   believer that is in Christ. At the same time, the scriptures emphasize our individuality.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.360]   And the passage of the scriptures right before or earlier in this chapter talked about how
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.240]   to each of us, Christ has given gifts. And what's more, within that same context, says
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   Christ has given gifts to the church to minister the scriptures. So we learned about how Christ
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.400]   says he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors and teachers,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.520]   right? And he talked about how he did all this with the desire and a vision so that
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.560]   we would grow to the stature of Christ. He's talking about our own maturity. That when
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.880]   you think about the growth of the church, we have to be thinking on the spiritual level.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.120]   We have to be growing in unity. We have to be growing in like-mindedness according to
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   the word of God and so forth. But what's more, the vision of God for the church would be
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.720]   that every single one of us be equipped, be matured in such a way that we are involved
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.000]   in ministry, okay? That we are the ones taking hold of serving all this for the purpose of
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.640]   the building up of the body, that the church would build itself up in love. Okay? That's
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.440]   where we left off in the previous section. And then so it's not so separate, but that
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.720]   moves on that all of these thoughts then contribute to these next verses that we were going to
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.680]   be studying tonight. So reminding us that the vision of God that he has for the church
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.760]   is comprised of these kinds of things that we're responsible for. We have this passage.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.840]   It says, "So this I say and affirm together with the Lord that you walk no longer as the
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.600]   Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.680]   excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.000]   hardness of their heart, that they, having become callous, have given themselves over
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.080]   to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.680]   learn Christ in this way. If indeed you have heard him and have been taught in him, just
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.600]   as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.080]   the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new self, which is in the likeness
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   of God, which sorry, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.440]   holiness of the truth." Okay. What I'd like to do is just take a moment to look at this
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.680]   passage and because it's a little bit long, truthfully, it'd have been nice, I think if
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   I was planning it more closely and thought about this passage to break this up because
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.440]   there's a lot in here. But what I'd like to do then, since it's a little bit of a longer
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.240]   passage, I'd like to outline it for you. And so therefore we're going to read it again.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.640]   And so when we read it again, we recognize distinct portions of this passage that have
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.200]   to be emphasized. And typically it's the command. So verse 17 says, "So this I say and affirm
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.080]   together with the Lord that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk." We should
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.400]   be underlying and underscoring that command that you are to walk no longer as the Gentiles.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.520]   Okay. And if you notice all of the other portions of this passage here in this first section
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.400]   up until the end of verse 19, it is all descriptions of a walk of the Gentiles. Okay. How are the
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.440]   Gentiles like? And so it says that these Gentiles, they walk in the futility of their mind, being
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.120]   darkened in understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.480]   is in them, because of the hardness of their heart. And they, having become callous, have
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.160]   given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:28.520]   So it's clear to see that all of those descriptions have its pointer and an indicator of the walk
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.240]   of the Gentiles. And a second half of it clearly contrasts, but you, okay, you as an individual
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.200]   who is set apart from the Gentiles, you did not learn Christ in this way. If indeed you
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.800]   have heard of him and have been taught in him, just as truth is in Jesus. Notice how
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.360]   I indented that a little bit further because he takes a moment to do a check. He says,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.040]   this is not true of you that you are just like the Gentiles. Rather, you didn't learn
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.520]   Christ in this fashion, right? That's not you. If of course, indeed. And so he does
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.320]   that cross check and then he describes, he describes what it means to not walk like the
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.560]   Gentiles, but rather, okay, the way that we have learned Christ is that we should be able
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   to lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted and the accorded in accordance with
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.280]   the lust of the seat and that you being renewed in the spirit of your mind, put on the new
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.880]   self, which in the likeness of God has been created in Christ in righteousness and holiness
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.720]   of the truth. Okay. So that's a brief outline, how you can separate that passage into two
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.040]   sections. Let's begin by observing that first command. Essentially, he is calling us to
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.960]   cease and desist to stop from walking like the Gentiles. The old life needs to go, right?
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   We know that scripture has described this command in so many different ways. Set yourselves
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.480]   apart. Okay. Do not love the world or the things in the world, right? You're separated
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.440]   from this world. You need a book of Romans chapter six, you need to stop presenting yourself
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.960]   to unrighteousness, but present yourself in holiness and righteousness towards God. So
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.640]   in so many different ways, the scripture has challenged us. Stop looking like the world.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:20.480]   Okay. And recall that at the beginning of chapter four, apostle Paul said, therefore,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.100]   which you have been called with all humility, gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:36.160]   for one another and love being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit and the bond
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.180]   of peace. So apostle Paul, in describing all of the beauties of the gospel and the blessings
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.920]   in Christ, chapter four, he made this strong command that we need to be walking in accordance,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.880]   right? In appropriate accordance with all that the gospel says. And he describes it
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.840]   this way, the negative form of that is stop walking like them anymore. Stop living like
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:05.160]   you still are the exact same. Okay. And so that means that this command expects us to
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.840]   change. It expects us to have that element of transformation that the scriptures talks
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.200]   about in so many different times. That the scriptures expects us to walk with a newness
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.040]   of life. And this should be a regular checkpoint for us. We're the ones who have the responsibility
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:32.300]   to assess ourselves, to examine, am I actually changing? Am I open to change? And I want
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.560]   to talk about this because there are sometimes at different moments in our lives where we
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.960]   are filled with a kind of rebelliousness. We are like children. And sometimes our parents
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.760]   will tell us do this. And we're so resistant, right? Whether it be the outright rebellion
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.560]   of like, Oh, what, what are you going to do about it? Just watch me. Right. And you just
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.160]   so defiant or we turn the tables and like, you can't just tell me to do that. Why? You
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.280]   explain to me why I need to do this. Okay. Why is it so bad that I run with those individuals?
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:12.120]   Why is it so bad that I retain this aspect of my life? Okay. What's more, I think most
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.920]   of us have experienced in some shape or another, the classic blame shifting that existed from
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:27.160]   Adam and Eve, right? Adam and Eve, their natural recourse to being caught was she made me do
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.280]   it, right? The snake made me do it. And everything happened to have a pointing finger. It's like,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.120]   you know what, the way that I was raised, you know what my disposition, you could just
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.800]   blame the universe, you know, the way the universe is, my circumstance, the way you
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   made me God, right? Like that's, that's all part of the blame shifting. But I want to
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:53.280]   take this moment to just focus our attention and just accept the truth that the scriptures
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:01.200]   expect and command us to change. And the thing about it is, it's very simple, obviously very
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.440]   difficult. And we have contrived of every which way to try to dodge it. Now, if I'm
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.400]   speaking to our congregation, just about, you know, I'm very much encouraged that so
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.480]   many people want to grow. And when they say, I want to grow is they're not satisfied with
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.160]   what they see as a matter of fact, through the scriptures, they're in line to the fact
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.680]   that there are many things that need to change. But perhaps some of you are discouraged that
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.200]   change is impossible. That sometimes you look up from trying to live your life as a Christian
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.760]   and you realize I'm still struggling and failing at the very same thing. I want to take a moment
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:46.480]   to just challenge and encourage you that the scriptures desire. When I say scriptures,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:55.160]   God desires us to grow. God wants us to experience greater newness in life. I mean, he's been
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:01.020]   describing to us new motives, new patterns, new resource, new blessings. I mean, everything
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.920]   he's been describing to us, he's been describing all the foundations for change. And I want
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.600]   to encourage you, right? The big portion of hitting a passage like this, where it says
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.680]   put off and put on, right? Put aside the old self is just that acceptance of the reality.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.480]   I have to change. Okay. Moving forward then we ask this question. It may be difficult.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.780]   It may be hard, but what does he actually want us to change? Right? What is the description
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.200]   of the Gentiles? What am I not supposed to do? We should be asking those questions whenever
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.400]   we hit this kind of command, right? No longer walk, no longer just as the Gentiles. Well,
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.320]   there's a big section, several verses on the description of the Gentiles. Here, if you
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.560]   outline it like this, it's kind of like a laundry list. There's many points that which
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.880]   we're not supposed to do, but I saw a certain pattern. And I noticed that there was two
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.260]   main categories of descriptions. And what I mean is if you take a look here in the middle
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:08.000]   of verse 17, it says in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them. And what you
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.520]   notice is that there is a repetition of the foolishness of mind that those who are of
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.480]   the world, this may be really offensive. If this, let's say a non-Christian was listening
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:30.760]   to this, but there is a futility of the way they think, meaning it's empty. It's vanity,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:37.960]   right? There's almost a pointlessness. There is a darkened nature to their understanding
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.520]   and they're excluded from the life of God because there is ignorance, right? Again,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.160]   you see what I'm saying? Like if we dwell on this, like, wow, we, if a non-Christian
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.320]   was to hear this, they would find this quite, quite offensive. But we Christians actually,
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.600]   when we think about our previous life, we are actually saying that was us. As a matter
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.840]   of fact, many times in scriptures, when a godly individual comes to the temple of God
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:13.960]   and sees God, they recognize, oh my goodness, I was just a beast. I was a mindless beast.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.440]   And that's what Asaph says in Psalm chapter 73. You think about, uh, you know, King David
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.760]   when he, when he speaks in Psalm 51, when he's repentant, it's like, I just spoke not
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:32.800]   knowing anything, right? So take a moment to think about this. But when we are thinking
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.200]   outside of God, there is an absolute futility because the perception is small and there
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.640]   is no understanding. An example is if you imagine a family, a father who is so concerned
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.760]   because their finances are looking like, like they're going to be completely bankrupt and
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.720]   so concerned because there is no solution. He gathers a family and says, family meeting.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.520]   I gotta, I gotta let you guys know we can't, I don't think we have the money to pay for
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.120]   your school. I don't think we have the money even to pay for this house, the mortgage.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   I don't have the money to sustain the business. We are, we're lost, right? And can you imagine
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.640]   if let's say a young boy, five years old, sitting there like, don't worry dad, I'll
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.720]   break my piggy bank for you. I got like 10 quarters and like $4, right? Like it's almost
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.200]   laughable, but in his world, breaking the piggy bank was probably like the greatest
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:32.120]   sacrifice he would ever make, right? But without God in the picture, it would literally be
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.560]   a juvenile thinking that in his world, he can solve everything, right? I mean, so many
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.520]   times through scriptures, I mean, you think about old Testament, new Testament. If, if
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:49.320]   a prophet says, your sins have removed you far from God and he will not face you anymore.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   And you're like, well, wait a minute, you know, maybe I have an idea. Maybe if we sing
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:59.240]   some songs, right? Like someone, someone can think like that. But again, many times in
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.840]   scripture, God is actually going the length to try to teach us, no, the distance is such
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.160]   so much bigger than, you know, right? The depth of your sin is so much greater than
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.840]   you know. And that's essentially what we're saying when we become Christians, like, oh
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.600]   my goodness, I was blind as a bat. I didn't know what I was talking about. All I was pretty
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.320]   much doing was running circles in my room. But when God comes into our lives, we have
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.080]   our eyes open. But what's more, sometimes it's not just a matter of just not knowing,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.400]   right? I mean, I wish it was just that we would, you know, it's just juvenile thinking.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.680]   All we need to do is educate them. All we need to do is have them learn. No, that's
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.120]   not the case, is it? Because it's not just naivety. A lot of times it's actually darkness.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:51.320]   It's a darkness that is over us that causes us to not see even if we wanted to, right?
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:58.120]   And this exclusion of God in the picture, it is the biggest thing in the picture, right?
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.640]   It's like trying to guess this 1 million piece jigsaw puzzle with one piece. What is this?
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.880]   It's just dark, right? Like that's how it's like. And so for us, we have to recognize we
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:19.000]   can't be thinking in the world's wisdom, the world's value, the world's understanding, because
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.440]   why? Huge piece missing. Here's a passage I want to highlight for you in 1 Thessalonians 4 3-5.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.920]   This is the will of God, your sanctification. That is that you abstain from sexual immorality,
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.840]   that each of you know how to possess his own vessel and sanctification and honor,
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:45.880]   not in lustful passions like the Gentiles who do not know God. Here's an interesting thing I want
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:54.680]   to say to you. Why do we sometimes act like we just don't know God, right? And I would just
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.600]   challenge you. The next time you're making a huge decision, I would, this is sometimes what I do
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   for myself is I take a piece of paper and I do start writing pros/cons, but I always leave this
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:14.360]   massive space there. Where is God in this decision? Where was he? Where is the thought of him? Where
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.400]   is the consideration of him? Where is his input? Like where is his good pleasure? Where is his
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:26.200]   displeasure? Where is he on this decision piece of paper? And that has to come. Otherwise, we will
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:33.000]   be acting like those who are Gentiles who do not know God. Did you guys know that May 6th was
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.840]   Sigmund Freud's birthday? And so a lot of psychiatry sites and stuff paid homage to him,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:47.880]   credited him for a lot of contributions to psychology and psychiatry. Now, the thing about
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.400]   it is for the thought of trying to assess a human being, he did have some really just as considering
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.320]   like one of the foundation laying individuals for psychology. He tried to assess what is the
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:05.080]   basic driving motive for an individual, for a human being. And he essentially started talking
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   about we're doing exactly what gives us pleasure. From the age of an infant, a baby, we have erotic
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:18.040]   desires. Basically, sex drive. The sex drive to a human being is the greatest motivator. What's
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:24.680]   very interesting is that he wrote that the sex drive for whether male or female is going to be
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.960]   the greatest weakness in the person's life because this is also the prime objective.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:36.520]   Interesting. This is also the prime motivator and he described it as the prime common denominator
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.800]   amongst us all. Okay. See, when you don't have God in the picture, that is actually a pretty
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.640]   good description. Even the apostle Paul would say, "You know what? If God doesn't exist, tomorrow we
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.200]   die. Let's live it up." That's pretty much what King Solomon is saying in Ecclesiastes. "You know
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.800]   what? If God doesn't exist under the sun, then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to not
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:03.240]   limit myself in terms of pleasure. So let's go at it." There's a rationale and reason when God's not
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:09.000]   in the picture. And it all kind of makes sense. Why would you deprive yourself? Tomorrow we die,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:18.120]   let's do it. But scripture says we know God. God, the one Lord, one God, one Father. He is our common
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:25.400]   denominator, greatest source, greatest motivator. We know something better. Now, because we need to
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.360]   move on, let's do the second part of who the Gentiles are. And it says, "Because of the
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.520]   hardness of their heart, and they having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:40.600]   for the practice of every kind of impurity and greediness." And what you realize is not only is
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.320]   he describing the mind of the Gentile, he's talking about the heart of the Gentile. And remember,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.240]   when he's talking about Gentiles, he's not specifically pointing to the Gentile sitting
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.840]   in the Ephesians church. It's like that one guy, right? Gentiles, ethnic, that's just like everybody.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:01.320]   Okay? It's anybody who's not a chosen person. It's anybody who's not part of the chosen nation
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:08.280]   of God. So essentially, don't ever use the excuse like, "But everybody else does it." Because that's
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.960]   the point, right? Stop thinking and wanting what everybody else wants. You're different. That's the
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:20.840]   point. Now, in taking a look at this and making observations, notice the descriptions that there
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:28.200]   is, I highlighted in red, there is hardness, there is callousness, there is sensuality, impurity, and
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.400]   greed. Okay? And when you think about that, when you think about the first two terms, hardness and
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   callousness, we are describing and seeing somebody who is willfully resistant. Okay? So it's not
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:47.080]   always an issue of just not knowing. There is willful resistance. I have decided not to care.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.400]   I'm going to be honest with you guys. That song, "Let It Go, Let It Go." I think I've mentioned this
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:58.120]   in a previous sermon before. "Let it go, let it go." A song that we just play over and over again
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.560]   mindlessly. If you think about what she's saying, she's just not going to care what anybody else
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:10.520]   thinks. Now, yes, it's kind of like, "I get it." You know, people are judgy. People are, you know,
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:16.280]   critical. They make you feel like something's wrong with you and stuff like that. But if you
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.880]   buy into that, that's pretty dangerous. As a matter of fact, it'll make you so isolated.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:28.920]   Some kind of ice cold castle. Okay. Now, moving forward, think about callousness. How repeated
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:35.480]   friction basically makes you desensitized. You know, what's really funny is I took the time to
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:41.960]   look up callousness, how to prevent it in WebMD. And it says, "Well, because callousness comes from
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.640]   repeated injury and friction, please stop your activity." I think that's pretty funny. Okay.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:54.920]   The thing about it is, brothers and sisters, beware. If you have this self-defensive mechanism
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.760]   where someone tries to talk to you and it's just like, "Wah," you know, "How dare you point the
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.120]   finger at me?" It's difficult to talk to you because your pride comes out and you're not
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.000]   willing to listen and hear. Right? You don't like the way they said it. You're just not hearing them
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.880]   out because X, Y, and Z. Okay. That callousness is a real thing, meaning that that kind of
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.320]   self-defense mechanism, that rejection of truth or anybody's input, it doesn't just stay there.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   It crusts and it hardens. Like the more you decide, "I'm not going to care," it doesn't just
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.960]   stay there. It gets worse. Right? That's kind of like what the picture is describing there.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.600]   What's more, it says, "They've given themselves over to sensuality." Meaning that's like a
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.080]   conscious decision. That's like a willful, conscious decision that's saying, "I'm just
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.280]   going to do this." Right? And I feel like that little phrase, like, "You know what? I'm just
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.600]   going to do it." Beware. Right? No, no. You make your decisions based on careful consideration
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.200]   of what glorifies God. Okay? If your, "I'm just going to do this," means, "I'm just going to do
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.920]   this at the cost of my own preferences, at the cost of my own convenience and my comfort. I'm
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.240]   just going to do it because it glorifies God. Good for you." But if you're sitting there thinking,
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.880]   "Oh, I don't know if I should do it because I don't know if God's going to be pleased. I don't
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.480]   know if I should do it because, and then people are going to be hurt. And then, you know what?
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.840]   I just want to care about everybody else. I'm just going to care about myself." If you do that,
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:25.720]   beware. Because that kind of decision-making is absolute absurdity and it opens you to
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.640]   every impurity. Now, one of the questions I asked in the Bible study was, "When you behave like a
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.920]   Gentile, what are the consequences?" That's what I'm talking about. It's not explicit in the passage,
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.280]   but when you look at this passage, there are descriptors here. There are descriptions of what
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.880]   happens as you give yourselves over. There's a callousness that happens, but also it opens you
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.920]   up to every kind of impurity because that kind of rationale, when someone says, "You know what? I
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.720]   know this is grossly wrong, but I almost feel like it's better to just do it at least once. So, I
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.560]   know what it feels like and I can get over with it. And then I won't want it anymore." Lies.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.840]   Absolute lies. Your selfish heart, once it gets a little bit of thing, will want more.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:14.600]   And what's more than that, it's going to open you up to every other kind of impurity because
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:21.720]   that's what that rationale does. Stop it. Stop it. Scripture says there is sensuality, impurity,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   and greediness in us that is growing and we have to kill it. We have to put it to death.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:34.200]   We're the ones responsible for doing that. So, there is a foolishness of heart. I think I was
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.760]   supposed to give that to you earlier. I apologize. So, absolute foolishness of heart, which I am
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:46.040]   describing as a will, desire. There is a willingness to want this kind of stuff.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:56.040]   Now, there is a passage I want to point out for you guys because, oh sorry, there is a,
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.480]   the reason why I want to mention that a little bit is because by observation, can we just want
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:07.000]   to observe and observe and observe, but because one of the things that it says here is that
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   because of the hardness of heart, that's why the previous stuff was going on. So, if you think
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.160]   about it, okay, all these descriptions of the mind, it's all futile and darkened and excluded.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.360]   Notice how it says because, because of the hardness of the heart right at the beginning.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.880]   So, when you think about that, you got to ask the question, what's the relationship between the mind
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.280]   and the heart here? Now, what I would like to just simply say because I'm taking a lot of time on
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:39.080]   this is that sometimes the greatest cause of our irrationality, the greatest cause of our
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.360]   frustration in our minds, it's not because I don't have enough brain cells to work out my problems,
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.800]   it's because I have a stubborn will. That's why sometimes it's so difficult.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:55.880]   We don't want need to sometimes overcomplicate why we do certain things. It's not always because I
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.200]   don't know enough and I don't have the wisdom to make decisions. It's because the rationale
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:07.160]   comes from the want. And that's why scripture says, "He who is able to control his heart
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.960]   is mightier than those who control cities and reign over kingdoms." Because it's that hard
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.080]   sometimes. And so, I kind of think, take a moment to think about myself a little bit sometimes. And
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:25.640]   I realize now that I'm, you know, I'm not old, but I'm not like super young either, right? 37,
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:32.680]   just like right there in the middle of prime, I would like to say. Now, as I think about that,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.720]   sorry if anybody is watching this older than me, I hope you're not offended by what I just said.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   Okay. Well, anyway, what I'm trying to say is sometimes I wish like the sins that I commit
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:53.000]   were like juvenile mistakes, but they're not. At this point, I've been a Christian since like 1998
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.640]   and walking with the Lord. And it's not like I haven't read the scriptures, you know, like I just
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.680]   didn't never knew that part of scripture, right? Like a lot of the sins that I'm committing now,
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:11.400]   I'm actually creating the rationale to excuse it, right? Majority of the sins that I commit now
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.880]   are not going to be knee-jerk reactions because I happen to be the youthful guy who's never
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:21.000]   experienced that temptation before. A lot of the sins that are coming up now are like temptations
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   I've had. And so, I just want to highlight that because this call for us to not walk like the
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   Gentiles, if you were thinking like, I'm not perusing out there like, you know, out of Vegas
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   every night, like living in abject like licentiousness and just completely disrespecting
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:48.040]   God. But at the same time, there are elements and patterns that are very similar. And so,
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.120]   that's what I'm getting at here. We have to be careful about those things. Okay.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.560]   For the sake of time, I'm going to pass this, but just cross-reference 1 Peter 4, 3-5
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:06.520]   as another challenge to us, a prescription for us, instructional to let go of that which is Gentile,
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.760]   meaning our previous selves. And so, he turns the page and he says, "But instead,
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:17.800]   you did not learn Christ this way, if indeed you heard of him and have been taught of him,
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:27.400]   just as Jesus, sorry, Christ Jesus, well, just as truth is in Jesus." Okay. So, after believing
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.280]   upon Christ and receiving all the blessings, Apostle Paul is saying, "So, you're different.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:38.360]   You didn't learn like them. You didn't think like them, right? You didn't receive like them."
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.000]   And what's more, he gives this kind of check again, which is, "If indeed you have heard
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.320]   and been taught in him, just as the truth is in Jesus Christ." And so, this is a huge challenge
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.800]   for us when we think about this. And I just want to take a brief moment to ask this, when he does
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.720]   the contrast and says, "But you, if indeed you," right? You need to take a good look at yourself.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:07.160]   If you're walking with some kind of weird notion and you're like surprised, like, "What? Jesus
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:15.000]   expects me to change? Why do I have to change?" How in the world did you get introduced to Christ
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.440]   and what did you learn about him that gives you this worldview and framework of mind that you
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:28.200]   could just simply be the same guy that you were 20 years ago and not grow? Jesus is Lord and King,
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:34.520]   saving you, right? Saving you from the pits of darkness, adopting you into his kingdom.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:41.880]   Any single particular description of the gospel absolutely necessitates newness of life.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:48.680]   So, if you did the, "Jesus will accept you as you are forever and evers and he'll never make you
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:56.040]   change," right? You didn't learn Christ that way. And if you thought that some people who believe
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.600]   that, you know, you need to accept Christ because he's going to then hear all your requests and he's
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.920]   going to fulfill the desires of your heart and we get to bargain with God in some way or another,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.760]   by giving him our worship and he's going to give us everything we will ever long for,
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.560]   you did not learn Christ that way. You did not receive Christ in this fashion.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:21.080]   Now, the major point I'm trying to hit at is this, because Ephesians was talking so much about the
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:26.680]   blessings you received in Christ, that you by nature of being in Christ, you have been made
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:34.040]   complete in him. You're different. You're different, like, in such a vastly, majestically,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.520]   and grand way. You're so different from the rest of the world. That's what the scripture is talking
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:45.160]   about. And so one of the passages I want to take you to is Romans chapter eight, such a powerful,
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.120]   powerful, powerful passage talking about how you're so different, right? Remember that in
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.640]   Romans chapter eight, verses one, he's like, "There's now no condemnation for you." Why?
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:01.720]   Because you've been set free, right? You've been set free from the law of sin, but now you have
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.600]   the newness of the law of the spirit and he's completely set you free, right? That's the
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.000]   beginning portions of Romans chapter eight. But here he says, "For those who are according to
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.640]   the flesh set their mind on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the spirit,
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.600]   the things of the spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.280]   life and peace because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God, for it does not subject
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:31.720]   itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so." Take a moment to stop right there.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.800]   The mind, like he's pointing also to the mind of the pre-converted state that the mind is constantly
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:45.000]   set on that which is flesh, material, and earthly, because that's what it's limited to by nature of
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.720]   its being, not so for you. "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. However, you are not
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:58.360]   in the flesh, but in the spirit." And then look at this, "If indeed," right? So check it. "If Christ
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:04.200]   then is in you, the spirit of God dwells in you. And if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ,
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.240]   he does not belong to him. If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.600]   spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:20.440]   dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.360]   through his spirit who dwells in you. So then, brethren, we are under obligation not to the flesh
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.000]   to live according to the flesh. For if you are living according to the flesh, you must die.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.840]   But if by the spirit you're put into death, the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:44.520]   being led by the spirit of God, these are the sons of God." Is it appropriate for believers
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:52.760]   to examine themselves based upon this idea, "Has God given me the spirit that I might be able to
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.680]   even at least, bare minimum, you should be able to see that guy right there in my life? I need to
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:06.600]   change that." Difficult as it may, but I trust the Lord he's going to change that, right? Does
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:13.000]   God expect immediate, immediate perfection right now that every single thing you see, you're just
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:20.520]   like, "Boom, done, sanctified." No, God said, "I will glorify you." But God has given us that
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.320]   incredible, incredible illumination of the eyes to be able to tell the difference, be convicted of
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.800]   sin and righteousness. That's the spirit's work in us. And then to be able to say, "Those are the
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:35.640]   things that needs to change." And so the next part of it, scripture says, "We need to learn to put
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:42.840]   off and put on." So I'm going to read this portion. It says, "That," okay, describing all of that,
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.080]   right? Like, "If indeed the spirit is in you, like the truth that is in Jesus is in you. If that
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:53.000]   truth, the powerful truth is in you, then that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.960]   aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lust of deceit. And that you
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.720]   renew to be renewed in the mind, sorry, renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new self,
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:13.080]   which in likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth." So let's
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.400]   take a moment to think about this a little bit. And I would like to make some initial general
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:25.320]   remarks, which is if you think about this idea, it's kind of like, I just, for the sake of
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:32.360]   analogy, imagine you came to me and you said, "Pastor Mark, man, I really want to grow. And,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:39.640]   you know, it's been hard." Let's say you have a bout with your temper and anger. "I've just been
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.920]   an angry man for days and days and days. When I say days, I mean years and years and years.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.000]   It's always been like this. And I want to grow so bad because it hurts so many people and,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.280]   right?" And then I tell you, you know what you got to do is you got to put that off.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:01.400]   You got to put on kindness. Okay? Right? Like, doesn't it sound kind of patronizing? Doesn't
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:07.880]   it sound like overly simplistic? Okay. When I took a moment to just meditate and reflect on this,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:14.920]   it does. It almost feels silly that the scriptures has to tell you, you have the spirit of God in you
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:22.760]   and you have the power. Now put off and put on. And essentially what I get is this picture. Like,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:28.440]   I feel like I am my son, you know, the seven-year-old, nine-year-old son. And my parents
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:35.960]   are telling me like, "Change your dirty shirt." Right? And that's fine. I was meditating and I
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.080]   was like, "Huh, that sounds kind of patronizing." Right? But I'm over it. I'm like, "You know what
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.640]   though? I am a child. And you know what though? Although it's sad state of affairs, I have to be
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.400]   reminded how to take off my shirt and put it on." Now, for those of you guys who have children,
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:57.720]   you know, as embarrassing as it may be, just simply the aspect of trying to get your son to
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.240]   like change his shirt, trying to get your child to change your shirt, it could be like the greatest
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.840]   drama in history. Right? I mean, think about all the different excuses. You tell your son like,
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:12.680]   "Hey, you gotta change your shirt because man, like there's like mud over it. You like spilled
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.400]   your milk and it smells like sour something." Right? And then your children all of a sudden
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.160]   come up with the most like masterful excuses. Like, "I don't have any shirts." Like, "What?
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:27.000]   I just bought your shirt the other day." Right? "I even put it on the floor for you." It's like,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.760]   "Oh, but this is my favorite shirt. I always wear this shirt. It's dirty and smells like rancid
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.360]   milk." Right? It's like, "Do I have to do it right now? Do I have to go right now?" Right? "How am
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:44.280]   I going to just do it later?" Right? And then what's more like you send your child to the room
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.400]   and you're just like, "Change your shirt." And your kid's sitting there like, "I'm just going to
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.600]   look stupid." Right? "I'm just going to look silly." Like that's one of the favorite ones.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.480]   Like, "It doesn't match my shorts," one said. Okay? And then you walk into the room to make
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.360]   sure they're doing their job and they're sitting there with their shirts, not really putting it,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.960]   they fake like they're going to put it off, but instead they pull it up to their eyes and start
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.880]   playing ninja with it. It's like, "Oh, look at me. I'm a ninja." Right? You're like, "What in the
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:12.360]   world? Just change your shirt." Okay? And then you grab the shirt and then you pull it out and
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:18.280]   you say, "Right here. Change your shirt right now." Okay? Now, if your child is an infant,
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.920]   you have to put the shirt on for them because they can't do it themselves. But if your child
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:28.360]   is of a certain age, you may be tempted to grab the shirt and forcefully just shove it over their
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:35.080]   head. But I think God treats us like his children and recognizes, not recognizes, but he knows.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:40.520]   We need to learn how to change our shirts ourselves. He shouldn't be doing that stuff for
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:47.240]   us. Right? I thought about that because, man, sometimes I hear people talk like, "You know,
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:52.200]   I've got this desire right here. It's all sinful and stuff." Or sometimes it's not sinful. But
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.040]   they started saying, "I just want God to take it away." I'm kind of like, "You know, I think God
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.960]   wants you to take that off. If you think it's bad for you, you should take it off." Right?
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:08.520]   Why does God have to change our shirt for us? If we're growing and we're mature enough to be
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.200]   recognized like, "Shirt's dirty," should change it. Right? That's the way it should be. I asked
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:21.240]   one of the questions is, "Whose responsibility is it to change?" Right? And I think it's been
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:27.480]   a disservice if we think that we're just simply waiting for God to do it. Now, think about this
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:34.120]   though. Even within that scenario, God is going to be the one who purchased a shirt. God is the one
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   going to be the one who gives a direction which shirt to put on. God's going to be the one to
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.560]   show us, "Hey, your shirt is sour." God's going to be the one who says, "You know what? You can
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.920]   change that shirt right here because you're in the safety of my home." God is in absolute control.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:57.480]   Okay? God is in absolute control. But as our Heavenly Father, He expects us to be able to tell
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:06.040]   your shirt is filthy. Go change. That's my point. Why do I say this? Because the biggest problem
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:13.000]   and resistance of all of these excuses as why we're not changing certain things is not because
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.080]   God didn't give us stuff. It's not because God didn't give us the resources. There is deep within
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:25.720]   us something that says, "But I love this shirt. It's my favorite. But in all the other shirts,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:31.160]   I look stupid. But in this one, I look so cool." Right? Those are the rationales that needs to
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:37.000]   change. And that's why scripture says, "You need to be renewed in the spirit of your mind." You
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.040]   have to be convinced when God says, "Change your shirt. Your shirt's dirty." You have to agree with
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:50.840]   God and says, "You know what? My old self is corrupt." Okay? So funny. Again, using different
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.440]   analogies, some people who struggle like crazy with anger, crazy with temperamentalism. It's
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:02.280]   just like, "You know what though? This is my tough love." Okay? You can just redefine everything then
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:08.200]   to excuse it. Okay? Not everybody in the world needs your tough love. "You know what though?
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   This is who I am." It's like, "What? Who you was was corrupt." It's absolutely corrupt. And as a
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:23.400]   matter of fact, it's continuing to be corrupted with its deceits, let's say. And even with lust,
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.360]   while it's not always talking about sexuality, sometimes we lust for control and we use our
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:36.040]   anger for control. Sometimes we lust for attention and we use our anger for attention. We lust for a
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.520]   lot of different things. Typically, when we are angry like that, we use our anger to get what we
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:49.720]   want. So, unless we are in agreement with God that your old shirt is super dirty, we're not going to
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:57.400]   be actually putting it off. And therefore, you need to be renewing the spirit of your mind. Right?
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.040]   So, we have to be able to look at our former manner of life and ask ourselves the question,
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.920]   "What are the lies that were there?" If you do have a struggle, some people struggle with this,
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:13.400]   constantly doing white lies. Why? And what we need to put on is truth, reality. Maybe we need to put
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.600]   on humility because typically when you lie, it's because you just don't want to look even a small
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:24.840]   bit worse than you are now. Right? You just don't even want to look a little bit less. So, we lie,
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:32.280]   small white lies to save our face. Why? Why were you angry? Why did you want that so bad? Did you
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.920]   believe it was your highest good? Did you believe that it was your end all? Why in the world did
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.240]   you do that? We need to be the ones regularly looking at this stuff. That we look at the greed,
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.680]   like we're basically kind of like inspectors. We go into the house, like everything looks pretty
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.040]   good, but let me go periodically and look. It's like, "Man, some things are super off." Right?
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:58.200]   And what we want to do is replace, replace and renew those things that are corrupt. Why?
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.680]   Because truthfully, scripture tells us that when sin is allowed to reside, it will kill.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.440]   It's like mold. If you walk through the kitchen and there's mold behind your cupboard because
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.320]   it's been raining, you leave it there, those mold spores are going to get to your lungs.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.760]   Another better way to put it as another example is the way Jesus said that a little bit of sin,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.200]   a little bit of leaven, ruins the whole batch. Do not allow things that you see, like, "You know
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.400]   what? That needs to be fixed." Now, sometimes, yes, like the analogy of the homes, we see things in
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.240]   our house like, "Man, I really got to get to the lawn because the sprinklers are broken," but
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:41.320]   you just don't get to it. Now, when it comes to our own souls, though, we have to make sure that
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:47.080]   we have this impetus, that we are regularly taking those things and renewing it in Christ.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:53.400]   If we take a look at this passage, though, it says, "This renewing of the spirit and of the mind,"
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.880]   it says, "put on the new self, and this new self is in the likeness of God," which in, it's like,
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:04.680]   basically, which is in God, which is of God, "has been created in righteousness and holiness of the
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:10.120]   truth." And what I like to say is, notice that it's both the aspect of that your mind is being
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:14.840]   renewed, you're changed in your thinking, and you believe what God is believing, or what God has
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:21.160]   been teaching, and that you're putting on the new self, which is mimicking after God. And by way of
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:27.240]   conclusion, I'd like to have us think about this by saying, and so, today I've been giving a lot of
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   examples about children. There is this question I want to ask you. How do you make a child not spoil?
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.320]   Okay, how do you make a child not spoil? Well, one way you can do it is, you know what? When I was
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.280]   a kid, I didn't have all these toys. I didn't have, like, a wall full of Legos. I didn't have,
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:50.120]   you know, my parents didn't even hug me. So, you could deprive your child to teach him to not take
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.320]   things for granted, right? So, you're just like, "You know, I'm not going to hug you either,"
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.960]   right? You could do that as a means to say, "I want to teach you to appreciate the little I give
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:05.080]   you." Now, I'm not sure that's the best way to do it, okay? Because to be spoiled means not so much
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:10.760]   that you received a lot of love. Why? Because in every single one of us, we've been spoiled rotten,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:18.920]   right? That's the book of Ephesians for us. We have been, like, lavished, poured on with love by
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.600]   God to an extent where, like, our cup, the picture we should have is, like, overflowing, cups
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   overflowing with grace and mercy and love. And the embrace of God is so sweet, right?
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.920]   So, then, every single one of us would be spoiled rotten. You see, spoiled rotten is to have an
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:44.040]   attitude where you receive that, but you never mimic it. You don't know how to give it, okay?
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.040]   And so, the reason why I want to do this is because to say, if we are being renewed, we are
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   then going to be mimicking God as our Father who has loved us so deeply, and that we are mimicking
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:02.280]   Him in all of His righteousness and holiness and of truth. That we are trying to follow in His
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:07.320]   footsteps. Essentially, we're trying to look like Him. We're trying to be like Him, think like Him,
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:14.040]   feel like Him. That, to us, is both our greatest endeavor and our greatest reward. There's going
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:20.520]   to be nothing more glorious than to be able to reflect God's character, His truthfulness, His
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:25.080]   love. And what's more for us than what I'm trying to say is we're not just changing for the sake of
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:32.120]   style. We're not just changing for the sake of change itself. Our goal is very, very specific.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.800]   I want to make sure that as I change, I change into the image of my God. Let's take a moment
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:45.080]   to pray. Our God, we thank You so much for Your grace. What a challenge it is, Lord. What a
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:52.680]   challenge it is for us to lay aside all of our previous way of thinking, where we thought, "Oh,
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:59.240]   we were so good," and how we thought we were going to win this world's game, and how we thought we
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.840]   were maneuvering everything, and that we were going to come out on top. I pray, Father God,
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:14.040]   that we would recognize the game of the world, Lord, is futile. It's absolute vanity. And I pray,
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:19.720]   God, that we would all the more, through faith in Your truth, recognize the calling You have given
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.440]   us. And what's more, Lord, the privilege You have granted us, God, that we not live like this world,
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:33.240]   lost in its purposes, lost in its motivation, so fleshly. But I pray, God, that we would be
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.840]   renewed. And Father, that we would be walking with an incredible hope of what You have in store for
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:46.600]   us, and who You are desiring for us to be like. I also pray, Father God, that we recognize
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:55.080]   sometimes it is so difficult to overcome these strongholds of our thought, the beliefs that we
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:01.640]   have that are wrong. I pray, Lord, by Your Spirit, You would challenge those things. I pray, Lord,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:07.560]   by the truth of Your Word, You would break them down. And God, that You would replace them with
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.680]   the truths of Christ, with the reality of Your Holy Spirit. And God, through that, God, You'd
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.160]   cause us to grow in every way. We thank You for Your precious Word. It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:17.800]   Amen.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.280]   Amen.
