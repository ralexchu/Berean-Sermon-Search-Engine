[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   Okay, let me pray for us.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.960]   Heavenly Father, as we talk about Christ today, I pray that we would see truly the good part
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.880]   of the Gospel, that it cannot and we should not get to Christ until we see the reality
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760]   of who you are and our brokenness before you.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.680]   Father, thank you for Christ.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.480]   Thank you that we are people who are not just learning about how to perhaps clarify evangelism
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.600]   or the message of the Gospel better for ourselves, but Father, that as we hear about these things,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.840]   we're reminded of the fact that this is our very hope of existence, the reason why we're
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880]   able to wake up every morning.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.640]   Father, any type of joy that we have is hinged on this Gospel message.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.320]   So Lord, let it be a time of gratefulness, of joy, of worship for us as we learn about
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.200]   these things because we don't handle these things as if we're just going to launch it
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.000]   into evangelism, into this world, but Father, that this is truly our own truth.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.160]   And so God, would you teach us and mold us as we go into this material?
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.120]   Okay.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   So who is Jesus?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.840]   This is where we're starting here.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.880]   So the first, we're breaking the Gospel message down into four parts.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.420]   The first was God, the second was humanity, and now we're getting into this part of who
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.420]   Jesus is.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.080]   It is very difficult to talk about Jesus until you get through the first two parts in some
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.100]   way, shape, or form.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.760]   But eventually, this is the place, I would call it the hinge, right?
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.300]   This is where it goes from something that can bring about a very bleak outlook into
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.560]   something that's going to show the goodness and grace of God.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.800]   So if we're saying, "Hey, God loves you," this is where it comes in.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.840]   This is where it has to come in because even though God loves us as creation, once we're
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.580]   broken into sin, we are clearly and confidently and with conviction able to say that God hates
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400]   all sin.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.800]   And God hates then all sinners.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.580]   God loves His creation.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.520]   He loves the fact that there is some semblance of the image that He's created inside of us
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.400]   and that there is a redemptive quality that's going to be happening as He looks at all creation
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.480]   that He will save some.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   So He loves humanity, but He does indeed hate the sinner.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.680]   So Roman numeral one, Jesus is God.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.900]   We're finally getting to Jesus.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.740]   And even when we're talking about Jesus, we don't start with, "Jesus loves you and He
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.000]   died for you."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   We start here again.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.720]   We're like, we're going all the way back.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.480]   Remember that God we talked about?
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.960]   Actually, Jesus is God.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.160]   We will this time start maybe from Tim and then we'll kind of go this way.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   So John 1030.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   It's a quick one.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   I am a father for one.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   Yes.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   So simple.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   Okay.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   And the next, John 1, 1 and 14.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   In the beginning was the worst and the worst was his God and the worst was God and the
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   worst became flesh as well as the mother.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   And He became His glory.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:29.480]   Glory as of His only begotten Son, the Father, full of grace and mercy.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   We all know this one.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.760]   Like every time a Jehovah's Witness comes in, this is what we jump to.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:45.160]   And then Isaiah 9.6.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.000]   This is the one I really like using with Jehovah's Witnesses.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.640]   We ask, "Who are they talking about?"
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.280]   And they're going to say, "Jesus."
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.160]   And then you look at it and you go, "Why is He called Mighty God, Eternal Father?"
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.040]   It's actually confusing for us too, but we won't go there today.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.120]   Colossians 2.9.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   And then Titus 2.11-15.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:50.200]   all sin, to forgive all that is evil, and to purify for Himself a people for His own
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   possession, zealous for good deeds.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   Let no one disregard these."
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Okay.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   I added that whole section just because it's so good.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   But the idea there is right in the middle.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   The appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   And then we have a couple of other points there.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:06.040]   1 John 3.5, Revelation 17.14, Hebrews 1.1-8, Colossians 1.16-19, and many, many more.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.440]   Jesus as God is the focal point of the gospel.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.560]   Now the second part of that focal point is going to be Roman numeral number two here.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.520]   So you just want to make sure to hit these two points.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.440]   Jesus came, though, as sinless man.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.040]   The Roman letter A would be that He is sinless.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:40.160]   Can we keep going with Hebrews 4.15?
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.880]   And then John 3.5?
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.560]   Okay.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.320]   So we have to hit both qualities of Christ.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.080]   He came as man, and we'll talk about that now, but He came sinless.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.480]   I would say in your mind, order it in that way.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.320]   Just to make sure that you don't mess something up in your own mind.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.960]   Before you get to the fact that He was man, He is sinless as He comes.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.560]   Because we are coming from the fact that Jesus is God, and nothing gets lost in translation
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.720]   there in terms of His absolute holiness.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.440]   The letter B, ultimately, though, is the fact that He is man.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   So John 4.2?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   And then Galatians 4.4.5?
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   And then Philippians?
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:07:08.560]   "Who, being in the form of God, did not consider it lawful to be equal with God, and made himself
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.680]   the Lord God of His Father."
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.840]   So why is it important that Jesus is fully man?
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.120]   These are just texts for you to understand the authority of Scripture here.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.040]   But for us, I think pretty much everyone here has gone through BCC, and we've covered this
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.520]   material on Jesus being fully God and fully man, so we're not going to go back into that.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.440]   But if we could open it up for discussion just for a moment here.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.080]   Why is it so important that Jesus is fully man?
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.720]   He could fully represent us.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.800]   So if someone were to come to claim, and here's a substitute, it has to be something that
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.160]   matches.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.120]   So we have to take it from the perspective of God, who is the one who is being offended,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.360]   or even as judge.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:12.280]   And so if someone comes and says, "Hey, you were driving this car, and you ran over my
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.520]   sister and she died."
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.440]   And he comes to court and says, "Well, I'm going to try to cover over something like
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   this."
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.880]   No one's going to look at that and be like, "It has to be a life for a life."
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.280]   Your life has to play into this.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.640]   But if someone comes and says, "Here's my dog," or something like that, "Take this and
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   let it become..."
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   It just doesn't fit.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   It doesn't match.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.800]   There's this idea of fairness involved that really begins to show us that he needs to
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   be a perfect match.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.120]   But what else about substitute?
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:58.680]   Why does Jesus have to be fully man?
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:09.720]   Any other thoughts on this one?
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.120]   I think one of the important things is this idea of mediator.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.640]   A mediator needs to be someone who's able to represent both sides.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.200]   So if Christ is not man and he's removed from us, there's some kind of...
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   Let's just say the fullness of deity only resides with him.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.080]   Then for us, we're always going to be looking to him as someone who was not able to walk
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.840]   in my shoes.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.560]   He was not able to actually accomplish what I could not accomplish.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   Because why?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   He's God.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.880]   Of course God should be able to accomplish this.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.080]   But if a man is able to accomplish it, then it becomes something that on this side of
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.760]   the mediation begins to work.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.080]   So he is able to come into the courtroom of God and say, "I did it.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.720]   I actually did what they could not accomplish."
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   If he was doing that without coming down fully as man, that would not apply.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.680]   There are many other reasons why this is so important, but the fact of the matter is that
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:19.480]   Jesus had to come to the world in the form of man and the way that he lived is now what
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.000]   we are in sanctification becoming like.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.240]   If you want to be very, very careful about how you slice it, we are not becoming more
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   like God.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.360]   We are becoming more like Christ.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.000]   And that is very, very important to remember for all of us.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.640]   That we are growing in Christ-likeness.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   So even the fact that the Holy Spirit resides within us, when it says in John chapter 1
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.400]   verse 1, "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God and the Word was God."
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.480]   And then you jump to verse 14 where it says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.920]   The idea there is the word tabernacle, that he tabernacled among us.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.960]   And so if you think of the idea of tabernacle, it is a place where God is able to reside.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.440]   It is a place where God's presence comes.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.000]   So Christ becomes that person who comes and opens the way to this.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.480]   He opens up the doorway so that as we become like Christ, the Holy Spirit is actually able
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.160]   to reside within us.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.400]   There is no way for God's presence to be with us unless the Holy Spirit is within us.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.360]   And there is no way for the Holy Spirit to be within us unless Christ is able to kind
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.680]   of unlock that for us.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.700]   And it is a little bit heady and you do not need to bring these things in, but for you
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.440]   to understand why it is so important that Jesus came as sinless man.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   Any questions about this one?
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Yeah?
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   One of the arguments that you are posing is that because Christ is God and that we
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   are trying to be more like Christ, wouldn't someone say you are still trying to be like
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.440]   God in that sense?
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.960]   Yeah, and the reason why I say be careful about this is because, not because we do not
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.320]   want to defend the Trinity, but because it becomes a rabbit hole that takes them away
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.840]   from like, that is not even the issue for them.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.200]   When these questions will come up, you could address it, but I would say, I am going to
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.760]   bypass it right now.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:21.720]   I would say, no that is a great question, but if we can kind of talk about what I am
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.680]   really trying to get to here.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.800]   Because a lot of times, the questions that are being asked, it just pops up in people's
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:37.440]   minds as a secondary or tertiary question, but you want to stay laser beam focused on
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.880]   why am I talking about the fact that Christ came.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:48.280]   I am not here to defend all the nitty gritty, which I can do, but what I want to do is really
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.360]   show you that Christ came.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.260]   Historically, He came.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.240]   He came into the world and He did these things and the fact of the matter is, He rose from
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   the dead.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.800]   There is a reason why worldwide Christianity has exploded onto the scene, where other religions
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.200]   take generations to solidify, this was momentary.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.680]   He came as God into this world as man.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:19.720]   He claimed His deity and people saw Him and people were proclaiming His deity.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.520]   I am not trying to wiggle my way out of it, you are trying to keep them very focused on
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.080]   that.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:33.720]   So I am not going to answer it because of that reason.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:53.240]   We have this understanding that Christ is the only one who can reconcile us.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:01.880]   So we saw God being holy and just and righteous and fair, wrathful against sin, and then humanity
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:10.640]   then falls under that, that umbrella of wrath that is just waiting to fall down upon humanity
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.280]   and demolish humanity.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.120]   That is just waiting there.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.880]   And so the question that automatically happens after points one and two of the gospel is
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   what?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.120]   Who is going to save me?
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.920]   What am I going to do then?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.480]   And the answer to that is going to be only God can save you.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.280]   Very quickly, if you go through points one and two, you are going to look around and
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.440]   be like, "Okay, there is nobody that can save me from God except Him."
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:42.900]   So then Christ coming down in the form of man, there is no other conceivable way of
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.440]   salvation to be able to occur in this.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.880]   Because we are saying, "I need to pay an eternal punishment.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.120]   The only way I could pay that eternal punishment is through eternal hell.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.000]   But can anybody save me from this?"
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.280]   Well, the fairness of God would lack in any scenario I can conjure up.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.880]   We could not even actually come up with this answer.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.800]   That is why there is a part of Christianity, I believe it, because this is not man-made.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:20.000]   There is nothing about this that any form of logic can get to this.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.240]   That God says there is actually no conceivable way of humanity to even think there is any
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.800]   hope of salvation in the condition that we are in.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.200]   But He says, "I will make a way.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:38.520]   And the only way is through Jesus because you need God Himself on that cross."
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   That is the only way.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.720]   Who is the only one who is going to be able to acquit guilt?
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.080]   It is going to be the one who has been offended.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.560]   So it is really confusing.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   People call it, theologians call it a scandalous grace.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.840]   But the idea is when He hangs on that cross, the only holy, just, righteous one is hanging
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:06.280]   on that cross who is able to say then, "Now I can pay for your sins."
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:12.560]   Which is a mind-blowing concept that I know that I ought to be spending the rest of eternity
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.200]   in hell.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:23.100]   Every day, if you call it a million years, if you call it a trillion years, that I should
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.880]   be subject to that kind of wrath.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:36.600]   Christ on that cross was able to absorb that relatively in an instant.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.920]   And so only someone who is eternal is able to do something like that.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:48.480]   How can He, He is actually, when He was on that cross, He actually, in a manner of speaking,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.180]   was able to absorb the wrath that I ought to be spending every day forever.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.660]   And He took it.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.820]   And so every single one of us that is a believer in this room, He did that for all of us at
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.260]   that same moment.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.980]   Whatever you might say about the three days or the one day or that instant when Christ
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.060]   gives up His spirit, but He paid it.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.020]   There is no conceivable way that if this isn't God on the cross that He could be paying this
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020]   kind of punishment.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.020]   Any other questions?
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   I always have this in my mind, this very gray area, at what point is man and nature sinful?
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:46.540]   Rebelled against God, but Christ clearly did not, can't rebel against Himself.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:55.380]   So I always wonder what was the purpose of the temptation, the struggle, so that He could
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.380]   relate better to us?
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.380]   Did that come out of that something?
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.380]   I'm not quite sure.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.380]   Sorry, my question is very vague.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.380]   Oh no, no, no.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   I think it's a great question.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.980]   I think what you bring up would be secondary though, right?
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.540]   That we can relate to Him.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:15.100]   Like He can sympathize with my weaknesses, or I feel better about myself, you know?
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.420]   There's actually an element of that that's helpful.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.460]   But the idea is that He was the perfect substitute.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.460]   That's why.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:33.460]   But the first part of your assumption is actually that man is not naturally rebellious.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.900]   Sinful man is naturally rebellious.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:48.860]   Adam and Eve weren't naturally rebellious until they fell, but Jesus never fell.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.860]   He still felt the temptation like Adam and Eve, but the reason was Him.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.900]   And we could go into the dichotomy of the spirit and their flesh, but we probably can't
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.900]   do that this morning.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.180]   But yeah, so these are all good questions that could come up.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.180]   They're rare.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.180]   I feel like it's rare.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.740]   For those of you guys who go to evangelize, the problem usually doesn't fall with like,
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:13.140]   "Uh-uh, he wasn't like God, or he wasn't man even."
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.540]   But this is so important for us to anchor down in our own thinking.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:22.080]   And so if these questions do come up, I will say, sidestep them.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   With confidence though.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Don't be like, "Uh-oh."
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.860]   You know, like that kind of thing.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:31.180]   But sidestep it with confidence in the fact of the matter, or in the fact that Christ,
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:40.140]   oh, okay, I'm really like fuzzy this morning, that this isn't their main concern.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.800]   So okay, so let's move on.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.420]   What has Jesus done?
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:52.860]   So Roman numeral number one, Jesus died on the cross to pay your penalty.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:20:02.380]   And this is judicial.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:11.220]   So I think the legal and the relational thing is spoken of all through scripture.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.420]   So we talked about a little bit of that.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.980]   Humanity is broken.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.940]   So some of the ramifications of that was that there's a judicial ramification in the court
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.060]   of law, what we're declared to be.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.780]   And also the relational thing, I'm just like, man, there's a foreignness about us.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.540]   Well, Jesus came to bridge both.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:40.860]   Second Corinthians 5.21, wherever we left off.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.860]   The first Peter.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.860]   "Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, having died the sins,
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.860]   might live for righteousness by whose stripes we were healed."
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.860]   In Colossians.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.860]   "And we have been saved by the blood of Christ, and we are saved by the blood of Christ."
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:21:06.460]   Okay, and then some other supporting verses, and there are more.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.500]   Jesus died on the cross to pay the penalty, legally, judicially.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.460]   He bridged the divide in his own body by paying.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.260]   There was no, it's not just striking it as if, oh, I never saw it.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.420]   It's like he actually paid it.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.420]   There's a difference there.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.620]   That Jesus actually paid my debt.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.860]   And then Roman numeral two, Jesus' death also restores us to God.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.220]   This is the relational.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.220]   First Peter 3.18.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   "Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, and he might
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.220]   bring us to God, being put to death and nuflaged, but made alive in his Son."
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:54.220]   I think that when I walk people through conversion, people get stuck on the first and then forget
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.900]   the second.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.660]   And when I ask, oh, this is your testimony, okay, was there a brokenness of sin?
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.140]   Many people say, yeah, there's a brokenness here now.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:13.740]   But then for a long time after that, they still feel like kind of afraid under the mighty
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.740]   hand of God.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.900]   And for a long time, I was trying to figure out what that was because I understand it.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.120]   I kind of feel like that too sometimes.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.340]   But really being able to feel the freedom of a relationship of someone who forgives
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.540]   you, that can be done only through the cross of Christ who says, now you are brought into
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.180]   union with God through my body.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.500]   If you're to ask someone, I say, hey, do you feel like God's forgiven you?
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:44.940]   You'd be surprised how many people feel like, I'm not sure.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.540]   We need to bring them to this point.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:52.820]   God will completely forgive you when he looks upon you that he will, because of Christ and
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:57.700]   who he is and what he did on that cross, there is nothing there.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.860]   There is nothing that he looks upon you and he will look upon you as he would look upon
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.100]   his very own son.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.740]   And this is part of the good news of the gospel.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.620]   And then Roman numeral three, we're going to be a little behind here today.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.260]   Jesus was sacrificed out of a love for humanity.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.460]   Jesus was sacrificed out of a love for humanity.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.540]   So God desires for people like, when you walk with people and say, hey, do you feel like
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.540]   God's forgiven you?
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.900]   And they'll say, I'm not sure.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:33.180]   The next question I'll ask is, well, did you ask him to forgive you though?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.180]   And they'll be like, I think so.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.460]   And I'll say, tell me what you said when you became a Christian.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.580]   And they'll say like, I was confessing my sins.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.980]   So they were saying like, I was broken.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:51.660]   And I said, God, I'm selfish.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660]   I hate people.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.500]   I'm an angry person.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.140]   They'll say all these things.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.180]   But sometimes people will just sit there and be like, God, I'm sorry.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.700]   Will you forgive me though?
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.220]   And then receive his forgiveness.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.380]   And God really desires this whole restoration with them.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.220]   That there is no partial restoration, even in sanctification.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:17.820]   It's a whole restoration with the sinner and himself.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.860]   He looks upon us now as saints.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.260]   Have you heard of worm theology before?
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.260]   Worm theology is awesome, and then it's the worst thing in the world.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:34.940]   So the awesome portion is, it shows the person who is broken before God, and it's like,
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.180]   so man, I am a wicked sinner.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.020]   And then so, the worm theology, there's a biblical term in it, right?
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.140]   They'll say, I'm a worm before God.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.540]   That goes only halfway.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.700]   So that's good, unless you stay there.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.180]   If you stay there, the freedom of the gospel never comes to you.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.020]   The gospel says, no, you are no longer there though.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:03.460]   You are completely purged of all sin legally.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.340]   And now you are, everything that happens then has already been paid on the cross.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.940]   We're afraid that we're going to look at that and abuse that grace, right?
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.100]   We're going to grow licentious in it.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.820]   But that's actually the gospel though.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:21.020]   That every sin from here to the moment I die has been paid for by Christ.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.540]   That's actually a very freeing gospel.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.680]   And that it gives you the wings to be able to.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.860]   And so we have to get them to this point of not just someone being broken over sin and
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.140]   saying therefore I will accept the love of God.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:37.500]   But they need to feel that bridging of like, oh, you're saying God loves me?
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.140]   Great, I place my faith in Christ.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:46.380]   But you have to walk them through the repentance and the accepting of forgiveness and the confessing
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:52.380]   of sin and asking them really, do you believe that Christ has fully paid for your sin now?
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.700]   That has to be there in this.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.380]   And we're going to talk more about that next week.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.380]   John 3, 16.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.380]   "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.380]   him shall not perish but have eternal life.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.380]   For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:13.940]   be saved through him."
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:19.660]   So God sent Jesus to be a sacrifice because of his great love for humanity.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.060]   There's a song I grew up singing, it's called "Above All."
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.100]   Do you know that song?
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:30.020]   At the end, so it's a whole song that builds up like, God is above all things and at the
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.620]   end it says he loved me above all.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.860]   And so I grew up like, really moved by that kind of song and then later on I was like,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.580]   wait a second, this is a weird song.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.380]   Did God really love me above all things?
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.100]   And so I went back and forth and then I went the opposite direction though of saying like,
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.460]   no, you know, it's all about God's glory.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.180]   He was thinking just about his glory and that was wrong too.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:01.060]   We have to be able to balance this out and say like, man, does God have this deep love
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:05.980]   for me where we would actually call it unconditional in Christ?
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:10.500]   That he would send his only son to take my place on that cross?
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.020]   Yes as far as glory, yes it will exalt him, but in the middle of that, is it because of
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.020]   his great love for me?
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.140]   Is this like a zero sum game or is this something that like can coexist?
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.780]   Oh man, it coexists.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:27.700]   Like on that cross, like Jesus sent his son and he poured out his wrath on Christ and
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.620]   I know he was thinking of me, you know, and I know he did it because of his love for me.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.460]   And when we're talking about this with people, I hope that it's not so separate and stoic
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.460]   from us.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:44.060]   Like when we're talking about God, the fact that God loves you and the fact that like,
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.900]   which is good, but that, but the fact of the matter is we're coming and we're saying that
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.260]   this is what I believe.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.220]   And it can't be sterile, you know.
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.100]   They need to see that this is a message that we actually believe and practice.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.380]   So okay, I'm not going to take questions.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.340]   Romans 5, 8 through 10.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.340]   Can we move over to Jason?
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.340]   God demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.340]   for us.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.340]   Much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.340]   of God through him.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.340]   For while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.340]   Much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   of God through him.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.340]   For while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.340]   Much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.340]   of God through him.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.340]   For while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.340]   Much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.340]   of God through him.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.340]   For while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:25.340]   Much more than having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his blood.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.340]   Okay.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.700]   And there are other supporting verses.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   So again, when you're sitting across from the person you're evangelizing, we are much
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.140]   more in the state of where they're sitting.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.380]   We should be understanding the shoes they're walking in.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.020]   Much more than saying like, "Hey, get out of our level."
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.060]   To really feel like there is no frustration when we're talking to these people.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.820]   There isn't.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.980]   If they're open-handed slapping the God we serve, then that's something.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:05.060]   But if there's rebellion in them, we're like, "Of course there's rebellion in them."
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.420]   If they're self-centered, of course they're self-centered.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:13.860]   We should actually feel this deep, seated compassion in our heart.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.740]   Because that's where I was, and I remember that.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.900]   So be very close to them in the place of evangelizing.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:27.340]   Because the gospel message as we preach it is very close to us.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.940]   Roman numeral four, Jesus rose from the grave and is still alive today.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.660]   That's found in 1 Corinthians and 1 Peter.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.820]   You can read those on your own.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:43.060]   And so don't stop with the death of Christ, but that Christ rose from the dead, and he
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:55.340]   is the only historical figure that rose from the dead and never died again.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.620]   So you don't want to go too far into this.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.020]   People talk about enlightenment and what happens to people, but he is the only one who rose
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.660]   from the dead and that was it.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:10.660]   And that was the end of the story, that he continues life like that.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.020]   So you get them to this point where when you're talking about his humanity, you are going
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.940]   to need to go into the fact that he was a historical figure.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:25.140]   Any secular historian will scoff at any secular person who doesn't believe in the historicity
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.140]   of Christ.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.540]   It's not up for debate anymore.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:36.220]   And people like to just throw things out there to kind of be a rabble-rouser, but he was
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.780]   a person born into the world and we are saying he rose from the grave.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.900]   And all of these people then attested to that fact and were willing to die for that fact.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.180]   And there's a lot of apologetics you could go into that, and I know you guys are thinking
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:55.620]   of a lot of that kind of stuff, but let's move on.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.780]   So this Saturday we're going evangelizing.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.200]   I sent the list over to June.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.900]   If you didn't email me back and you're still planning on going, I think you could still
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.900]   message June.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:26.740]   The best thing would be that Google form.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.260]   I think because you're part of this class, you might not want to send in on the seminar.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.260]   It's just going to be the same stuff.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.500]   I'm just going to condense it.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.740]   If you want to come, I guess that would be good too.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.180]   There's lunch at 1130 at UTC.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.940]   Okay, cool.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.860]   And then secondly, now we're going to start to put these things into practice and it's
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.940]   going to be forced.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:54.260]   So you are going to think of one individual and next week you're going to bring the name
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.880]   of that individual and then we're going to share it with each other so that the final
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.380]   week we're going to share with each other how you shared the gospel with this individual.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.100]   It's just accountability to practice what we're learning.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.100]   So we're going to be practicing that in cold evangelism this Saturday, but come with somebody
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.060]   that you really want to share the whole gospel with.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:20.580]   Okay, and ask them, "Hey, can I sit down and actually share the gospel with you?"
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.860]   And you would probably want to kind of go through your notes, rehearse it, think through
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.860]   things.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.840]   If you want to make it a dialogue, you can.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.740]   If you want to just say, "Hey, can you just hear me out?"
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.060]   And then at the end of this dialogue you could do that.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:37.680]   Just give them the whole gospel and then sit down and say, "Have you heard that before?"
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.700]   We think that a lot of Americans, because we live in America, have heard the gospel
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.180]   message before.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.220]   Don't do that.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.340]   Don't think that they have.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.540]   Assume they don't know the gospel.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.300]   I think you should do that with every unbeliever.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.900]   Just assume they don't know the gospel.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.700]   If they prove otherwise and they're able to articulate it, that's different.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:04.340]   But actually, more often than not, really when I go evangelize on campus, I feel like
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.620]   9 out of 10 people just don't know the gospel at all.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.740]   They just heard about the name of Jesus, that's it.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.520]   Something about the cross and sin.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.200]   But they don't know the gospel.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:19.820]   And so we understand now the gospel includes who God is, includes who we are before him,
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.420]   and includes Christ and what he did on that cross.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.380]   Here's your homework.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.820]   We're not going to have time for this.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.180]   I'll say this though.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:43.780]   We're bringing to people, and what we're saying is, we are bringing to you so great a salvation.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.380]   And when we say, "What is the salvation?"
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:53.240]   I think it can be easy to think about it very two-dimensionally and think that it's Jesus
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:59.540]   dying on the cross for my sins, and so I don't get to go to hell, I get to go to heaven.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.900]   And that's really, really good.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.500]   But the salvation story runs very deep.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.820]   And I wanted to do this, but we're not going to have time.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.080]   But when we think about what atonement is, the work Christ did in his life and death
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.540]   to earn our salvation, it's actually very complex.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.420]   And so we have words.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:23.180]   We're not trying to be like all hoity-toity Christians, but there are words for this.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.900]   There's word for expiation, that our guilt is actually taken away from us.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.660]   I don't think you, I'm going to go too fast for you to write it down, sorry.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.280]   Propitiation, that God's wrath is at peace.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.100]   These are different things.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.740]   That now, the belief of expiation is that there is no longer guilt on me.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.180]   You'd be surprised how many people believe so wholeheartedly propitiation without believing
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.180]   in expiation.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:51.380]   And so they believe that God's wrath is at peace, but I still feel guilty.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.700]   These are biblical matters, that Christ actually removes guilt from us so that we don't walk
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.420]   around guilty anymore.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.860]   There's reconciliation, that he brought into right and restored relationship.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.580]   We are no longer enemies of God.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.900]   When he looks at me, I ask people, "Do you feel like God's constantly disappointed in
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   you?"
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.460]   Man, think about how people answer that.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.220]   Think about how you answer that, depending on how you were this past week.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.980]   Like that he's disappointed in me.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.060]   What are you trying to say with that?
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:25.180]   Redemption is not just that he saved us and rescued us out of the water as we were drowning.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:31.860]   It's that he actually had to pay something to rescue us out of that drowning.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:36.180]   I think redemption, the idea of redeeming, you know redeeming is like a coupon you take
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.820]   in and you get something back.
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:44.780]   The idea of redeeming is, oh, you know the gospel just does not make any sense.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:50.140]   There's one thing for God to save people who are so ugly in their sin, right?
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.060]   Dead, foul, filthy creatures.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.340]   We talked about cockroach eggs.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.940]   There's no one that would want to save these things.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   But it's another thing to say that I am going to pay something to redeem them.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.920]   And there's another thing to say that that payment is going to be what is most precious
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   to me.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:15.560]   Like the increasing intensity as to the cost of this redemption is like mind blowing.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.160]   Substitutionary, that it was a substitution to atonement.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.200]   That Jesus was a substitute that brought about the atonement.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   And this is when we think about the deeper theology of Christ being fully God, fully
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   man.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.060]   What was actually accomplished on that cross?
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.920]   Why is it that he was considered the Lamb of God who came to take away the sin of the
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.920]   world?
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.400]   Why was, what was the priest in this?
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.080]   Why is it that when we read the Pentateuch that it expands our idea of what Christ did
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.400]   on that cross?
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.360]   All these things, it deepens so that when we look at the cross, when we come about to
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.960]   Easter time, to Resurrection Sunday, that we're not just like, "Wow, Jesus died on
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.040]   the cross for my sin."
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   That everything that we're doing as we're reading scripture, that as we're growing in
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.840]   the knowledge of God, and that's what happened in Ephesians 2 for a lot of us, right?
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.160]   When Pastor Mark was teaching through Ephesians 2, we're like, "Wow, that's so deep."
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.440]   It's so rich what God has given to us.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   And these blessings, he's reminding us of how deep these blessings go.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.680]   They're not superficial.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:23.960]   And so when you go and you take the salvation to the masses, oh, you ought to be jumping
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.680]   up and down with joy in this, right?
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:35.440]   But I think a lot of people see Christians who are so versed in Christianity.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.560]   And so we're trying to take something that's coming straight out of our heart.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   Okay.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:53.560]   I was going to show you something that the Navigators have come up with, and I thought
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.560]   it was very helpful, especially for people who don't feel much confidence.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.960]   Have you guys seen the bridge analogy of the cross before?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.600]   That's something that's helpful, right, to think through, to try to get your way through
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   the Gospel message.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:15.120]   So you can sit there and draw it out, or you can actually just kind of keep it in your
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.200]   mind to think, "Am I guiding someone?" rather than constantly getting stuck in these little
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   holes.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   So don't get stuck in holes.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.300]   You want to see movement and walking.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.240]   If someone just wants to go into a hole and they just want to do it for this whole little
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.840]   time, I'd say, "Just dust your hands, dust your feet off, and then move on."
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.200]   There's no reason to do that.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:55.400]   So the idea of this is that there is us, there's God, and we're created in His image to be
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:59.080]   in eternal fellowship with Him, right?
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.200]   That's what, when we think of all the good stuff of Christianity, this is what we're
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   kind of thinking, right?
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   Or of humanity, this is what we're thinking.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200]   That we are meant to exist in a perfect relationship with Him.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   That's Genesis 1, verse 26, where it says that God has created us in His image.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200]   In the image of God, He created us.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   There's this repetition and voiding thing going on, right?
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   But in sin, what happens is, we're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:40:09.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:16.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:41:19.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:37.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.840]   We're not going to be able to do that.
