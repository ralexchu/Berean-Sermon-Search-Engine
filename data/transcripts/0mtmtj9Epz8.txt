[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.960]   and welcome to Bergen Community Church.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.280]   Is Pastor Peter Chong in the room?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.800]   Okay, he has an announcement for us,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.000]   for our family ministry.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   - Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   I've got two announcements.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.440]   One is for the VBS.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.200]   The dates are July 11th to the 14th.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.680]   So if you guys do have a child that's eligible
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   from about four years of age to,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.080]   like, incoming sixth graders,
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.920]   you guys can register for that.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.440]   So please do find the link on the app
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   or on the website and register that.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.600]   For every child, the first child is $55,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.400]   and then the registration for every subsequent child is 45.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   And so just take note that it's open only for members
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.120]   and potential members.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.720]   But in the event you guys are reaching out to a family
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   and then their children are not churched or not believers,
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.480]   and you wanna invite them,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.360]   we totally would love for that to happen.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.160]   And so what we don't want are, like, VBS hoppers, you know?
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.760]   And so it's just for our members only.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.360]   Also for our family ministry,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.480]   we do have a ministry for newly-year weds.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.600]   So three years.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.040]   So basically everybody married after 2020.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.880]   So if COVID affected your wedding, that's you, okay?
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.600]   So we have a couple of things that are coming up.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.200]   We do have around 50 couples at our church
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.440]   that are about four years and under.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.120]   So there's a big pool of a community
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.480]   that you guys can meet.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.280]   But May 13th, there's gonna be a barbecue bonanza
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.400]   at four o'clock near the Portola Springs.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.800]   The exact location is to be determined.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.480]   But if you are a newer couple, especially to this church,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.160]   and you've been married around three years or under,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.240]   this is a great opportunity for you to meet people
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.480]   in a very similar life stage as yourself.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.760]   And the following weekend, May 20th,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   we have the quarterly workshop.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.440]   And what we do there is just,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.720]   we do like a Bible study and a time of fellowship
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.280]   for people specifically
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   who just have been recently married.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.240]   And so we've got that going on.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.680]   So please not only mark that on the calendar,
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.600]   if you're not a family ministry member,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   a FAM245 member, please pray for that.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.240]   But if you are, you can register and sign up
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.760]   because food is involved and we do need a headcount.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.800]   All right, thank you.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.000]   - All right.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.800]   Welcome lunch for newcomers.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.880]   If you signed up for that right after service at 1 p.m.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.120]   at the cry room across the courtyard,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.200]   lunch is gonna be served
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.800]   and they're gonna start right at one o'clock.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.240]   And even if you didn't sign up and you wanna come,
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.360]   and again, this is just to get to know
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.640]   the church a little bit better.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.880]   Some of the leaders will be there
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.460]   and then the welcome team is gonna be there.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.120]   So if you desire to come,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.560]   just go tell the welcome team that you're coming.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.840]   But for those of you who signed up,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.800]   it's starting at one o'clock.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.720]   Just to give you a heads up,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.280]   on May 13th at 9 a.m., men's fellowship,
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   the quarterly men's fellowship is happening.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.960]   So please sign up for that.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   And then again, on June 3rd at 1 p.m.,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.000]   there's gonna be an annual golf tournament
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.620]   for fundraiser for our missions is happening on that day.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.640]   So just mark that on your calendar as well.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.060]   And then today is the last day to sign up
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.940]   for the early registration for the retreat
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.300]   that's happening on August 11th through the 13th.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.340]   And so after today,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.700]   the cost is gonna go up into regular registration.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.580]   So even if you signed up, if you have not paid,
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.540]   you're not registered yet, just to make that clear.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.720]   So I wanna make that clear.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.400]   Even if you register, but you did not pay,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.840]   you're not officially registered.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.180]   So we need you to register as soon as possible.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.620]   And those of you who have not registered,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.420]   today's the last day for early registration.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.680]   So keep that in mind.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.580]   Okay.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.820]   All right, so after I pray for the offering,
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.260]   we're gonna have time for our sister, Sakura.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.220]   I forgot how to pronounce her last name, so I won't say it.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.460]   H-Y-U-G-A.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.420]   But Sakura is gonna come up
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.140]   and she's gonna give her testimony
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.160]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.300]   So let me pray for us.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.020]   And again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.140]   we have a box in the back as you're exiting.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.980]   Let's pray.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.740]   (pastor praying)
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.780]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.060]   We thank you, Father, for sustaining us
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.980]   with all the crazy things that are happening in the world.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.180]   Help us, Lord God, to continue to stand firm
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.780]   and be the light.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.220]   Help us, Lord, whatever it is that we are entangled with,
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.500]   the sicknesses of our loved ones and our families,
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.420]   various things, Lord, that we are wrestling with.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.460]   I pray that this morning would be an opportunity
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.420]   for us to worship you, to be refreshed,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.620]   to be reminded, Lord God,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.380]   that our hope is in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.260]   I pray that this offering, that it may be given cheerfully,
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260]   may it be multiplied with your blessing.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:25.460]   Good morning, I'm Sakura Hyuga, first year at UCI,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.020]   and this is my testimony.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.940]   I was born and raised in a non-Christian household in Japan,
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.020]   and then due to my parents' business,
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.660]   I grew up having almost no interaction with my family.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.020]   At the age of seven, I started noticing
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.280]   how broken my parents were.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.900]   By hearing them argue about who's gonna raise my brother
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.260]   and me after the divorce every night,
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.780]   I thought I was the reason for their unhappiness,
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.940]   and thus their love was something I must chase to earn.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.820]   As I entered middle school,
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.420]   I realized that they gave me attention and love
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.900]   when I acted as a good student.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.100]   Soon after, I started pleasing them
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.440]   with my grades and leadership positions.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.740]   My decisions were based on what made them happy,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.580]   and I desired to be a proud, worthy daughter to feel loved.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.180]   However, their brokenness couldn't be fixed by me,
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.640]   no matter how hard I tried.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.820]   I quickly became so jealous of my friends,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.100]   who seemed to receive all the love from their parents
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.340]   without them even trying.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.780]   I was depressed and judgmental, wanting to leave my family.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.020]   So when my dad told me about studying abroad,
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.980]   I pridefully thought it was my chance
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.540]   to be free from my parents' burden.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.380]   After I graduated from middle school, I left Japan.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.660]   Unlike my expectation, I retained the desire to please them.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.160]   Then another trial came into my life as my grandma,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.600]   who basically raised me to develop dementia.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.800]   Constantly hearing how she felt betrayed
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.180]   because I left her back in Japan,
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.520]   I started thinking that I was unlovable
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.560]   because I wasn't capable of loving.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.160]   That made me desperate to find others to complete myself.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.080]   I pleased those around me by blindly idolizing them,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.120]   and by living this way, I committed sin repeatedly.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.100]   At the beginning of my senior year,
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.520]   my relationship and friendships fell apart.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.800]   I became so broken and hopeless
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.200]   that I considered giving up on my life daily.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.560]   And to stop these thoughts,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.420]   I fell for all material desire to please my flesh.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:40.600]   When my friends brought me to Berean after coming to UCI,
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.100]   a ray of light came into my life.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.680]   Yet my heart was hardened that I still chose to reject him.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.560]   Witnessing the brightness of light
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.240]   brought me to recognize the true cost of my sins,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.020]   and I believed even his unconditional love
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.480]   couldn't fix my uncleanness.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.500]   But praise God, while I was so arrogant
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.760]   to believe in my fallacy over the truth of God,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.360]   he was faithful and patient.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.520]   Through his love and power,
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.800]   my heart began to hunger for my salvation
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.840]   during the winter quarter.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.000]   The gospel became so personal as I confessed my sins
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   in desperation for his forgiveness.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.520]   Who can ever be so loving that sending his own son
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.720]   to die on the cross,
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.200]   that I can have a newness of life
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.560]   when I consistently rejected and wronged him?
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.980]   It was nothing but his grace.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.080]   Just as Jeremiah 29, verse 11 writes,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.380]   "For I know the plans that I have for you, declares the Lord,
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.460]   "plans for welfare and not for calamity
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.760]   "to give you a future and hope."
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.260]   He faithfully broke me down
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.060]   so that I could come to accept him.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:51.120]   By understanding how simple and deserving I am,
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.440]   I truthfully cherish him and long to be his servant
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.360]   so that he can use me for his glory.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.960]   Being saved doesn't make my life any easier.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.680]   I still face trials and experience sleepless nights
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.200]   that make me think darkness will overtake me.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.500]   But this time, I know that I am with him.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.420]   Philippians 4, verse 67 writes,
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.040]   "Be anxious for nothing,
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.240]   "but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.940]   "with thanksgiving,
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.100]   "let your requests made known to God.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.280]   "And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.620]   "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.520]   By acknowledging this, I will remain in peace
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.040]   and find joy by trusting in him,
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.680]   for I know he is a good God with a perfect plan.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.800]   Thank you.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:23:00.900]   - Grua, do you understand when you're going to the water,
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.740]   you're being united to Christ's death?
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.580]   When you come out,
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.100]   you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.300]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.420]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.080]   (water pouring)
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.140]   (water pouring)
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:29.840]   - Thank you so much for that powerful testimony.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter five.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.360]   Luke chapter five,
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.240]   we're gonna be reading from verse 33 to verse 39.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.880]   Luke chapter five, verse 33 to verse 39.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.140]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.220]   And they said to him,
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.660]   "The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.600]   "The disciples of the Pharisees also do the same.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.040]   "But yours eat and drink.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.060]   "And Jesus said to them,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.480]   "You cannot make the attendance of the bridegroom fast
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.020]   "while the bridegroom is with them, can you?
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.140]   "But the days will come,
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.460]   "and when the bridegroom is taken away from them,
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.980]   "then they will fast in those days.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.240]   "And he was also telling them a parable,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.820]   "no one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.580]   "and puts it on an old garment,
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.900]   "otherwise he will both tear the new,
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.240]   "and the piece from the new will not match the old.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.640]   "And no one puts new wine into old wine skins,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.660]   "otherwise the new wine will burst the skins
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.420]   "and it will be spilled out,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.340]   "and the skins will be ruined.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.320]   "But new wine must be put into fresh wine skin.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.060]   "And no one after drinking old wine wishes for new,
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.220]   "for he says the old is good enough."
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.040]   Let's pray.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:48.620]   Gracious Father, we pray that you would help us
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.660]   open up your word,
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.120]   that we would do more than study,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.380]   but to understand your heart.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.560]   Help us, Lord God, to have eagerness of will.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.280]   Surrender, Lord, that all that you teach us
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.980]   would mold us, empower us.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.780]   May your word be like the hammer that molds us.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.380]   May it be like the fire, Lord, that purifies us.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.660]   May your word go forth and not return
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.260]   until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.220]   If you looked at the question
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.100]   that I put on the Facebook last night
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.760]   about better preparing for this,
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.900]   to listen to the sermon,
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.220]   one of the questions I asked is,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.220]   how do you judge righteousness?
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.380]   What qualities do you look for in an individual
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.740]   for you to be able to say,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.780]   oh, he's a mature Christian,
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.560]   he's a righteous person, right?
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.740]   Give it a minute to think about that.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.040]   Actually, not a minute, that's too long, right?
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.980]   You probably have some thoughts in your head,
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.260]   maybe one, maybe several.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.300]   My guess is, whatever it is that you thought of
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.900]   is based upon what you may be good at, right?
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.400]   You're at a Bible teaching church,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.360]   so because the word of God is emphasized to the degree
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.560]   where I think if you've been here long enough,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.280]   either you're in outright disagreement,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.400]   which I'm assuming you're not,
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.000]   or if you are in agreement,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.040]   that's kind of like the measuring stick.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.520]   Like, do you take the Bible seriously?
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.120]   Do you come to Bible study?
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.560]   Do you do inductive Bible study?
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.240]   Do you have a grasp of the word of God?
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   Do you read it?
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.580]   When I was an English pastor of a Korean church
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.300]   before this church was started,
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.900]   in the Korean context, the emphasis is on prayer.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.460]   And so, in that context,
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.740]   if I didn't come out to morning prayer at 5.30,
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.460]   and if I didn't join the community of prayer,
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.740]   that was their measuring stick.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.940]   So it doesn't matter how much Bible you knew,
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.480]   it didn't matter what you did,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.940]   but if you didn't come to morning prayer,
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.440]   you're not a strong Christian.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.580]   In college, I was a part of a discipleship group, right?
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.260]   Similar to navigators.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.460]   And so, in that context,
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.340]   a lot of the measurement was
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.820]   how much fruit were you bearing?
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.660]   Like, where's your disciples?
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.500]   Right?
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.960]   Like, are you going out and evangelizing,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.420]   memorizing scripture, doing all this?
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.020]   So, the measuring stick was,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.880]   like, what are you producing based upon your life?
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.240]   So, whatever it may be,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.380]   your perspective may be based upon
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.100]   whatever it is that you may be good at.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.660]   And sometimes, the very things that we are good at
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.620]   causes us to be blind of the weaknesses that we may have.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.060]   I remember, as an honest confession,
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:36.060]   when I got really committed to homeless ministry,
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.660]   you know, it always begins with,
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.200]   like, I want to help the homeless,
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.620]   and this is the avenue for us to glorify God.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.460]   And then, frustration sets in,
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.720]   because people are not coming in and helping out,
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.700]   and, you know, everybody who joins eventually fizzles out.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.380]   And so, once that happens,
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.180]   the next phase of that is, what's wrong with everybody?
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.020]   Right?
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.920]   And I remember, there was a large period of time
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.940]   where I measured everybody's righteousness
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.040]   based upon how involved they were with helping the homeless,
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.140]   because I was so committed to that.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.420]   It didn't matter how much you studied, how much you prayed.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.180]   If you weren't concerned about the homeless,
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.980]   what good is it, right?
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.660]   It's like, doesn't it say in James,
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.060]   what good is your faith, right?
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.980]   If you don't practice,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.060]   if you don't have compassion, loving your neighbors.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.500]   And so, I had Bible verses memorized,
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.660]   and I used to have, like, memes.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.620]   They didn't call it memes back then,
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.160]   but basically, in my mind,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.180]   I saw a poster of a homeless Jesus saying,
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.740]   "How do you worship," you know,
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.860]   I completely forgot what that said.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.860]   How do you worship a homeless man on Sunday
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.600]   and neglect the homeless man on Monday?
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.900]   That was the meme, right?
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.300]   'Cause Jesus himself's like,
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.020]   fox have holes, birds of the air have nests,
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.660]   but the son of man has nowhere to rest his head.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.760]   In other words, he's homeless.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.860]   So, how do you come to church
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.900]   and worship a homeless man on Sunday
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.860]   and then completely neglect him on Monday?
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.460]   And so, I had all these Bible verses and things memorized,
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.340]   and so, everybody, in my eyes, was measured by
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.260]   if you were participating in the homeless ministry or not,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.100]   even if you were good at other stuff.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.200]   Now, obviously, in time, I began to realize
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.260]   that there are strengths and weaknesses in the church,
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.340]   and sometimes, some people are better at others,
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.740]   and so, the beauty of the church is people who are flawed,
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.140]   people are gifted in certain things
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.260]   where we disciple each other through our life.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.380]   So, maybe somebody is good at prayer
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.740]   and somebody's good at evangelism,
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.140]   and instead of pointing fingers at each other,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.400]   why aren't you good at prayer?
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.140]   We inspire each other, and we cover each other's weaknesses,
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.080]   but the tendency is whatever we're good at,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.260]   that becomes a measuring stick that we use
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.700]   to measure everybody else, even grace.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.100]   I'm about grace, right?
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.100]   The Bible said about grace.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.660]   Even with grace, it's like, but you don't practice grace.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.620]   Like, I practice grace.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.740]   How come you don't practice grace?
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.660]   How come you don't apply this grace?
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.380]   So, whatever it is that we think that we're good at,
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.940]   we have a tendency, right?
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.980]   Satan comes in, and he sprinkles a bit of pride in there,
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.780]   and once that pride comes in,
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.940]   your righteousness becomes self-righteousness,
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.060]   and self-righteousness always end up condemning other people
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.820]   who aren't doing what you're doing.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.060]   Now, why do I say all this?
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.900]   Because the conversation that Jesus has
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.740]   with the Pharisees and the disciples of John
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.420]   is in the context of them trying to measure Jesus
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.340]   by their standard, right?
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.440]   Why don't your disciples fast?
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.300]   That's the question.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.180]   Why don't your disciples?
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.700]   Now, it's not because Jesus didn't fast, right?
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.580]   Do you remember when Jesus came into ministry,
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.960]   what did he do?
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.940]   The very first thing he did was he fasted 40 days and 49.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.660]   So, it wasn't that Jesus wasn't fasting.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.980]   The Bible says that he constantly broke away
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.900]   to take time to pray.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.100]   My guess is Jesus himself was fasting all the time.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.420]   He just didn't require it of his disciples.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.100]   Now, this interaction that's taking place
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.220]   between the Pharisees and John the Baptist,
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.260]   even though it doesn't mention
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.100]   John the Baptist's disciples here,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.460]   in the Gospel of Matthew, it says John the Baptist's
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.640]   disciples were part of the group who came to question him.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.940]   In fact, in 1 John 3, 26 to 30, it says,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.540]   they came to John, meaning John the Baptist's disciples
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.820]   came to John and said to him,
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.460]   Rabbi, he was with you beyond the Jordan
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.540]   to whom you have testified.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.380]   Behold, he is baptizing and all are coming to him.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.380]   Now, I want you to understand what's going on.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.980]   Not all of John the Baptist's disciples
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.660]   shifted and went to Jesus.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.340]   Some of them did, right?
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.160]   Majority of them did not.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.980]   And so, they were following John the Baptist
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.140]   because he was the great prophet.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.860]   All these people by hundreds, thousands are coming to him.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.180]   So, he was, people were thinking maybe he's Elijah,
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.960]   maybe he's the Messiah, and all of a sudden,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.780]   that ministry of thousands of people coming to Jesus
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.100]   started shifting, coming to John,
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.380]   started shifting to John the Baptist.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.860]   And so, some of the disciples started to
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.100]   wrestle with possibly jealousy.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.260]   'Cause if you were one of the disciples
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.060]   of John the Baptist, everywhere you walked around,
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.620]   oh, that's John the Baptist's disciple,
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.140]   that's John the Baptist's disciple.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.660]   All of a sudden, Jesus comes on the scene,
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.240]   and John the Baptist is slowly fading,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.560]   and Jesus is coming on the scene.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.020]   So, the question that they're asking is,
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.300]   all the work that you've done, everybody coming,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.080]   now he comes, and everybody's going to him.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.980]   So, some of them were wrestling with this jealousy.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.940]   And John, John answered and said,
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.060]   a man can receive nothing unless it has been
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.580]   given to him from heaven.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.900]   You yourselves are my witnesses that I said,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.900]   I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.420]   He who has a bride is a bridegroom,
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.800]   but the friend of the bridegroom,
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.100]   who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.700]   because of the bridegroom's voice,
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.380]   so this joy of mine has been made full.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.660]   He must increase, I must decrease.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.760]   So, that famous statement where John the Baptist says,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.460]   he must increase, I must decrease.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.060]   He was speaking to his disciples,
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.060]   who was wrestling.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.500]   You were the man, you were the guy,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.620]   you were the prophet that everybody's following,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.240]   and then just flick of a switch,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.580]   he comes on the scene, and he didn't put the work
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.360]   that you put in, years of preaching and discipling,
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.540]   all of a sudden he's on the scene,
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.220]   and you're just kind of shifting over there.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.540]   That's the context in which this conversation
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.300]   is recorded in the Gospel of Luke,
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.140]   and so you have to remember that these guys
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.540]   who are coming to ask this question,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.660]   again, in the context of what we see,
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.540]   they weren't simply asking questions.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.620]   They were questioning him.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.160]   So, you remember, up to this point, what happened?
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.660]   Jesus' popularity is growing,
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.380]   people are coming from all over the place.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.160]   Pharisees, right?
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.300]   Christian leaders, the spiritual elites
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.780]   were coming all the way from Jerusalem and Judea
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.100]   to sit and to check him out,
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.740]   and Jesus, knowing that they came to examine him,
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.340]   remember what happens?
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.740]   You get a paralytic, and they bring him,
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.820]   break open the roof, they bring him down,
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.200]   and deliberately, Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven,"
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.500]   because he knew exactly what the Pharisees were thinking,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.300]   and as a result of that, they said, "That's blasphemy!
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.740]   "How can a mere man say that your sins are forgiven?
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.740]   "Who are you?"
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.740]   And it never says that the Pharisees repented.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.940]   They just go their own way,
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.720]   and then, remember what Luke says?
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.100]   He comes out of there, what we talked about last week,
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.140]   he sees Levi, right?
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.260]   The worst of sinners.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.140]   People, I mean, people despised him,
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   and Jesus not only forgives his sin,
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.260]   right, he says, "Come, follow me."
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.120]   Basically, in your face, Pharisees, right?
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.180]   I mean, it's like, if they were disturbed by him saying,
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.660]   "I can forgive sins," he didn't just forgive sin,
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.020]   he made him his disciple.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.780]   So remember, Pharisees came to check him out,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.620]   and they probably were thinking,
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.140]   they're the spiritual elites,
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.780]   they're the ones that everybody's going to,
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.020]   so if the Messiah is going to gather anybody to himself,
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.820]   it would be the Pharisees.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.620]   But instead of going to the Pharisees,
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.340]   he goes and calls the worst of sinners, the tax collector.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:26.100]   Can you imagine what's brewing in their heart?
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.100]   They're brewing in their heart,
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.580]   and they're thinking, "Something's wrong with this guy."
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.940]   Not only is he saying blasphemous things,
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.180]   he completely bypasses them
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.720]   and goes get a tax collector to be his disciples.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.220]   So right after that event is this conversation.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.980]   So when they say, "Why don't your disciples fast?
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.340]   "Pharisees' disciples fast,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.040]   "John the Baptist's disciples fast,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.720]   "why don't you fast?
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.220]   "Why don't you make your disciples fast?"
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.940]   Again, you have to understand that this was not simply
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.260]   a question of curiosity.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.020]   I'm kind of curious, why are you doing this,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.120]   why are you doing that?
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.220]   They already have problems in their heart.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.120]   They're starting to lose their disciples.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.700]   All the work that they put in to build up their reputation
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.980]   and whatever gathering that they had,
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.620]   Pharisees had their disciples
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.180]   and John the Baptist had their disciples,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.100]   and then all of a sudden, they're all shifting to Christ.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.440]   We're, we all fast, we all tithe.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.660]   What's wrong with your disciples?
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.620]   So this is not a simple questioning out of curiosity.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.960]   They're questioning him.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.560]   Now, there's a huge difference
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.980]   between asking question and questioning.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.120]   Asking question is you wanna learn, you're asking,
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.720]   and you can answer somebody who's asking questions.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.760]   Often, asking question is what leads you to grow.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.160]   It causes you to dig, it causes you to examine,
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.560]   but when you're questioning,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.680]   no amount of answer can satisfy somebody who's questioning
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.920]   because they've already determined what is right and wrong,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.120]   and they just want you.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.640]   They just want you to see what's wrong with you.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   So we say, why don't your disciples fast like us,
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.940]   like what we do?
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.980]   Think about how often we measure other people.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.340]   Say, how come you don't read this?
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.660]   How come you don't go to morning?
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.860]   How come you don't do quiet time?
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.500]   How come you don't, how come you don't give?
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.340]   How come you don't serve?
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.100]   How come you don't come out to this?
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.260]   Every righteous deed that we do, if we're not careful,
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.740]   becomes a lens that we use to measure other people
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.800]   if we're not careful.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.360]   Even when we're being gracious,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.940]   it becomes a source of stumbling block
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.320]   because, oh, you're not being gracious
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.560]   like I'm being gracious.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.220]   Look at the way Jesus answers them.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.060]   There's three things that he says, right?
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.060]   Oh, sorry, before I get to that.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.700]   I want you to understand why this fasting was so important.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.820]   The Jews had two kinds of fasting.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.700]   They had the public fasting and private fasting.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.820]   The public fasting was only required in the law,
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.240]   in Leviticus, on the day of atonement.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.400]   So God didn't have all these different days of fasting,
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.300]   only one day.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.600]   But they regularly fasted.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.300]   So there would be a disaster that happened,
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.520]   or maybe there's a famine, or they go into war,
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.040]   and so they would call a fast.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.560]   And so the public fasting was determined
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.780]   that they would do it every Monday and Thursday.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.180]   Can you guess why they picked Monday and Thursday?
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.240]   That this was universal.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.800]   Whenever they fasted, they designated Monday and Thursday.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:38.080]   Those of you astute students,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.900]   why Monday and Thursday?
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.180]   Because Sabbath was Saturday,
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.960]   so they were kind of spreading it out, right?
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.760]   So if they had Sabbath on Saturday,
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.960]   so they rest on Sunday,
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.600]   so they would do something righteous on Monday,
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.720]   and then there's three days,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.040]   so they just chose Thursday to just kind of even it out.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.800]   So that's why they said, "When we do public fasting,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.160]   "it's gonna be Monday and Thursday."
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.920]   So any time they fasted, it was Monday and Thursday.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.560]   It was just those two days.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.680]   Then there's the private fasting.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.480]   Private fasting happened when they were grieving,
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.000]   when they were crying, they were praying,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.080]   or something happened personally.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.260]   And so they would also fast,
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.040]   but in order to match the public fasting,
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.880]   they would always pray Monday and Thursday,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.380]   'cause that's when the public fast happened.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.080]   So it was, by culture, understood
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.480]   that if you are a good Jew, you fast Monday and Thursday,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.360]   and it became a habit,
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.480]   just like kind of the way we do quiet time.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.720]   If you're a good Christian, you do quiet time, right?
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.120]   You do inductive Bible study,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.840]   you do these other things that are required,
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.880]   and these are the things that we look at.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.960]   The problem wasn't with the fast itself.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.800]   Jesus set an example of fasting and praying.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.180]   We're commanded to fast and pray.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.080]   In fact, in the New Testament,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.160]   it says we are to be devoted to pray,
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.660]   and when you are truly devoted, you would end up fasting.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.440]   So the problem wasn't the fasting in itself.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.680]   It's what the Pharisees used the fasting for.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.520]   Luke chapter 18, 11 through 12, it says,
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.340]   "The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself,
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.640]   "God, thank you that I am not like other people,
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.100]   "swindlers, unjust adulterers,
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.680]   "or even like this tax collector,
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.840]   "for I fast twice a week, I pay tithes of all that I get."
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.920]   Do you see how he differentiates himself with the sinners?
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   These swindlers, these unjust adulterers,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.560]   these tax collectors.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.120]   But in contrast, I fast, right?
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.140]   He's looking at his spiritual discipline.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.860]   Contrast to all the sins, but look what I do.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.600]   I fast and I tithe.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.240]   That was their measuring stick.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.320]   That's how they measured if somebody
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.980]   was truly a servant of God, right?
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.420]   In Matthew 6, 16, Jesus reveals
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.280]   what's in their heart in their fasting.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.680]   He said, "Whenever you fast."
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.760]   It was already understood.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.160]   He didn't even have to tell them to fast
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.460]   because that's what they did.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.400]   That's what the Pharisees did.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.000]   "Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.480]   "as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   "so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.720]   "Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full."
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.760]   In other words, every time they fast,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.880]   they fast for other people to see.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.360]   When you are displaying your righteousness
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.000]   for other people to see,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.380]   you have to make sure other people know, right?
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.200]   If you give, I mean, you can't give
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.240]   and then walk around saying, "Look what I did," right?
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.360]   But if you're not acknowledged,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.960]   if you serve in the church,
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.560]   and at some point you're not acknowledged,
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.560]   if you're, like, whatever it is that you're doing,
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.080]   at some point if you're not acknowledged,
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.560]   you lose motivation, right?
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.680]   And I see that a lot with mercy ministries.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.280]   I go, "Oh, there's a companion that you wanted to do this,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   "and after a while they get frustrated.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.600]   "No one's helping me, and then there's this constant cycle.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.840]   "Nobody's helping me, and then nobody's acknowledging,
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.200]   "nobody cares, and they don't do it either."
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.580]   You start a prayer meeting, it's like,
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.880]   "Yeah, we need to pray, we need to do a revival prayer."
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.440]   And then after a while,
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.020]   "Hey, nobody's coming to pray with me.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.000]   "What's wrong with everybody?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.700]   "How come nobody cares about prayer?"
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.600]   Then after a while, you stop praying.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.500]   You go evangelizing.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.380]   "Hey, we gotta evangelize, we gotta do this,
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.320]   "and then everybody, come do it with me."
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.920]   And then after a while, you get frustrated
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.680]   because people are not excited as you are,
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.120]   and then after a while, it's like,
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.760]   "Ah, I'm not gonna do it either."
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.700]   Every good thing that we endeavor to do,
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.600]   whenever a little bit of pride gets in,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.400]   because we want acknowledgement, right?
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.240]   We wanna see something happen,
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.320]   and whenever that happens, we have a tendency to kinda,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   "Okay, then I'm not gonna do it either."
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.280]   Jesus indicted them in saying,
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.420]   you do everything simply for people to see.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.180]   In Luke chapter 18, nine, Jesus says,
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.440]   and he told this parable to some people
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.920]   who retrusted in themselves that they were righteous
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.160]   and viewed others with contempt,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.340]   and this is why self-righteousness is so ugly.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.120]   Self-righteousness doesn't stop
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.000]   with displaying your righteousness.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.860]   It always ends with condemnation of other people,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.520]   always ends with contempt with other people.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.400]   So if you pray a lot,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.660]   when self-righteousness and pride comes in,
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.000]   you judge everybody by their lack of prayer.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.080]   If you give a lot,
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.040]   you judge other people by their lack of giving.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.320]   If you serve a lot,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.880]   you judge everybody based upon the lack of serving.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.840]   So whatever good that we do,
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.120]   all you have to do is just tweak a little bit
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.920]   and to make it ugly.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.960]   Every righteous deed that we do,
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.280]   it leads to contempt with other people
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.480]   who don't do what we do.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.000]   In Luke 18, 14, it says,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.760]   "I tell you, this man went to his house justified,"
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.480]   and he's talking about the tax collector,
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.140]   "rather than the other," he's talking about the Pharisee,
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.480]   "for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.720]   "but he who humbles himself will be exalted."
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.080]   Now, that's the context in which the disciples,
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.040]   Pharisees and John the Baptist disciples
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.220]   are coming to Jesus.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.560]   Why aren't your disciples?
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.320]   So this was not an honest question.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.200]   This was more of an indictment against Jesus.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.000]   In fact, every time the Pharisees come to Jesus,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.640]   they're not asking him an honest question.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.100]   They're coming to indict him.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.320]   We knew you're not good.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.360]   We knew you're not righteous.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.480]   You can't be saying those things.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.600]   All these people are coming to you, but you're fake.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.420]   Even after three years of demonstrating who he is,
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.420]   even after raising Lazarus,
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.280]   they were so jealous of his fame.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.120]   Look at him.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.200]   He doesn't obey the Sabbath.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.000]   He has sinners that he hangs out with.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:52.960]   He's claiming these things.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.200]   He can't be.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.640]   So they're not discounting him
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.780]   because they've examined him and he fell short.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.920]   They want to discount him
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.060]   because he wasn't bolstering their egos,
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.640]   what they worked so hard to build up.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.580]   So they want to discredit him
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.840]   because they wanted to discredit what was happening.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.440]   Now, Jesus answers, and on the surface,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.640]   you look at it and you say,
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.940]   I don't really understand how this fits.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.020]   So he says three things.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.440]   One, he says, "You fast.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.860]   "No one fasts when the bridegroom is here.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.340]   "It's when the bridegroom is gone,
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.440]   "then you're gonna fast."
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   That makes a little sense.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.560]   I'm not exactly sure why he went there.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.320]   And then he goes, "You know the cloth?
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.560]   "You had old cloth and you put new cloth
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.080]   "or you get new cloth and old cloth
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:42.920]   "and they're gonna tear
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.120]   "because they're gonna shrink at a different rate.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.840]   "Now do you understand?"
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.120]   Okay, since if you didn't get that, let me tell you.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.480]   You know wine, right?
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.340]   You have old wine or new wine,
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.760]   you put it into old wine skin
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.740]   and then if you put it in,
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.280]   the old wine skin is gonna break.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.720]   And so therefore you gotta put old wine to old wine
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   or new wine into new wine skin.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.280]   Now do you get it?
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.300]   Now do you get it?
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.980]   Now if you just read that through, it's like,
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.460]   "I guess, right?
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.980]   "What is he saying?"
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.700]   Well, I'm gonna spend the rest of the time
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.260]   unpackaging this because what he's saying
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.020]   is very, very important, right?
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.700]   First thing that he is saying is
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.780]   the reason why they're not fasting
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.820]   is because they're in between two covenants
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.020]   and the old and the new.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.320]   And the way they fasted in the old covenant
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.200]   and what the new fasting is going to be
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.700]   is gonna be different in the new covenant.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.460]   So that's why he gives the illustration,
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.980]   "No one tears a piece of cloth from the new garment
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.480]   "and puts it on an old garment,
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.020]   "otherwise he will both tear the new
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.520]   "and the piece from the new will not match the old."
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.440]   Now just so that you can understand this illustration
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.980]   because every Jew would have understood
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.020]   what he was talking about
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.480]   because every Jew would have practiced this.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.140]   'Cause at that time, a common Jew,
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.240]   unless you were filthy rich, only owned one garment.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.400]   And they didn't have like spring outfit
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.880]   and then a summer outfit, you know?
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.360]   And they didn't have running shoes,
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.520]   tennis shoes, basketball shoes,
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.820]   relaxing shoes, church shoes.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.440]   They had one garment, right?
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.560]   And one sandal, that's it.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.720]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.120]   How many of you, when you were younger,
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:28.840]   when your pants ripped, that your parents
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.120]   or somebody put a patch on it to fix it?
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.460]   Okay, so a few of you.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.760]   Those of you who were born before 1970, okay?
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.940]   A few of you, okay.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.900]   I mean, long time ago.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.020]   I mean, right now you put the holes on purpose
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.260]   so you're not gonna understand.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.520]   You have no clue what Jesus is talking about, right?
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.680]   But those of you, I mean, maybe you saw it on TV, right?
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.500]   Maybe you saw your uncles, right?
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.160]   Back then, I mean, in our home,
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.720]   'cause we didn't have much money,
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.340]   so whenever our pants ripped,
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.220]   my mom would get one of those patches
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.520]   and she would iron it on.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.780]   So, and three of us being boys,
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.660]   we're playing outside, we're skidding on grass,
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.560]   so almost every pants eventually ripped.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.980]   It was just a matter of time.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   And back then, you didn't just go out and buy new pants.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.340]   They'd be perfectly good pants, just has a hole in it,
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.920]   even though today that's more expensive, right?
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.980]   So you put a patch on it.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.920]   So back then, they would have this iron-on patches
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.180]   where you would iron it on,
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.020]   and then after a while,
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.940]   you would have three, four patches in your,
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.540]   you got one on your back and then one, two on your knees.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.860]   And then if you have a jacket,
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.780]   you would have a patch on your jacket.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.460]   But those patches, some of those patches were not useful
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.140]   because after they did it and they keep washing it,
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.860]   just like Jesus says, the old garment would shrink
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.980]   and the patch eventually would just kind of come up
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.340]   because they're not shrinking, you know?
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.180]   Because it kind of had like a glossy, plasticky thing.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.580]   So after a while, they have to rip it out
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.420]   and put it on.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.780]   So after doing that for a while, in order for,
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.140]   if we're gonna, you know,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.700]   we're really committed to this pants
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.540]   and we're gonna keep this pants,
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.860]   eventually they would have to have a cloth,
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.500]   like a jean cloth or something that's gonna match this
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.060]   so that it doesn't rip when we wash it.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.260]   So those of you who's never experienced this,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.340]   this part of the Bible is,
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.220]   it's not relevant to you
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.700]   'cause you're not gonna understand, okay?
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.400]   But you could imagine what he's talking about.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.340]   So for those of us who are a little bit older,
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.980]   you know, know exactly what he's saying.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.900]   Every Jew would have understood this illustration
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.900]   because every Jew would have practiced this.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:38.780]   The meaning behind that is the old covenant is passing
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.140]   and the new covenant is coming.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.100]   That's what he's saying.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.260]   Now, again, this is all related to fasting.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.500]   And then the second thing that he says,
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.060]   he says in Luke 5:37,
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.540]   "No one puts new wine into old wine skins.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.740]   "Otherwise the new wine will burst the skins
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.580]   "and it will be spilled out and the skins will be ruined."
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:01.220]   Now, I have no reference to what this is talking about.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.100]   I'm assuming most of you don't either,
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:08.100]   unless you're winos and you've experienced old wine skin.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.380]   But I'm assuming most of you don't have that.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.180]   But you can understand the illustration, right?
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.700]   That the covenant, so he's using two different things.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.040]   But the specific thing about this new wine
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.140]   and the old wine skin,
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.460]   in Ephesians 5:18, it says,
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.660]   "And do not get drunk with wine,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.440]   "for that is dissipation,
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.340]   "but be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.440]   Many theologians believe that the new wine
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.260]   that they're referencing is the Holy Spirit
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.660]   and the old wine skin is before the covenant,
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.500]   the old covenant.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.100]   And this makes so much sense.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.880]   Because in Ezekiel 36, 26, it says,
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.660]   "Moreover, I will give you a new heart
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.400]   "and put a new spirit within you,
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.160]   "and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh,
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.200]   "give you a heart of flesh.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.760]   "I will put my spirit within you
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.300]   "and cause you to walk in my statues,
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.240]   "and you will be careful to observe my ordinances."
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.700]   In the old covenant,
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.500]   they just kind of did whatever God told them to do,
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.580]   and they said sacrifice,
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.780]   and they jotted the dots,
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.880]   and then went to the temple
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.600]   and did whatever God told them to do.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.700]   But remember what God says,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.940]   Jesus says to his disciples,
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.020]   that a time is coming,
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.860]   to the Samaritan, time is coming,
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.880]   where he's not looking for people,
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.500]   whether you're gonna worship on this mountain
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.100]   or that mountain.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.020]   Whether you practice at this or that,
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.460]   what God is looking for are people
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.860]   who worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.700]   In spirit and in truth.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.340]   So the difference between the old covenant
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.420]   and the new covenant,
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.260]   in the new covenant,
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.380]   you have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.740]   where in the old covenant,
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.060]   the Holy Spirit would come,
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.720]   and it would influence and empower people,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.460]   but it would never make an indwelling.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.480]   And the reason behind that is,
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.900]   if an indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.060]   happened in the old covenant,
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.420]   the person would die.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:57.260]   It was only after you and I had become made new,
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.420]   because we have been covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.780]   And so the Bible says we have become new creation,
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.340]   new creatures, new wineskin.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.500]   So now when the Holy Spirit comes in,
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.900]   we have new wineskin to be able
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.220]   to receive the Holy Spirit,
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.160]   and that's the distinction between the old
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.500]   and the new covenant.
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:19.220]   So I said, okay, I understand what he's saying now.
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:22.160]   So how does that relate to fasting?
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.380]   In Luke 5, 34 to 35,
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.300]   and this is the key, right?
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.660]   And Jesus said to them,
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.220]   "You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.780]   "while the bridegroom is still with them, can you?
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:37.900]   "But the days will come,
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.760]   "and when the bridegroom is taken away from them,
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.220]   "then they will fast in those days."
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:47.220]   So he says, fasting is related to the bridegroom, right?
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.180]   So who's the bridegroom?
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.860]   If fasting is related to longing for the bridegroom,
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:56.920]   who's the bridegroom?
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.780]   Jesus.
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.520]   That's what he's saying.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.060]   He just called himself the bridegroom.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.580]   I am with them, so I'm not requiring them to fast,
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.500]   because I am with them.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.380]   So in other words, what is he saying?
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.740]   One, that he is God.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.880]   Because in the Old Testament,
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.560]   God calls himself the bridegroom.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.100]   In Hosea 2, 19 to 20,
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.000]   "I will betroth you to me forever.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.200]   "Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.580]   "and in justice, in loving kindness and in compassion,
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.080]   "and I will betroth you to me in faithfulness,
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.240]   "then you will know the Lord."
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.460]   The whole book of Song of Solomon
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:39.780]   is about a relationship with God and his bride,
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.580]   and God is the bridegroom.
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:46.720]   And so when Jesus says, "When the bridegroom is here,"
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.860]   they do not need to fast.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:53.120]   If they were paying attention, they would have heard.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.800]   Not only is this man saying that he can forgive sins,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.640]   he's declared to be God.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:05.940]   In fact, John himself says in John 3, 20 to 30,
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.200]   when the disciples come, he's like,
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.760]   "Aren't you concerned that everything that we've done,
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.840]   "everything that you've done,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.180]   "they're all shifting to Christ and Jesus?"
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.600]   And John says, "You yourselves are my witnesses,
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.700]   "that I said I am not the Christ,
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.120]   "but I have been sent ahead of him.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.740]   "He who has the bride is the bridegroom.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.020]   "But the friend of the bridegroom,
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.160]   "who stands and hears him,
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.200]   "rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.300]   "so this joy of mine has been made full.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.080]   "He must increase, but I must decrease."
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.320]   He who has the bride is the bridegroom.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.540]   Who's the bride?
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.380]   Israel.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.960]   So instead of being jealous, John the Baptist says,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.980]   "They're all going to him because he's the bridegroom.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.880]   "And he who has Israel going to him,
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.380]   "he's the one that they've been talking about."
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.260]   So first of all, he's saying fasting,
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:55:00.140]   they don't need to fast because the bridegroom is here.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.120]   But what he's saying to them is that fasting
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.380]   in our spiritual disciplines is about Christ.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.560]   Fasting is about longing for Christ.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.000]   Quiet time is about longing for Christ.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.240]   Our Bible study is about longing for Christ.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.480]   Our singing is about longing for Christ.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.080]   And that's basically what he is saying.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.680]   The bridegroom is here.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:28.480]   Your longing has been satisfied because I'm here.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.080]   And that's exactly what Simeon,
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.640]   he was praying and waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   Anna the prophet, prophetess, in her old age,
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.840]   she never left the temple and he prayed and fasted
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.000]   because she lost her husband when she was young.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.800]   I remember years ago when I was teaching ESL
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.300]   to Korean grandmothers in their 70s and 80s,
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.980]   there's one particular lady, she was in her late 70s,
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.720]   and she would walk into the classroom
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.940]   and every morning she would say the same thing.
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.360]   It was so depressing because of her in the beginning.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.180]   And she would say, "Oh, I'm still living.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:14.640]   "God didn't take me another day."
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.440]   You know, I was probably about 35, 34,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.000]   33 years old at that time, 34.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.720]   So for a younger person, hearing somebody in the crowd,
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.400]   "Oh, I didn't die."
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.420]   So I said, "Man, she's very depressing.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.320]   "I gotta hear this every day."
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.040]   After some time went by, I was able to sit with her
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.640]   during recess and I asked her,
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.440]   "Why do you say that every morning?"
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.920]   And she wasn't saying it to be depressing.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   Found out that she was widowed when she was young.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:51.160]   She was married to her husband no more than seven weeks
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.360]   when the Korean War broke out.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.200]   And during the Korean War, within the conflict,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.220]   her husband died.
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.880]   And then she never remarried.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.740]   So she's been living as a widow all those years.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.460]   And every day, all she does is writes the Bible.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.640]   This is before computers and all this stuff.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.520]   And I don't know if she would have, even though.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.560]   She just took the Korean Bible and she just copied
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.980]   the Bible.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.760]   And she would open up her notebook and show me
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.200]   that she was copying, like all she did.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.220]   But for all those decades,
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.500]   all those decades, she's been waiting.
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.920]   So she wasn't saying, "Oh, life is miserable.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.160]   "I don't wanna be here anymore."
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.760]   She's been longing, longing to see her husband,
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.740]   the longing to meet Christ all those years.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.680]   And so when she says, "Oh, I'm here another day.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.440]   "I gotta wait another day to meet him.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.840]   "I gotta wait another day to meet him."
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:55.840]   And I can imagine when she passes how happy she would be.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:03.240]   Jesus was telling them, "You fast for me."
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.720]   For badge of honor.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.540]   "You fast so that other people can see.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.600]   "You fast thinking that somehow that gets you ahead
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.160]   "of other people.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.960]   "But fasting is about me."
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.240]   That's what he was saying.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.760]   "Fasting is about me."
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:24.200]   Longing so that the bridegroom will come.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.180]   That's why they don't fast 'cause I'm there with them.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.100]   But one day I will be taken away and then they will fast.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.780]   In 1 John 3, 2-3, "Beloved, now we are children of God
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.540]   "and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.500]   "We know that when he appears, we will be like him
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.220]   "because we will see him just as he is.
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.600]   "And anyone who has this hope fixed on him
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.460]   "purifies himself just as he is pure."
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:50.880]   They were so aware of this in the early church
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.120]   that in the old covenant, they would say, "Shalom, shalom.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.540]   "We're looking for the shalom of God."
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.200]   But the believers in the New Testament
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.240]   had a different greeting.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.340]   They say, "Maranatha, maranatha."
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.860]   And maranatha in Aramaic basically means Lord, come.
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.060]   That was their greeting.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.180]   They took this to heart.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.060]   They understood because the bridegroom has gone.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.860]   When Jesus ascended, all they could think about
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.580]   was one day we will be reunited with him.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:23.940]   And they fasted, they prayed, they obeyed,
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.860]   they gathered, they worshiped,
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.400]   all to eagerly wait for the coming of Christ.
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:35.060]   When our righteousness becomes anything less than that,
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.420]   it'll easily turn into self-righteousness.
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:42.240]   When every spiritual endeavor that we pour our energy into
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.900]   is not about a passionate pursuit of Christ,
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:51.420]   all your effort, just that little tweak,
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.920]   just that slight bit of,
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:58.160]   slight bit of pride,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.840]   turns all your effort into judgment,
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.280]   something ugly.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.740]   We're here to celebrate Christ.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.940]   We're here to celebrate Christ.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.740]   There's not a single person here
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.740]   that deserved any more than any other person in here
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.020]   by your own merit.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.180]   I don't care how long you prayed.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.260]   I don't care how many books you've read.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.680]   I don't care how many passages you've memorized.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.980]   There's not a single person in this room, including myself,
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.220]   that earned our way to have this relationship with Christ.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:38.460]   So he calls us, he calls us to continue to pursue him,
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.060]   continue to celebrate him, continue to long for him,
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.640]   that he may get the glory,
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.740]   and that our worship would simply be a reminder to us
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.800]   that he is coming, he is coming, Maranatha.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.780]   Let's pray.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.520]   (pages rustling)
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.600]   Let's take a minute to take some time to pray.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.740]   And let the word of God richly dwell in your hearts.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:14.300]   Ask the Lord that the word that you've heard
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.140]   would mold your heart and your very life,
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.980]   and allow the word of God to judge the thoughts
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.720]   and intentions of your heart.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.980]   Let's take some time to pray.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.880]   Again, as our worship team leads us.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:38.600]   (gentle piano music)
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.500]   (gentle piano music continues)

[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   Psalm 42, one through five.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   As the deer pants for the water brooks,
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   so my soul pants for You, O God.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   When shall I come and appear before God?
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   My tears have been my food day and night,
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.960]   while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   These things I remember, and I pour out my soul within me,
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   for I used to go along the throng
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.960]   and lead them in the procession to the house of God
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   with the voice of joy and thanksgiving,
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.960]   the multitude-keeping festival.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   Why are you in despair, O my soul?
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   And why have you become disturbed within me?
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.960]   Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.960]   for the help of His presence.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   Lord, we pray that the longing of our hearts, Lord God,
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   would be expressed as this psalmist does,
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   that as the deer pants for the waters,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.960]   my soul longs for You.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   I pray that You would help us to kindle that continued longing,
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   that we would seek You with all our heart,
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   and just as the early church did,
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   that we would desire Maranatha for You to come,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   that as our life is hidden with You,
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   that we would seek the things that are above
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   and set our mind, our hope, our heart,
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   not on temporary gains, but in eternity, Lord,
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   when You will come with reward.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   So for that end, I pray that wherever You send us,
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.960]   help us, Lord God, to be Your light.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.960]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
