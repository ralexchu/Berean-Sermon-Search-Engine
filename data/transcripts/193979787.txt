[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   We're going to jump right into the Bible study.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.240]   Today we're giving Pastor Peter a break from the leading worship part so you guys get double
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.640]   dose.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.880]   Well, I want to start off by doing it again of linking everything that we've been learning
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   again.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.120]   I've been doing it every time that I've been teaching just so that all that we are doing
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.960]   in terms of the outflow of how important the church and all that kind of stuff is flowing
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.240]   from the right place.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.640]   So walk with me here in the review and we'll put a bunch of blanks.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.920]   Now we learned that God is absolutely holy.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.560]   So we must have an accurately high view of God.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.360]   And remember I made it a kind of emphasis to say that just to say that, "Hey, we're
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.000]   going to have a high view of God," as in we're just going to try to elevate him, I felt like
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.980]   was not enough because the reality, what is true and real is that God actually is exalted.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.560]   And so we appropriately want to see him that way.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.040]   And then number two, we must have a corresponding high view of his word.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.520]   Think of it, it is really inconsistent when people regularly hold up their Bible and say,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.640]   "This is the word of God, word of God, word of God."
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.080]   And yet in terms of treating this, the scriptures and how they approach it, it is very far from
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.080]   reverential.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   It's very far from actually obedient.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.480]   So correspondingly, they have to be at high view of the word.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.720]   So Pastor Peter went at length about interpreting accurately.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.120]   So we have to have a corresponding high view of the word.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.240]   And then we have to make sure that we interpret the scriptures accurately.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.840]   That if we're not seeking to arrive at the intended meaning of the passage, then all
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.720]   you have is conjecture, opinion, and this and that.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.400]   But what's more, we obviously have to apply accurately by making sure that we go through
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   the right process of, "This is what the scripture says by exegesis."
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.760]   And only then do you ask historical theology, you know, systematic and then, or systematic
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.920]   historical and philosophical, right?
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.320]   So the whole idea there is, in terms of even the way that you're going to now place it
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.960]   into your life, that also has to be accurate as well.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.560]   Then we must have a high view of his church.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.160]   And we've been talking about that now for several weeks.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.200]   Firstly, we have to cherish the church as Christ does.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   Sorry I don't have the projection on there, but I'm going to repeat those blanks a couple
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.560]   times so you guys can follow along, okay?
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.600]   You have to cherish the church as Christ does.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.160]   What's more, we have to recognize God's delegated authority in the church.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   We did last week this idea of authority culturally.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.440]   Again, not for every single person, but especially here in the US, culturally, it stands in opposition
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280]   to what's normal, right?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.920]   But there's this question of, is there biblical delegated authority within the church?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.240]   And absolutely, absolutely.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.260]   Today, as we go down this flow of reviewing all that we've covered, we've covered these
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.200]   core doctrines that really stand as pillars for the church.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.680]   But today is going to be more of like a coaching and an inspiring and like a, "Ah, guys, let's
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.240]   do it," kind of day, okay?
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.040]   Because there's a sense in which we can talk about, again, this view of God.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.880]   We can talk about view of his word.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.080]   We talk about all his importance.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.220]   And up to that point, guess what?
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.840]   There's a sense in which it can remain theoretical, right?
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.040]   It can remain theoretical.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.160]   And so today we're going to be challenged to hear this admonition that we must align
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.420]   ourselves to his purposes then, right?
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.760]   Whatever God is doing then through his word, whatever God is doing then through his church,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.440]   we need to align ourselves with his purposes, okay?
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.560]   It's not enough to say the one thing, well, first of all, it's definitely not enough and
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.480]   absolutely wrong to have a misconstrued view of what God is doing so that the major problem
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.440]   in this day and age has been that people have been making the church what they want it to
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   be.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.480]   And people have been making the Bible say what they want it to say, right?
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.040]   And so the admonition that I'm saying is, if we're going to go down this line of saying,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.160]   well, God is holy and that's accurately what we see him as, then you need to submit to
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   his will.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.120]   If God's word is God's word and you have a high view of it, then you need to submit to
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   his word.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.240]   If God's church is cherished and it has authority, then we need to function underneath that as
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   well.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.840]   And so the whole challenge today is going to be there is a responsibility on us as members
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.320]   to buy into God's purposes and have a sense, this is my purpose, right?
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.920]   So that's what we're going to be talking about today.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.760]   And by way of kind of intro to say that, I mean, having a purpose statement for your
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.880]   life is really important.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.220]   If you've taken any business classes or even if you just read articles about like successful
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.200]   businesses or even just successful projects, they'll always say, number one is set the
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.240]   right goal, right?
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.360]   Have a mission statement.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.680]   And the reason why is because a mission statement pretty much explains why you exist.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.560]   It just answers the question like, what is this all for?
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   And I think that's really pertinent to us because we live in a generation where people
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.200]   are all searching for that kind of purpose.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.060]   People are always questioning for what reason am I here?
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.700]   Everybody does that at one point or another.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.120]   So was it without a mission statement, we're absolutely lost and without aim.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.400]   And what we're going to see is that regularly God has been very vocal about his purposes
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.240]   for mankind, his purposes for specific people, his purposes for nation, his purposes for
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.940]   collective body, right?
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.120]   And so what we're going to do right now, and I hope this doesn't become too boring for
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.280]   you guys, but we're going to do one of those like follow the trail, okay?
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.320]   Follow the trail of different characters to see God's purposes for them.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.040]   First we start off with Abraham.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.640]   So please turn your Bibles to Genesis chapter 12.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.020]   And we're going to be flipping obviously just a bunch of passages in the Old Testament and
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:07:00.920]   kind of, you know, again, following a theme.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.480]   That famous passage you guys are probably well versed in, it says, "Now the Lord said
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.200]   to Abraham, 'Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.520]   house to the land which I will show you and I will make you a great nation and I will
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.160]   bless you and make your name great and so you shall be a blessing.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.120]   And I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you I will curse and in you
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.200]   all the families of the earth will be blessed.'"
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.680]   Now you can read that in two different perspectives.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.440]   You can read that in one perspective of trying to figure out like, oh, who is that, you know,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.720]   the child or who's the nation?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.000]   What's the land and what's this blessing supposed to be?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.360]   And what you're doing is dissecting.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.200]   The other perspective you can take is a broad scope.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.800]   What is God doing?
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.400]   Right?
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.120]   And look at what he's saying when he says, you know, he's talking about like, "Go forth
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.080]   from your country, from your relatives," and he says, "the land which I will show you,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.640]   I will make you, I will bless you, I will bless you."
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:07.240]   And the whole repeated theme of that is God doing a mighty work calling Abraham.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.800]   Right?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.160]   So within that we have some of the blanks for you there.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.680]   Obviously the promises is the land.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.580]   Okay?
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.000]   This is just for your blinks.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.780]   We have the land, a great nation, and blessing.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.020]   Those three things you guys should have categorically in your head.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.880]   If you guys were here when Pastor Aaron was teaching through Genesis, which was an awesome
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.600]   series, he like drained that into our heads.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.060]   Like, because every week he, you know, reviewed that with us.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:43.120]   But it was great because as he explained it, those things by which God was desiring to
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.280]   give and what God had purposed actually built a framework of how to understand the Old Testament.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.580]   That was the meta-narrative by which we started to understand why.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.580]   Why was this happening?
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.580]   Why was that happening?
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.120]   And why are some of the stories even there?
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.740]   And so all I'm saying is it's important for us to recognize that there is a purpose of
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.980]   God by which he's working and building towards as he calls specific people.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.980]   So what's more, we think about even Moses, right?
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.740]   Moses has a purpose, a mission so to speak.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.220]   And Moses in Exodus chapter three, he is called, he says, "Therefore come now, I will send
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.380]   you to Pharaoh so that you may bring my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.620]   The blank there is deliverance.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:37.900]   God, in using Moses to draw his people, made that elaborate drama to make sure that the
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.140]   grandeur of his deliverance would be known throughout the generations, right?
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.020]   That it would not only simply be like, "Oh, it happened," but it would be something rehearsed.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.160]   It would be something memorized and it would be something reviewed so that the generations
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.020]   to come would recognize that God is a God of deliverance.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.740]   Okay?
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.740]   So what's more, if you turn your Bibles to Exodus chapter 25, verse one through nine,
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:11.740]   okay, God is working through Moses and he has these various purposes.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.740]   Okay.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:21.980]   Exodus chapter 25, verses one through nine.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.540]   And then he says, "Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, 'Tell the sons of Israel to
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.900]   raise a contribution for me.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.580]   From every man whose heart moves him, you shall raise my contribution.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.140]   This is the contribution which you are to raise from them.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:41.660]   Gold, silver, and bronze, blue, purple, and scarlet material, fine linen, go hair, ram
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:47.260]   skin dyed red, porpoise skins, acacia wood, oil for lighting, spices for the anointing
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.900]   of oil, and for the fragrant incense.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.100]   Onyx stones and setting stones for the ephod and for the breast piece.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.420]   Let them construct a sanctuary for me that I may dwell among them.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.940]   According to all that I am going to show you as the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.140]   of all its furniture, just so you shall construct it.'"
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.140]   Okay?
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:14.560]   And this is a really interesting passage because in God describing to Moses what he is going
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.300]   to do, he describes his intent, right?
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:25.140]   He says that, right there in verse 8, "Let them construct what a sanctuary for me, for
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.060]   what that I may dwell among them."
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.580]   If you missed that theme, if you missed that concept, what is God doing here?
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.740]   The rest of Exodus feels really bone dry.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.900]   It almost feels like you are picking up Ikea manual and just reading it for fun, right?
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.660]   And then you are just going to think, man, the Bible is super hard to read.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.300]   How many of you guys have read through Exodus and started realizing, my goodness, half the
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.300]   book.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.420]   Exodus is 40 chapters, but starting from chapter 25, the huge chunk of it is, this is what
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.780]   the clothes look like, this is what the altar looks like, this is what the lamp stand looks
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.780]   like, this is what the nation looks like, this is what the, you know what I'm saying?
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.380]   But here is the question, why?
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.620]   What is God doing?
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.800]   In his purpose, he desires to dwell with them.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:19.420]   So all the details and all the specifics that he is putting into, the measurement, and even
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.820]   the color, now all of a sudden has its place, right?
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.780]   And what's more, he describes how not only is he going to be doing this, he is going
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.260]   to use the people to contribute to do this.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.180]   So many of the chapters talks about, you know, skilled craftsmen, and then obviously you
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.020]   have that little episode with the golden calf and God is like, oh my goodness, right when
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.380]   I'm purposing, right when I'm intending to build this sanctuary so that I might dwell
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.620]   with you, this is what you do.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.820]   Pretty intense stuff.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.660]   My point being again though is, we want to have a perspective as we read the scriptures
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.580]   of asking the question, what is God's purpose?
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.380]   What is God's aim and goal?
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.300]   What's more, I want to ask you a question here, okay?
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.620]   With the priests of Leviticus, I'm going to ask you this question because I covered it
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.420]   week two, which was already a while ago, but just to refresh our memory, I made a big point
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.780]   about Leviticus chapter 16, okay?
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:38.180]   Who remembers what was the intent, what was the purpose of Leviticus chapter 16?
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.300]   I'll give you a hint, okay?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.980]   In the New Testament, Jesus is described as three things.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.900]   It's one of them.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.000]   Give you another hint.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.100]   My first son's middle name is this word I'm looking for.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:06.700]   Then Dan was like, that's not a hint.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   Okay?
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:14.900]   Remember that when God through the priests, all of a sudden in the book of Leviticus,
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.380]   start to give all these restrictions and all this kind of stuff, you might have been thinking,
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.820]   oh my gosh, right?
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.020]   All God is doing is restricting man from coming to him.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.540]   But I made the case that yes, it is a restriction because the reality is you can't.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.060]   But the purpose of establishing a priest and establishing a sacrifice was to show you the
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.940]   way, right?
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.580]   In chapter 16 of Leviticus, it made it very clear.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.540]   He said, I'm giving you a way.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.980]   The book of Leviticus, the purpose of it is to show them that there is going to be a way
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.980]   to God.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.980]   Why?
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.260]   Because currently you don't have one.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.660]   Currently right now, there's nothing for you.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.020]   You're separate from God and you dare not approach him for you shall die.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   That's reality.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.300]   The book of Leviticus is a grace.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.620]   That law is a grace given to them to give them a way to worship, to give them a way
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.380]   to approach.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.820]   What's God's purpose in that?
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.100]   Right?
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.140]   See if you missed that, all of a sudden, Leviticus chapter 19, the book of Leviticus becomes
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.420]   random laws, stuff that you just put aside as a bunch of ceremony.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.420]   So it's ceremonial stuff.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.420]   You just put it away, right?
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.980]   But that's not the case.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.900]   There's a purpose in which God is working.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.060]   What is God doing?
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.220]   Here's a little bit of a lengthier passage.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:43.580]   Please turn your Bible to 2 Samuel chapter 7.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:49.900]   Please turn your Bible to 2 Samuel chapter 7.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.940]   And this is in relation to King David.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:16:00.060]   2 Samuel 7 is known as the Davidic covenant passage.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.180]   I'm going to read you a little bit of a lengthy section, okay?
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.420]   This is what he says in verse 4 through 17.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.020]   He says, "But in the same night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, 'Go and
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.500]   say to my servant David, 'Thus says the Lord, you are the one who should build me a house
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   ...'" Sorry.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.700]   "'Are you the one who should build me a house to dwell in?
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.140]   For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought the sons of Israel from Egypt,
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.140]   even to this day.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.980]   But I have been moving about in a tent, even a tabernacle.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.980]   Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.760]   tribes of Israel, which I command to shepherd my people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.740]   built me a house of cedar?'
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:48.740]   Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'I took
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.060]   you from the pastor from following the sheep to be ruler over my people Israel.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.820]   I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.820]   you.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.140]   I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.340]   I will also appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.500]   live in their own place, and not be disturbed again.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.620]   Nor will the lewkid afflict them any more as formerly, even from the day that I commanded
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.880]   judges to be over my people Israel, and I will give you rest from all your enemies.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.780]   The Lord also declares to you that the Lord will make a house for you.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.940]   When your days are complete, and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.460]   after you, who will come from you, and I will establish his kingdom.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.580]   He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.020]   And I'm just going to stop there, okay?
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:47.620]   When you read these passages, you just get, I don't know if you get the same sense, but
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.240]   you just get a repetition of, "I will do this, I will do this, and this is what I'm going
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.020]   to do," right?
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.620]   And essentially, as you read these passages, what you realize is God has been working,
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.980]   God has been active, and he is accomplishing his purposes.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:12.100]   Whether it looks like it or appears like it in your eyes or not, it's happening.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.420]   What must we do?
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:20.940]   We have to align ourselves with the purposes of God.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:27.420]   Should any of these people say, "But I want to, how come I don't get to, but I so eagerly
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.420]   wanted to?"
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.100]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.940]   Then all of a sudden, even if whatever you desire seemed to be good in your eyes, now
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.220]   it becomes at odds with God.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:44.460]   Well, just to kind of fill in a couple more, all these significant individuals had a calling,
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:52.060]   a very specific calling, right, from God that was revealed very explicitly.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.120]   Now I'm not going to say that each and every single one of us has a calling explicitly
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.860]   like this, but there is a calling for us.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.140]   There absolutely is.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:10.100]   Now just kind of going down the line here, Ezra, he was commissioned with bringing reform,
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.100]   right?
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.900]   Bringing the wave of people back, putting away the idols.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.780]   He reprimanded everybody for their cross marriages with idolatrous people.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.780]   Nehemiah had the mission to rebuild the wall, right, to start rebuilding.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.660]   The prophets had a mission.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.660]   All these significant individuals had a mission.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:37.620]   Now, if you notice in your packet, I have a thing called common falling condition.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.820]   Common falling condition.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.860]   That's not originated from me.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.780]   This guy named Brian Chappell, he wrote a book called Christ-Centered Preaching and
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.460]   I stole it.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.180]   I call it the CFC and it just makes sense.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:20:00.220]   Whenever you see a kind of common phenomenon where we have this condition, you just call
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.540]   it this common falling condition where there is a sense, I believe, in this generation
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.300]   of an incredible frustration.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.820]   I don't know if you agree with me or not, or I don't know if you personally struggle
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.260]   with that right now.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.420]   There is a frustration in the heart of mankind in this generation and that frustration, I
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:27.460]   believe, comes from a sense of purposeless living.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.580]   I believe there is a reason why that purpose-driven life phenomenon happened.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.660]   Why millions and millions of people read a book where many pastors previous to him said
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.020]   the exact same thing, but they soaked it up.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.020]   Why?
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.700]   Because there was a big, big vacancy of a sense of purpose in their lives.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:54.860]   And I think, even if I look at my life, sometimes I get so myopic that I look at my table, my
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.380]   lot in life, and I start to ask this question like, "Why?
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.980]   What is this?
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.460]   What for?"
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.940]   So I just want to share a little bit of a story here, or I just want to share a little
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.740]   bit of examples.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.660]   I think there are times, let's say even starting from young age, like high school, high school
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.740]   students are striving for stuff, whether it be first experiences of going to dances or
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.340]   whatever, or high school students are looking for that acceptance letter from their college.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:30.060]   I'm going to be honest with you, I think I've shared this story with you guys many times,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.500]   but I as a high school student had my heart set on going to UCSD.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.180]   For those of you guys who went there, consider yourselves blessed, okay?
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.700]   When I got my little small rejection letter, I was so sad I cried.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.940]   I started crying and my parents were like, "What is it?"
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.060]   I did one of those like, "We don't want to talk about it," and just like went to my room.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.700]   Did you know that I appealed four times?
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.300]   And by the fourth one, they wrote me back and said, "Please stop.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.780]   We're not accepting your appeal letters."
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.060]   And then at my church where I got saved, we had one of these farewell banquets for the
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.660]   seniors and stuff, and then I was like, "No farewell.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.940]   I don't want to go to this stupid party."
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.740]   I was so bummed because I had my hopes set on that acceptance letter.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.620]   But what happens?
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.340]   You know exactly what happens.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.060]   After that, you get embittered and then you're just like, "Whatever," and you give up.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.020]   So I remember when I came to UCI, I didn't go to SPOP.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.740]   SPOP is the orientation week.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.140]   I didn't go to the dorms and check it out.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.900]   I didn't even register for my classes.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.980]   Once I got to UCI, actually James Hong might have helped me register for classes because
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.100]   I didn't do it.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.100]   I was so devastated.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.980]   I was just like, "Whatever.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.500]   I don't care."
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.220]   That happens even in high school.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:48.700]   And then collegians, there's a sense in which sometimes when they're studying and when they're
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.780]   trying to pick certain majors, maybe they bomb their first exam, whatever it may be,
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:59.420]   all of a sudden disappointment leads to being jaded and leads to a sense of like, "Why?"
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.260]   And then there are people who are working.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.020]   Even if you have a decent job, it's repetitive.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.260]   And then you start asking, "Why?"
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.300]   Just for the fact, not because it's hard, not because it's demeaning, but it's because
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.620]   it's repetitive and because it's mundane.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.700]   And then you start asking the question, "Why?
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.700]   Is this it?
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.700]   Isn't there more?"
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.260]   And I have people ask me regularly, "When I think of Christian life, sometimes I don't
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.820]   get very excited here.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.140]   What is that supposed to look like?
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.540]   It looks really dry."
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.220]   As a matter of fact, I don't know.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.060]   It just seems so uninspiring.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.620]   There's got to be more.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.900]   So I don't know if maybe some of you guys can relate to all of that, but I think in
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.460]   this generation, there are so many people who struggle with that.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460]   Why?
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:53.460]   Did you know that if you look up psychiatric studies of how many people are depressed in
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:00.060]   this generation, it is above the generation of World War I?
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.340]   Which is baffling.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:08.360]   That the number of people who say they have clinical depression exceeds those individuals
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.060]   during the time of World War I.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.060]   Why?
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.260]   Because I think people wrestle with this idea of there is absolutely no purpose for that.
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.020]   My own personal struggle with that.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:27.780]   I remember when I first became Christian, the very first song that I learned was, I'm
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.580]   not going to sing it, but the words go, "Here I am, nothing much to give.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.300]   Here I am, asking for the privilege to be used by you.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.780]   Use me, dear Lord, use me, dear Lord."
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.740]   It was a simple song, three chords, and I learned it and I sang it again and again and
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   again.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.700]   And it came from when I first got saved, I wanted to be used.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:53.860]   But what was really interesting is after graduating college, I was a philosophy major, completely
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.300]   useless.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.980]   And then I worked for a year and a half, and I did really odd jobs.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.740]   And then I decided I want to go to seminary because I want to be used.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.020]   I went through four years of seminary and then finished.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.380]   Now I was still really active at church.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   Whoa, the light.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.100]   I was still doing a bunch of stuff, right?
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.680]   But there was still this question of, where do I fit?
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.060]   There was a question of, what's my role?
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.780]   There was a question of, I don't even know what my gifts are.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.280]   I'm going to be honest with you, I don't know what my gifts are in terms of what am I really
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.620]   good at.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.220]   Maybe I can do this, maybe I can do that.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.300]   I feel like I can do this, but I don't even know what is a tangible gift I should be doing
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.100]   right now.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.500]   So in all those questions, guess what?
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.740]   I started feeling a sense of that, like, what do I do?
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.820]   What is this all for?
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:50.100]   And I remember asking this question, God, what do I get to do?
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:56.940]   And then I remember feeling incredibly rebuked because as I studied the scriptures, I didn't
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.820]   hear a, well, what you get to do is, right?
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.260]   Well, actually, let me put it this way.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.460]   The questions that I was asking, it's not necessarily wrong, but the heart behind it
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:12.220]   could be very dangerous because although God's answer might be the same, the questions are
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.220]   entirely different.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.980]   What do I mean by that?
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.580]   There are times because of our hearts, the common fallen condition.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.900]   How many of you guys have ever sat in your wardrobe, maybe in front of your closet and
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:31.100]   you sit there and you're like, oh, I've got nothing to wear.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.340]   Your clothes are like falling off.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.660]   Everything's like so packed.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.780]   You can't even squeeze your shirt in, but you're like, oh, I've got nothing to wear.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.780]   Right?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.460]   What we mean is there's nothing there I want to wear.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460]   Right?
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.740]   And it's just like my kids.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.900]   We've got that little train table that we got from their cousins and then they're all
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.900]   playing.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   They're playing with each other.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.620]   And then obviously the older one, he's stronger and bigger.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.620]   So it's like, I don't want to play with that.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.620]   And he grabs it.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:59.220]   And my little one's sitting there like, and then his table is all like empty on his side.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.700]   And then he looks at me, I've got nothing, you know?
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.940]   And I'm like, just turn around.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.540]   You have like a four by four Ikea shelf with all these toys, you know?
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.500]   But of course, when you look at in front of them, what do you have?
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   Nothing.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.740]   What do I get to play with?
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:22.580]   When you have so much more on a larger perspective, I wondered at that moment, I got, felt so
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.700]   rebuked because I'm sitting here asking, what's my role?
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.700]   What's my gift?
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.100]   What do you have planned for me?
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.220]   When God's probably sitting there asking me, did you notice what I was doing?
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.620]   Did you notice what I was working towards?
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.620]   Right?
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:44.620]   Did you know how I, you know, have you been paying attention to what I've been building?
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.180]   Did you have eyes like Ezra to see there's like broken wall?
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.980]   Did you have eyes like Nehemiah to see there's idolatry over there?
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.340]   Have you been paying attention to my plans?
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.980]   And then I felt this weight of rebuke because you study the scriptures and Jesus Christ
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.900]   is saying over and over again, here in the New Testament, all the things that we went
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.620]   through, choosing a chosen nation and a people who will be blessed, that is in Christ, the
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:16.300]   church through Moses, the deliverance, through Moses, the tabernacle of the spirit of God
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.300]   dwells.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.620]   That's the church, the building of the temple, so to speak.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.180]   This is the church.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:28.020]   And Jesus Christ has been saying in this generation, I will build my church.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.420]   And that's when I started to feel this like burden on my soul.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.260]   Like God is telling me, build his church.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.940]   And that's why I'm all about building the local church.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.920]   Because in a moment of kind of feeling lost, in a moment of feeling like I don't know my
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:50.600]   niche in life, I really felt from the scriptures that God was saying that in this time he is
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:57.060]   truly building a body of people, which I am to help build.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.460]   Let's look at some of these passages.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.140]   Okay.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:07.100]   Matthew chapter 16, verses 13 through 20.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.740]   Matthew chapter 16, verse 13 through 20.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.300]   Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked the disciples, who do people
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.660]   say that the Son of Man is?
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.940]   And they said, some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.340]   one of the prophets.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.220]   He said to them, but who do you say that I am?
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.860]   And Simon Peter replied, you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.220]   And Jesus answered him, blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.860]   this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.540]   And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.460]   of hell shall not prevail against it.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.020]   I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on it shall
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.860]   be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on it shall be loosed in heaven.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.940]   Think about that.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.780]   Who revealed that truth to Peter?
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.140]   God.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.140]   So who's at work?
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.140]   God.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.220]   Who is going to build this church?
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.500]   Christ.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   And what is God doing?
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.700]   He is giving such authority to the church.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.700]   What's more, Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14, 12, so also you, since you are zealous
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.300]   for spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification of the church.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.580]   In the New Testament, God is establishing the church.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:36.300]   And so, if you are feeling a sense of, I don't know, Christian life in the OC, so lame.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.620]   I feel like maybe you're looking at the wrong plate.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.900]   You're looking at the wrong table.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.060]   Maybe your eyes were focused in on like, I wanted Christian life in OC to maybe look
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.180]   like this.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.500]   And since you see a gaping hole there, you're like, man, this is lame.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.700]   Let us today, I want to encourage us, again, today is kind of like, let's get inspired
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:04.700]   to broaden our perspective and ask, what is God doing here, right now, in OC, in your
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.300]   life?
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.500]   And what visions and purposes of God can you attach yourself to?
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.740]   Not simply to say, God, what's my niche going to be, right?
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.620]   And I want to be able to do something that I can look back and say, wow, look at the
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.620]   way God used me.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.620]   No.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:26.380]   What is God doing by which you can align yourselves and get behind that and serve those purposes?
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.380]   That's the question.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.700]   Because God is doing much.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.220]   You look at all the things that the scripture is said in Ephesians, the passage in 2, chapter
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:40.100]   2, verse 19 to 20, that's the one that talks about this, that in Christ, yes, he is the
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.300]   chief cornerstone and we are being the structure joined together, grows into a holy temple
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.300]   in the Lord.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:53.700]   In him, you also are being built up together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.660]   First Peter, chapter 2, verse 4 through 5, as you come to him, a living stone rejected
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.660]   by man, but in the sight of God chosen and precious.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.140]   You yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.340]   priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:18.460]   Did God expect you to have a mundane, I don't quote unquote lame kind of life in this generation?
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.780]   No.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:25.060]   He actually expects us to be responsible, active, productive, contributing, offering
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.660]   up spiritual sacrifices.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.700]   There's so much.
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.420]   There's so much.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:36.140]   So you guys can look up those passages in your own time, but right now what we're going
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.600]   to do is we've given the big picture.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.860]   The big picture is there are purposes of God for the church that we need to buy into.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.220]   The smaller things and the details we're going to do now.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:54.220]   So therefore, therefore, and we're just going to do like a machine gun style, machine gun
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.740]   style application, kind of envisioning what we can be doing.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:05.160]   This is also going to be review, review of our membership covenant.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:13.820]   So number one, if we believe that the spirit of God dwells not in 314A4 Airway Avenue,
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.500]   building A, but the dwelling of God is the church, the people, the dwelling of God is
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.300]   in your heart through faith, right?
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.180]   Then the first thing we need to do is make sure that we're building this church the appropriate
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.580]   way and that you're contributing to the building up of the strength of this church by solidifying
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.860]   your faith.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.100]   The blank there is solidifying your faith.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.460]   What do I mean by that?
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:43.340]   It is your responsibility to examine your faith and solidify it by which if you have
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.780]   any question, am I really saved?
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.380]   That's for you to examine.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:55.180]   If you have any doubt, man, I grew up in the Christian church and then I've been telling
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:00.140]   people I've been Christian since I was a baby, but I can't really pinpoint a time when I
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.700]   repented.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.940]   That's something you need to deal with.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.580]   If you feel like, you know, right now there are days, not just days, but weeks and not
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.300]   just weeks, but months, I have no desire for God.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   Where am I?
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.660]   That's for you to discern, right?
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.940]   Because truthfully speaking, the leaders and the people around you, they can't tell you,
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.820]   "No, you're a Christian."
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.820]   Why?
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.340]   They can't look into your heart.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:35.020]   They can't, I actually don't ever really tell people, "Don't you ever doubt and don't you
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.060]   ever worry because you're a Christian."
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.340]   Because I don't know their heart.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.860]   What I do typically is ask them questions.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.820]   Do you feel conviction?
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.980]   Remorse?
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.980]   So I ask questions.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.540]   So maybe you can, and again, that's your responsibility to search for what kind of questions should
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.140]   I ask to solidify my faith?
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.860]   Now the church has a responsibility.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:01.220]   We practice membership, so there is in a sense a door.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:08.900]   But that door is crossed by confession and that confession is yours to make.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.660]   For you to examine your faith to the degree that you will have a definitive conclusion,
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.300]   a definitive conclusion towards confession, "I believe it.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   I believe it.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   I trust it.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.700]   I am saved by the grace of God."
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.380]   That's your responsibility, right?
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.580]   That's not in the power of another person to tell you.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:36.500]   So number one was this idea that you have to have a definitive conclusion.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.540]   Do you have that?
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.420]   And that's for your responsibility.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:48.140]   And so therefore, we have as our membership covenant number one, which is, oh sorry, this
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:55.740]   motion means that you guys would say it, who remembers, we should put that on the quiz
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.740]   too.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.060]   List the 10 commitments of, you know, just kidding.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:05.980]   The BCC quiz is pretty intense already.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.460]   I confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.940]   And that's something we have people sign off on as their commitment.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.660]   Isn't that weird?
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.820]   It's a commitment of faith.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.940]   It's a commitment of solidifying that confession.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.340]   I have my confession in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.260]   So I have a little section for ideas.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:37.180]   Take 30 seconds to jot down some ideas of how this is something that you can apply to
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.780]   build a church.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.140]   That's interesting.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:47.660]   I'm asking you to take the concept of solidifying, as in making sure that you have the assurance
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:52.140]   of salvation and use that by way of building the church.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.780]   What is this idea?
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.780]   What's that idea?
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.220]   It doesn't have to be so linearly connected, like this is how we build it.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.660]   But ideas.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:10.700]   Just jot it down real fast.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.140]   And I'll help you with some.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:20.300]   You know, maybe if you don't have the capacity, you know, maybe you're a newer Christian and
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:28.020]   you can't verbally express the gospel, starting to memorize that, rehearse it, right?
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:34.180]   Maybe not just because someone asked you, but reviewing your testimony to see if there
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:42.340]   have been clear actual experience of being converted in Christ.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.060]   Idea of asking certain questions.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.660]   Maybe even if you've been a long time Christian and one of our college students comes to you
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:57.980]   and says, "I just came from this youth group and we've never really heard the gospel, so
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:01.620]   to speak, the gospel proper, but I know I'm a pretty good, like I know I'm a Christian
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.020]   because I believe, but like, how do I know?"
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.940]   Do you know how to answer that?
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:13.420]   So learning how to guide somebody through like an assurance of their conversion.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:17.060]   So these are all things that you can be doing because then you're going to be equipped to
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.060]   build a church.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.220]   There are more, but you guys can, you know, jot those ideas down.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   Okay.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.700]   I'm going to have to probably go faster because we're going to be here for a long night.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.020]   Okay.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:35.660]   Number two, it's your responsibility to build a church by continuing to learn and renew
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.860]   your mind.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.340]   Okay.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.380]   So continuing to learn and renew your mind.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.800]   You being a theologian actually builds the church.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.820]   You studying the scriptures diligently and meditating upon it is building the church.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.820]   What's more, when we have services, because these are the main avenues of our gathering,
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.820]   right?
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.740]   When we have the preaching of the word of God, my question to you would be, are you
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.420]   getting the most out of the sermons and the lessons?
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.920]   Are you an active listener?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.620]   Are you sitting back, enjoying the lesson and saying, "That felt pretty good," and
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.620]   leaving?
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.420]   Or are you actively listening, trying to retain and trying to apply?
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.140]   Are you basically taking the inductive methodology that you use to when you do your own Bible
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.660]   study and apply it to your own listing of the scriptures whenever you hear it?
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.220]   Do you realize that this actually continues to build the church as we all collectively
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.220]   learn together?
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.220]   Right?
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:40.300]   And what's more, I ask the question of, are you continuing to renew your mind?
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.460]   Because honestly speaking, the church, I don't know if you guys see it, but I see it a lot
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.460]   with the collegians.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.460]   Okay.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.820]   I see it a lot with the collegians because I feel like, my goodness, every year we're
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.220]   going to have to deal with this.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   I'm teaching this lesson on Friday with the collegians.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.420]   I went over one of the lessons, immediately one of the students came up and was like,
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.420]   "I still don't get it.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.420]   Why the church?
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.980]   Like, if I want to not come, why do I have to?"
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.380]   And it feels very, what, legalistic.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:13.060]   I'm like, "Okay, we're going to have to go through this every time, every year, because
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.580]   the massive generation of people that are coming up don't have a base foundation of
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.020]   like, this is the role of the church in their Christian lives."
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.660]   Even when it comes to what's pure and what's impure, what's acceptable for a Christian
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.740]   and what's not acceptable.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.820]   That line, obviously we don't draw like crystal clear in the cement or whatever, but those
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.820]   lines have to be drawn.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:41.780]   But do you realize that this generation, this church is also under attack?
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.460]   The muddying of those lines so that you can't say any of that stuff.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.060]   And I see it readily in the collegians.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.640]   I see it in the, especially in the young group.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.140]   So I just want to ask the question of, is your mind being renewed?
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.900]   And again, we have a membership covenant that says, "I confess that the Bible is an inerrant
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:04.000]   word of God and has ultimate authority over my life."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So what am I doing here?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.980]   Is that I'm presenting to you our membership commitments.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.460]   In one perspective, it's just simply your commitment to the church.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.100]   In another perspective, these are various things that you can commit to so that you
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.760]   can be a healthy member, a healthy Christian.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.420]   And these are many of the things that you can be devoting your time to.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:28.140]   Do we expect every Christian to be a studious individual?
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.620]   Yes.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:35.500]   Even if you're a super slow reader, even if you don't normally read books, yes, you should.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.660]   You should read the scriptures.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:44.420]   You should be reading topical books on church, topical books on current issues.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.100]   Now I'm not saying that you have to be at a certain level.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:54.500]   You don't all have to be like somebody else, but you should all be readily growing.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.340]   Take a moment to jot down.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:03.460]   If you personally have not been renewing your mind to the scriptures, if you personally
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:09.240]   have been really inactive and deficient in learning and gaining perspective and answering
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:15.060]   some of the pertinent questions, how can you address that?
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.560]   Because that's your responsibility.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.700]   And the perspective that we want to instill in everybody again is, as you grow in that
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:27.140]   kind of theology, the conviction from the Bible, that contributes to the health of the
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.300]   church because your health, whether you get swayed left and right, is the health of the
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.020]   church.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.380]   Your personal conviction is going to contribute to the collective whole.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.100]   So write down some ideas.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:49.060]   Maybe you guys have never tackled that gigantic, grudum, systematic theology.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.380]   Now we don't all have to go through it by the end of the year or whatever, but we recommend
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.380]   it.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.380]   Why?
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.380]   Because it's going to give you a base.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.580]   Is every single thing in that book correct and right?
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.380]   You have to test it against scripture.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.380]   Right?
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.980]   Okay, so anyway, ideas, write it down.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.460]   How do we have tangible ideas?
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.220]   Reading plans, journals, recommended books.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.460]   We're going to try to establish a library.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.580]   Okay?
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.980]   I'm not going to go through all 10, but I'm going to kind of lump the next couple.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.700]   Next, build a church by fervently praying.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.940]   Okay?
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.460]   It is your responsibility to build this church by praying your heart out.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.220]   Here's an interesting idea that I have.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.380]   I want to say to you guys is this, oh, wait a minute.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.380]   Do I have blanks?
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.380]   Aw, there's supposed to be blanks.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.380]   Okay.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.380]   All right.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.420]   Well, build a church, that's interesting how that worked, by fervently praying.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.420]   Okay?
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.180]   Here's a passage in Ephesians chapter six.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.340]   Praying always with all prayers and supplication in the spirit.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.020]   Praying always should be enough, but redundantly, he says, pray always with every kind of prayer
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.540]   and supplications too.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.700]   You know?
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.700]   For what?
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.700]   And watch with all perseverance, supplications for the saints and for me that utterance may
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:11.900]   be given to me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.420]   Okay?
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.420]   It's really interesting.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.940]   I don't know if you guys have ever heard it, but I have heard people say something like,
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:22.020]   you know, there was a large portion where I thought like the vast majority of needs
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.060]   in the church were met.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   You know?
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.700]   We are thankful that many people do serve at our church.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.360]   But number one, no, not all the needs at the church are met.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.500]   Do you feel like all the needs of the church are met?
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.580]   But number two, even if you feel like, yeah, but where is there a tangible place for me
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.580]   to serve?
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   Okay?
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.580]   I'm just going to get real specific.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.580]   Someone said, there's nothing tangible to serve except cleaning and snacks.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.340]   I don't want to do either.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.860]   My thing is this, is like, what if we just asked you, the biggest need we have is for
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.020]   you to just pray?
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.380]   You know?
