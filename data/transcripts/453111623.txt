[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.420]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 10, we're going to be focused
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.860]   on verses 24 and 25 this morning, but we want to read it in the context that we were at.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.880]   Remember, we were at the end of the inclusio, this kind of meant to be an exclamation mark
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.360]   of the text that we were in, starting from chapter 4. Remember, an inclusio is something
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.860]   that starts with the same phrase and ends with the same phrase, and so it was meant
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.480]   to be taken as a unit, and so we're at the end of that, and so we're going to be looking
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.840]   at verse 19. I'm going to read from 19 to 25, but focused on 24 and 25. Okay? Again,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.320]   reading out of the NASB, "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000]   place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.440]   the veil, that is his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.240]   let us draw near with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.080]   sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water, let us
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.040]   hold fast a confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.880]   own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another in all the
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.480]   more as you see the day drawing near." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we ask for your guidance,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.040]   we ask for your Holy Spirit to open our ears, help us to understand and apply the very things
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.120]   that you have for us. May this time be pleasing in your sight, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.240]   Alright, so as I mentioned, that this is the end part of the inclusio where he, it was
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   meant to be taken as an exclamation mark of all the things that he's been saying about
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.800]   what Jesus has done. And this is at the backbone, this is at the core of what you and I profess
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   to believe. And so we are not to take this lightly, we are to take it seriously because
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.440]   of what it leads to. So the point of all that he's been saying, the author has been saying,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.760]   is not simply, "Do you understand who Jesus is?" That wasn't his ultimate goal. His ultimate
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.280]   goal is, "If you understand who he is, then how will you live?" And his primary concern
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.080]   wasn't a lack of Christology, even though that was the root cause of them drifting.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   His primary concern was people were beginning to drift out of the church and go back and
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.200]   revert back to their old life. And he recognized the reason why is because maybe they forgot
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.040]   who Jesus is, or they needed to be reminded the supremacy of Christ, that he is above
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.960]   everything that they're being tempted to drift back to. And so that's why he took all this
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.120]   time going over details of who Jesus is, that he's greater than the angels, greater than
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.680]   Moses, greater than the prophets, greater than the sacrificial system. He himself is
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.080]   the sacrifice. He himself is the high priest. And as a result of that, he says, there's
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.400]   three imperatives. And these imperatives are not unique to this text. In fact, every imperative
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   in the New Testament will fall into these three categories, drawing near to God, persevering,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.160]   and reaching out to others. And the way that I phrased it last week was reach up, reach
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.680]   in, and reach out. So every imperative, every doctrine of Christ, every doctrine of the
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.920]   gospel leads to one of these applications, that we are to draw near to God, to persevere
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   in our faith, and to reach out to other people. So last week, we looked at drawing near to
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.080]   God and to persevere, to hold fast to our confession, right? And so, and it needs to
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.760]   be in that order. Because if we draw strength from reaching out to other people, and that's
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.400]   our primary reason why we do what we do, eventually, you're going to get burnt out. If your primary
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.680]   feeding and energy is coming from serving other people, eventually, when people disappoint
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.040]   you, you will also burn out as well. That's not where we're supposed to get our sustenance.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.300]   That's the application of the sustenance that we get from Christ. And so the first order
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.720]   of things that God teaches us always is to draw near to Christ. Where are you with Christ?
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.840]   Not just theologically, right? Not just do you have the right answers, but are you walking
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.160]   with Christ? Are you communion with Christ? Can you say that you are in love with Christ?
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.640]   Is, is having intimate communion with Christ your primary pursuit in life? And secondly,
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.960]   if that's the case, are you persevering? Are you swerving? Are you being distracted by
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.040]   the things that are going on around you? Are you running to other people for sustenance?
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.960]   Is Christ your center? And are you not swerving? Are you persevering in that? And only those
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.240]   people who are being fed and strengthened in Christ, we can be led to the third application,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.680]   which is to reach out. And this is so important because it gets to the core of why we gather,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.840]   why we're sitting in the hot sun doing what we're doing. Because especially right now,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.440]   you know, the churches are debating one another back and forth online and even among pastors,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.840]   maybe even among your friends. Why are you going, why are you, why is your church gathering
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.120]   together? Now, why can't we just stay online? What's the big deal? Why is your church so
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.800]   worried about this? And there's a back and forth going on between the churches that are
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.260]   open with the churches that aren't open as to if this is necessary or not necessary.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.460]   And so all the more why this text is so important for us this morning, because it has, it has
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.880]   direct application of what's happening. So I want to jump in this morning, as he says
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.920]   to let us draw near to Christ, let us hold fast to our confession. And then third and
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.940]   finally, let us consider, let us consider how to stimulate one another toward love and
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.560]   good deeds. The first thing I want to look at is to let us consider, to consider carefully
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.640]   contemplate, to deliberately think about, you know, in Hebrews chapter 3, 1, the letter
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:00.360]   started by challenging us to consider Jesus. Partakers of heavenly calling consider Jesus
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.280]   the apostle and high priest of our confession. Right? So let's, let's take our minds of all
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.880]   of our distractions and think about who Jesus is. And that's how the letter started. And
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.200]   so now at the end of this inclusio, this doctrinal part of the, of the Bible, of the book of
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.860]   Hebrews, now he says, now that we have considered Christ, let us consider carefully how to stimulate
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.560]   other people. Let us consider how we are going to provoke and stimulate other people. Now,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.280]   this is so important because again, you and I live in a generation where we just don't
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.440]   think. We don't have time or space to think, you know, and sometimes I think maybe I'm
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.760]   just getting old, but you know, I go to coffee shops and I just can't hear myself. You know,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.640]   the music is blasted, you know, you're in the car and then the car is blasting, you're
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.160]   by yourself and the phone is on. So there's very little time to actually sit down and
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.280]   contemplate. You're almost constantly being told what to think and what to feel. And that
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.760]   we may not be doing that deliberately, but our society around us, it created an environment
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.600]   where we don't sit and contemplate and think through deep things. We just go from one thought,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.200]   one entertainment, one show, one clip, just one blog, you know, one, and we just go from
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.240]   one to another. The very first thing we are told to do, he says, to consider carefully,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.080]   to think through, contemplate. You know, as sinners who've been saved by the grace of
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:40.800]   God, our natural inclination is to be self-centered. What about me? What is God doing for me? What
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.040]   are they doing for me? Are they reaching out to me? When we are me-centered, it naturally
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:54.200]   leads to ingratitude. It naturally leads to ingratitude. It naturally leads to discontent
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.520]   because other sinners don't live up to your desires because they're also sinners, because
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.420]   they're also thinking the same thing, because they're also self-centered. So if you have
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.900]   a room filled with self-centered people, if you're sitting next to a self-centered person,
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.440]   that person is probably thinking the exact same thing that you're thinking. Why is that
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:19.480]   guy not reaching out to me? Why does that guy not care about me? So our natural inclination
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:27.000]   when we are self-centered is to think about how everything around them affects me. And
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.680]   we naturally become judgmental if that's the case. In Matthew 7, verse 3, it says, "Why
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.400]   do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.520]   your own eye?" Why do you look at the speck that is in your own eye? Look meaning that
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.280]   you're examining other people to see what's wrong with them, and you're so gracious to
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:52.520]   yourself, but so critical toward other people. That's usually the result of being self-centered.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.640]   Galatians 6, "Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.080]   restore such a one in the spirit of gentleness, each one looking to yourself." In other words,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.280]   examine yourself carefully so that you too will not be tempted. Apostle Paul says in
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.200]   1 Corinthians 8, 12, "Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.120]   again so that I will not cause my brother to stumble." In other words, he says, "I
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.720]   have the freedom. I can eat this meat. I can eat that food." He says, "But his life isn't
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:31.440]   about just himself." A self-centered person always stops with, "I'm okay with it. I have
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.960]   the freedom. Don't judge me." But Apostle Paul says, "I have the freedom." But he says,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.560]   "But if my actions cause someone else to stumble, his life standard is not himself. It's about
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.080]   how his life is lived for the sake of other people." Now again, in 1 Corinthians 9, 22-23,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.600]   "To the weak I became weak that I might not, I might win the weak. I have become all things
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.640]   to all men so that I may by all means save some. I do all things for the sake of the
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.600]   gospel so that I may become a fellow partaker of it." Even though he was free, he's the
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.060]   one who teaches us about the freedom that we have in Christ. He's the one who argues
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.320]   against the Judaizers who's saying that you have to do this on the Sabbath and you, you
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.120]   have to do this and you have to do that. And he says, "If you want to compare credentials
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.480]   of who's the greatest legalist," he says, "I can outdo all of you." So he's the one who
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.640]   teaches us about the freedom in Christ and yet he says he does, he does all things for
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.200]   the sake of other people. The first and foremost thing that we are called to do, if there is
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.040]   any affection in Christ, if we've been affected by the gospel in any way, he says first and
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.960]   foremost, what does he say in Philippians chapter 2? Right? "Do nothing out of selfishness,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:50.040]   of self-centeredness. Consider others better than yourselves," he says. And so that we
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.800]   may live our lives not in us-centered but in other-centered. Again in Romans 12, 15,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.480]   after 11 chapters of teaching us about the intricate details of the gospel, the application
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.760]   that we saw, remember when we're going through Romans chapter 12, 15, it says, "Rejoice with
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.240]   those who rejoice and weep with those who weep." See the problem with a self-centered
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.720]   life is we don't even know who's rejoicing. We don't know who's weeping. Other than our
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.440]   immediate friends, other than the few people that we've allowed into our circle, we can't
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.400]   weep with those people because we just, we've never cared beyond our, our, our little bubble.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.760]   So we don't know who's rejoicing. And then it's like, oh, when we see it online, it's
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.280]   like, oh, how come I'm not invited to that? Oh, we're not in their circle. And we're not
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.520]   able to weep with other people because we don't know what's going on in their lives
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:47.240]   because we've lived in our little bubble, because we've lived in a self-centered life.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:53.960]   You can't practice church online. You can't practice church online because you will never
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.180]   know what's going on in people's lives. If your whole Christian life is about you listening
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.800]   to a sermon and dropping off your offering, if that's your whole idea of Christianity,
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   yes, you can do that online. But what the church is called to do to consider how to
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.960]   stimulate one another on toward love and good deeds, you can't do that from a distance because
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.620]   you don't know what's going on in people's lives. So first and foremost, the imperative
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:27.880]   that he calls us to do is to think and contemplate who are in need, who, who needs to be encouraged,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:34.240]   who needs to be provoked. Church was never meant to be practiced from a distance. So
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.840]   the first thing he says, let us consider carefully contemplate deliberately. What are we to do
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.980]   to consider stimulate one another on toward love and good deeds? You know, this word for
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.140]   stimulate in Greek is a very strong word. In fact, the closest word to English would
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:56.160]   be to provoke, to provoke. When we think of provoke, at least the way we use it in our
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.940]   language is, is usually negative, right? Somebody is always doing irritating things and you
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:09.400]   get provoked, right? If you have younger siblings at home, right? Your older siblings, you know,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   say your younger siblings, you'll say, oh, he does and she, what she does provokes me,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.160]   right? In other words, if you're provoked to anger, maybe you have road rage, somebody
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.340]   cuts you off and you just instantaneously you're provoked. So when somebody is provoked,
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.400]   it's not calculated. It just happens. Someone else's behavior, someone, what someone else
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.720]   is doing causes a very intense, strong emotions to come out. That's the word provoke when
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.840]   it is used in a negative way. Here's it's used in a positive sense to provoke that our
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:51.880]   behavior, what we say and do causes another person to be provoked to love almost involuntarily.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.980]   If you've ever been around people like that, who they're just life is just constantly in
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.340]   serving other people. You just automatically become more serving. You understand? Do you
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.140]   know what I'm talking about? Right? I would say like as a group of people, and this may
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:11.680]   not be true of every single mother, but as a group of people, I think moms generally
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.340]   are just serving is embedded into their lives because that's what, that's what they just
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:22.500]   do. I don't know if you've ever been at a dinner party with a bunch of moms, biggest
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.220]   feast ever, right? Because that's, they just do that. They just, it's just embedded. They
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.580]   don't have to think twice. They get together. They're almost fighting each other to do dishes.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.020]   They're fighting each other to clean up. You know, that don't happen in most crowds. When
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.540]   the dads are gathered together, we're usually just tired. You know, when moms are together,
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.060]   they're like fighting each other to serve. And there are people, there's groups of people,
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:51.220]   there are people that if you're around them, you just naturally are provoked by their actions
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.140]   to be more serving, to be more generous, to be more giving. That's the idea that he has
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:02.820]   here to provoke. Now, I could say that every Sunday, my desire is to provoke you with my
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.260]   words and there is a place for that. And I think it's very important because the word
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:16.380]   of God, when we hear it, it provokes us to action. But for most of us, you know, the
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:24.020]   provoking happens through action. Usually action begets other action. You know, our
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:31.660]   church is run by volunteers, right? And so things are not done professionally. It's not
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.320]   done professionally because people are not getting paid to do that. Now, we have the
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.220]   finances to hire maybe five or six more full-time staff, maybe five or six part-time staff,
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.700]   and we can get a full-time janitor, we can get a full-time, you know, like whatever.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.060]   And we have the finances that we could do that. But part of the reason why we don't
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:57.540]   do that is because we want to give the opportunity for the church to serve. And so as long as
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.420]   it is being run by volunteers, there's different levels of maturity. There are some people
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:08.140]   who will volunteer and they are very faithful. If they get on a task, you know it's going
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.940]   to be get done. It's going to be, it's going to be done excellently and they're going to
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:18.260]   keep doing it until they aren't doing it anymore. And then there's a lot of people who are well-intending.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.340]   They're the first ones to volunteer, but they're also the first ones to flake, you know? And
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:28.740]   it's frustrating because certain things don't get done the way we want it to get done. But
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.500]   whenever you work with volunteers, that comes with the territory. So we can make it look
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.180]   very professional by hiring full-time staff and pay them to get it done. And we can come
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:45.220]   to church and enjoy the fruit of the labors of people who've been paid to do it. Or we
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.580]   can do it the biblical way. Okay, now you know what I'm talking about. Okay? We come
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:56.260]   to church and God has called each one of us to serve, to serve voluntarily as an act of
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:02.220]   worship. And so because there's different levels of maturity, different levels of discipline,
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.140]   some things get done excellently, some things are done poorly. But the purpose of the reason
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:14.020]   why we do that is because God has called the church to build the church. Just because we
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:21.300]   have finances, it's not a good idea just so that we can make it look better. See, our
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:27.180]   church is filled with people who are volunteering as an act of worship. And so the calling is
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.460]   let us consider, think carefully how our lives and our behavior and our speech can provoke
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.460]   other people toward love and good deeds. So when you're surrounded by people who are serving,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.700]   like it's naturally, naturally it provokes other people to serve. And that's what we
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:48.540]   desire in the church, right? Not to make you feel guilty about serving, but to provoke
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.780]   you to serve, to want to serve. So when new people come to church and they see a church
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:58.780]   filled with people volunteering, coming to church early to set up, to clean afterwards,
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.180]   and they might be thinking, "Oh, how come the other church that I was at, they hired
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.900]   all these people to get this done and it's done so well." And then they might sit here
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:14.140]   and just kind of like enjoy, you know, everything's running so well, but just enjoy the church.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:20.740]   So we are called to live in such a way that others are to be provoked. Every morning,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.140]   if you show up here early, as early as 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, probably 6.30 or
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.660]   earlier than that, there's a group of people here who comes every Sunday who sets up the
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:35.540]   AV. Our prayer team comes earlier than everybody else every single week and they practice for
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:41.700]   hours, right? And then there's people who come, set up the chairs, they sanitize, you
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.580]   know, these tents would look much better if we hired people to do it, right? But we had
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.820]   professional pastors who did it, so it doesn't look as nice, right? But we have people in
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.900]   the church and part of the reasoning behind that is because we want to provoke people.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.180]   You know, I was thinking about this this week and the biggest and the latest example that
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.860]   I could think about is our brother and sister, Rachel and Andy Wong, you know, when they
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.620]   volunteered as soon as we went online, you know, they started contemplating and thinking
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.780]   like how can they provoke a church, how can they encourage a church? And remember, they
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.420]   came up with the idea of service fair and they asked if it was okay. So this was not
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.260]   started by the church leaders, it was not our idea, they had an idea, like we're online,
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.940]   let's make the most of it and they asked if they can do it. Of course you can do it, you
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.340]   know, we're not going to stop you, you're going to make money for the church and for
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.700]   the causes. Not thinking anything's going to come out of this, you know, especially
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.420]   me. I don't know about other pastors and leaders, I was very skeptical. I was encouraged by
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:45.020]   what they wanted to do, but I was very skeptical. Like people are afraid to come out of their
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.040]   house, who's going to volunteer to serve and who's going to ask, you know, these disease
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.620]   infected people to come to their house? That's what I was thinking, right? At least at the
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.140]   beginning, right? Well, I mean, obviously you guys know what happened, it started and
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:04.700]   then you had all these people in the church volunteering, you know, gourmet meals, piano
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:12.100]   lessons to take pictures, boat rides, dental services, eye care, you know, free sunglasses
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:20.140]   and all these things and then, you know, off-road camping and raised over $10,000, you know,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:26.540]   in the church. And all the while just volunteering, you know, not initiated by the church or church
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:32.060]   leaders and the church got involved and we raised more money than we've done in any other
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:37.460]   activity. We can have like three seasons of softball tournaments and not raise that money,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:44.020]   right? And I was thinking, "Wow, that was easy. We should just let them run it." And
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:49.220]   it was just, again, it's because a couple just thought that, "How can we, how can we
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.700]   provoke the church?" And our whole church was affected by it, right? And even now when
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:00.020]   I think about it, man, that was, that was not, it wasn't just a good idea, but the fact
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:05.660]   that, you know, the couple decided like, "Oh, they want to make the most of the situation
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.460]   that we're in," while everybody else may be thinking, "What are we going to do?" And maybe
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.860]   we were thinking that. And as a result, the whole church was provoked. We raised money
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:21.100]   for good causes, you know, people were volunteering, they're paying for four $500 meals, crazy,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:26.420]   right? Going off-road and spending three days with people you don't know, you know, and
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:35.340]   then building relationships. We were all provoked. You know, see, you can't do that from a distance.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:40.620]   You can't do that simply online. The church gathers together. Even when we were offline,
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.140]   they were working toward, "How do we do this? How do we provoke each other on toward loving
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.580]   good deeds?" And that's what he was saying, that we ought to contemplate and think and
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:57.900]   to consider and to apply, "How can we build a church where just being a part of the church
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:06.260]   provokes other people to love and to commit their lives to good works?" He says to do
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:12.140]   this, "Not forsaking our own assembling together." The reason why he's saying that is because
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:17.360]   that's what was happening in the early church. It's not just coming out of nowhere. Part
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.020]   of the reason, part of the ramification of people drifting was that they were beginning
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.260]   to neglect their assembly because that's usually what happens when people are not doing well
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.780]   spiritually. One of the first things that you see is that they don't gather. They feel
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.340]   guilty, they feel shame, or they're disgruntled, and one of the first thing that is is they
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:42.340]   don't see the importance of the gathering. So some people were just beginning to drift.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:48.360]   And again, that's the reason why this is written, is to get them back to church, to get them
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:55.240]   to gather together. But the other reason why is because the persecution was intense. Maybe
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:01.440]   for the first time, there were physical consequences for their gathering. And that's the reason
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.120]   why he keeps saying, "All the more as you see the day drawing near." He didn't say,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.360]   "Oh, let's gather together as long as it's safe. Let's not drift as long as everything
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.640]   is good." He said, "All the more, all the more as it becomes dangerous, all the more
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.960]   as the world becomes more hostile to the Christian faith." He says, "All the more not forsaking
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:30.200]   our own assembling together." The church, 1 Timothy 3.15 says, "It is the household
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:38.400]   of God." It was never meant to be done from a distance, through letters, through online.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:44.240]   Now obviously there are periods of life where we have gone through, where we may temporarily
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.120]   not be able to gather together. Maybe there's some young parents who have children, or sometimes
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.600]   you're sick, or you may be out of town. But he says, "Not forsaking our own assembling
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.840]   together as it is the habit of some." Meaning, they don't see the high value of the gathering
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.480]   of the church. So every time it becomes inconvenient, every time there's a little bit of danger,
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.280]   every time there's even a little bit of cost, first thing that they forsake is the assembling
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:20.520]   together. Let's make this very clear. When the church first shut down, secular government
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:27.960]   said, "We're going to keep what is essential open, and non-essentials shut down." We, from
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.640]   the very get-go, we were very cautious about abiding by that, because a secular world cannot
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.200]   tell the church what is essential. Of course it's not essential to them. They don't believe
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.360]   in God. They reject the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They don't have the hope
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:51.880]   of eternity in Jesus. So for them, living and eating and surviving is, and whatever
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.560]   causes that, is essential. Everything else is not essential, because they think of religion
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.280]   as a security blanket. And you don't need that. You can have the security blanket at
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.520]   home. You can hear comforting words on the internet. You don't have to be gathered together.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:15.160]   That's a perspective coming from a non-Christian world. My concern is, again I'm not saying
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.800]   that all churches have done this for this reason. My concern is, Christians have too
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:26.920]   easily accepted the standards of what is essential and non-essential from the secular world.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.320]   Let me make this very clear. The church is essential, because the very nature of the
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:38.520]   word "Ekklesia" means the physical gathering of people who are called out. So when a Jew
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.440]   in the early church heard even the very term "church," they understood that as a physical
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:51.000]   gathering, because that's the meaning of the word. Assembly of people who are called out.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.760]   It's an assembly, not simply a meeting. But the physical assembly, "Ekklesia." Church was
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.200]   never meant to be done in a distance. In fact, the church is so important in 1 Corinthians 3,
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   16 and 17. Apostle Paul says, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God?" You know the "you"
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.880]   here is in plural, not singular. There's another part in Corinthians where he uses the singular,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:22.840]   but here in 1 Corinthians 3, it is "you" is in plural, meaning the assembly. "Ekklesia" are the
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.560]   temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you. If any man destroys the temple of God,
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.880]   God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy and that is what you are.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:38.920]   It is the church that Jesus came to die for. It is the church that God called us to serve.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:46.520]   We cannot practice Christian life outside of the assembly of the local church. Jesus says,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.240]   "I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:27:01.080]   Where do you practice lordship? In the church. Where do you practice the ordinances that God
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.160]   deems so important that some people not participating in an honorable way were
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.080]   actually falling asleep, meaning that they were disciplined directly from the Holy Spirit. Some
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   were actually falling sick and dying because they weren't practicing the ordinances in a way that
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:23.160]   honors God. Where do you practice ordinances outside of the physical assembly of the church?
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.920]   How do you practice your spiritual gifts? You don't practice that in your living room.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.080]   You don't know if you're a good singer or not by yourself singing in the closet.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.400]   You don't know what your spiritual gifts is, whether it's in teaching or serving or
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.440]   administration. You don't know any of that. You find that out in the assembly of the church.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:48.120]   You cannot practice obedience to the scriptures outside of the physical assembly of the church.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.040]   How do you provoke one another on toward love and good deeds from a distance?
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.320]   How do you keep each other accountable when you don't know how they're doing?
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.560]   You don't know they're suffering. How do you rejoice with them when you don't know
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.040]   what they're rejoicing over? How do you weep with them when you don't know what they're suffering?
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:09.960]   How do you have union with Christ if the church, the physical assembly of the church,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:15.480]   is the body of Christ and He is the head of the church? When we are physically separated,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.800]   how do we proclaim to have union with Christ if we are away? See, the church was never meant to be
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:28.840]   practiced from a distance. If our understanding of a church is just simply attending and listening
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:35.800]   to online sermons, then yes, you can practice that. But the biblical understanding of church
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:42.120]   that is described briefly here, again this is not comprehensive, cannot be practiced outside
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.840]   of the physical assembly. And that's why he says, not forsaking. Consider how to stimulate,
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.400]   provoke one another, untoward love, loving good deeds, not forsaking the assembly as it is the
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.240]   habit of some, but encouraging one another all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:06.120]   To encourage, to call, to exhort, to beseech with strong force. There is a priority of urgency for
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:15.720]   the church to gather, especially now because he says all the more, all the more, because the church
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:23.560]   is meant to be a light, right? He says what good is light, right? If it loses the light, what good
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.440]   is the salt if it loses its flavor? All then to be thrown to the ground and to be trampled.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:35.080]   If God calls us to be a light, when is the light the most needed? Not in the middle of the day,
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.800]   right? You don't turn on the campfire in the middle of the day. You don't turn on lights in
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   the middle of the day. You turn on the light at night. The darker the world becomes, the more
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:53.480]   it necessitates the church to be brighter. And that's why he says all the more, all the more
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.680]   why the church needs to gather, all the more why the assembly of the church is essential.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:06.440]   Because our very nature requires us to be a greater light, to come together, to provoke
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.520]   one another, to draw near to God, to persevere in our faith, so that this world who is lost,
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.480]   thinking that if they can just change the president, if they can change the politics,
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   if they can change the economy, if they can get rid and get some vaccine, that everything will be
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:30.760]   good. And you and I know that that's not the case. They can fix all the problems in the world
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:38.280]   and at the end all have still sinned and fall short of the glory of God. While the world is
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:44.680]   searching in darkness, looking for answers, the church needs to be the light. That's why he says
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:52.200]   all the more. As it is getting dark, the church needs to gather. First Thessalonians 5, 2-7,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.080]   "For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.400]   While they are saying, 'Peace and safety,' then destruction will come upon them, suddenly like
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:08.040]   labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape." He says that the characteristics
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:13.160]   of people who are going to be caught off guard by the second coming of Christ
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.280]   are people who are primary goal in life is to seek peace and safety.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:24.040]   Peace and safety. Everything that we do is so that we can have some peace
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   and that we can have some safety. We put some money away in the bank so that we can have some safety.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:35.400]   We avoid certain things. We don't do certain things. We prioritize all of it based upon peace
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:42.120]   and safety. He says while people are pursuing and saying peace and safety, destruction will come
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.160]   and they will be caught off guard like a thief. A thief is something that is unwanted that's
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.760]   breaking into your house. So in other words, people are not going to want Jesus to come.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.920]   When we're living a life that is self-centered and all we are doing is pursuing our own happiness,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:06.840]   we don't want Jesus to come. Because He's breaking into my pursuit. If He comes tomorrow and
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:13.640]   everything that we're pursuing today, we have to scratch. That already tells us that we're pursuing
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:21.240]   the wrong things. We're going the wrong direction. He says, but in verse 4, "You brethren are not in
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:26.360]   darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief, for you are all sons of light and sons of
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:33.320]   day. We are not of the night nor of darkness, so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.080]   alert and let us be sober. For those who sleep do their sleeping at night and those who get drunk
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:45.880]   get drunk at night." He says, in other words, let us wake up all the more as we see the day drawing near.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:51.960]   As the world is running toward one direction, we run toward the other, because we want to be a
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:59.400]   greater light. I don't know about you, but because of what's going on, the opportunity to share the
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   share the gospel with the non-christian has multiplied. Because everybody is thinking,
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.440]   they may not be searching for God, but they're searching. You know, yesterday they had the gospel
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:16.600]   night and I know we had it online, so it was easier for people to come. But I also think that a lot of
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:22.040]   people showed up because of what's going on. They're looking for answers. What's going on?
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:27.400]   Even though they may not know that they're searching for Christ, they're searching for
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.280]   something, because they realize that the world that they trusted is falling apart.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:39.480]   So, they're looking for something. So, if the church is asleep and we're just like the rest of
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:44.600]   the world, concerned about peace and safety, then we're going to lose the opportunity to be a light
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.720]   in this world. When people are asking, where, why is this happening? Why is this happening? What is
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   going on? That we would be sober and alert to be able to point to scriptures and say, Jesus said
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:00.680]   this is going to happen. Jesus said, he predicted and point to the passages and be able to share
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.640]   with them that this is what Jesus said is going to happen. And to be able to share the gospel.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.840]   We are not like those in the dark who are asleep and just living day to day like the rest of the
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:21.560]   world. Living for the weekend, go to church, work, live for the weekend. The next thing you know,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.400]   a year, a decade, and a life passes by and that's all we've done.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:33.240]   Right now, the church has been shut down, at least generally. A lot of the churches have
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.800]   been shut down since March. And I've already shared this with you. They said that half of
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.440]   the millennials, that's millennials or whoever's 40 and younger, at least that's how they categorize
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.920]   it. Half of the people who are regularly attending church have already dropped out.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.680]   And those are the people who have just physically, completely dropped out. That's not
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.640]   considering the people who are drifting away from Christ, just on and off, maybe online.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:03.080]   It has had a huge effect in the church. Now, we can say God is sovereign and he's using that to
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:08.040]   prune the church and maybe at the end of it, the true, true Christians are going to remain. Maybe
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:14.760]   we could say that. And in God's sovereign plan, he is completely in control. But God has called
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:21.160]   the church to be responsible for the souls that he has given us in this generation. He told us to go
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.720]   make disciples, right? To baptize them, name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.400]   them to observe all that I have commanded you. And he commanded the church to do this.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:38.920]   So to see half of the young people who have already gone. And in the last two decades,
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:45.240]   the greatest concern that every church planter, every church leader had was that we were losing
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.680]   this young generation. You know, our church was kind of an anomaly because we have a large
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.480]   gathering of young people. You know, when I talk to my pastor friends in Orange County,
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:02.840]   in the Southern Baptist, 95% of the churches are slowly decaying and dying. Average age is 75 and
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:10.360]   older. And so the young generation is, is being lost. We work so hard and we're not, I'm not just
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.600]   talking about us. Our, my, our generation of pastors have worked so hard to reach the young
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:21.640]   generation and just in an instant, half of them are gone. And for the church to sit back and say,
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:32.840]   everything is good. It is a tragedy that you and I need to stay sober. All the more,
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.440]   all the more as the churches are struggling, all the more as the world is lost, all the more
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.800]   as the politicians are fighting each other, the church needs to be the light. This is why we need
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.320]   to gather, that we need to consider carefully how we may live our lives to provoke each other
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.520]   on toward loving good deeds, not forsaking our assembling together as it is the habit of some.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.480]   So I want to conclude with, with this, with homework.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:09.000]   And so the homework is to first consider carefully, right? You know, typically we have a
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.960]   circle of friends that we're comfortable with and, and whoever's not in that circle of friends,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:19.800]   we, we're oblivious and we're okay with that for the most part, right? Because I practice love with
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.520]   those people. I practice accountability with those people. And you know what I noticed was when our
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:30.760]   church started to grow beyond 200, I saw an attitude change in the church that was very
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.120]   disturbing to me, where people were beginning to ask me like, at what point are we going to stop
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.400]   growing? Meaning like, maybe if we just kept on sending people out, the church will stop growing.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.320]   And part of the reason was there was a concern that the church wasn't like the way it was before,
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.480]   you know, come over to my house and have dinner, we can have fellowship, we all knew each other,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.920]   and everybody knew what was going on, but it became harder after about 200.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:01.080]   And I know I, again not everybody, but I know why some people were asking that, because fellowship
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:07.240]   became more difficult. And so they just wanted a small group of friends and 200 was, it was
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:13.960]   maximum. Ideally it would be 100, right? But 200 is maximum, but beyond that it almost felt like
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:19.240]   people were starting to say, you know, I have enough people in my life, and so all the new
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   people you guys deal with, and then we're just going to insulate ourselves, and then, you know,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:30.760]   our circle of influence and friends just stop with that group. So when people ask me like, hey,
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:36.360]   Pastor Peter, how big do you want our church to be? I say, I used to say six billion,
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:43.640]   right? And then now I say seven billion, because God called us to the world, right?
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:52.280]   God called us to make disciples of all the nations, so there is no number. So if God sends a
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.400]   thousand people, we are responsible for those thousand people. God sends a hundred thousand
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.840]   people, we're responsible to do our best for the hundred thousand people, because we are called to
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.640]   be the light. Now again, obviously our relationship isn't going to be the same with a hundred thousand
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:14.840]   people, obviously, but if we start to have this mentality that I have enough friends, and outside
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.800]   of that little bubble that I have, that I don't really care about anybody else, that is not a
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.440]   biblical attitude, right? God called the church to gather together, to consider carefully, and so
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:32.920]   outside of your bubble, the homework is, are there people in your life that maybe you haven't talked
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.000]   to in a while, you don't know where they are spiritually? Maybe there's some people that you
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.160]   don't know at all, and you see them every single Sunday, you've been at the church five, six,
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:46.520]   seven years, and you've never even said hello to them, because you're like, they're not part of
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:56.040]   your little circle. So my challenge to you this morning, to consider, to think carefully, to
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:01.160]   consider how you're going to provoke, so find out what's going on in other people's life, give them
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:07.000]   a call, text them, you know, whether they respond or not, to find out what are the needs, who, who
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.280]   should you be rejoicing with, who should you be weeping with, to find out who needs encouragement,
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:20.040]   who is drifting, who's doing well, consider who, and then think carefully about what,
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:27.480]   how can I provoke them, right? Now, whenever we make application, and you make it too broad,
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:32.360]   you usually end up not doing it, right? You hear a sermon about prayer, saying, I'm going to be a
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   prayer warrior, right? And then you wake up next morning, you're tired, you have to go to work,
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.240]   and then you come back, you're tired, then you go through the same routine,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.600]   always the back of your mind, I'm going to be a prayer warrior, but tomorrow,
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.760]   right? And then it just kind of passes by, say, I'm going to be a better Christian.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:54.440]   Well, what does that mean? So whenever we make application, and you make this broad
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.200]   stroke of application, it never gets done. So my challenge to you is to consider carefully,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.520]   find out what's going on, maybe make a list of people that maybe you need, even just to find
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.160]   out what's going on, and then to make an application, how are you going to provoke them,
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:16.280]   right? Maybe what you what you may consider doing may not be as like, largely impactful as what was
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.480]   what we did, you know, with the service fair. But even small things, you know, I get provoked every
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:27.080]   single week, when I drive up here, you know, I usually get to church about 730, or 715. And
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.200]   it's already set up, the AV team is going, there's people here practicing, you know, and there's guys
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.720]   doing parking, you know, and setting up chairs and doing all this, every Sunday, I come to church,
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.880]   and I get provoked. You know, I get provoked, because there's people serving, you don't have
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.800]   to do grand things, you don't have to be up in the front, doing grand things to provoke people,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   you know, just your simple act of service, of being unselfish and serving other people,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:57.560]   considering others better than yourself, right? What can you do individually to encourage those
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.320]   people? And what can you do collectively, or individually as a church? Now, I already said,
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.280]   we need people to volunteer for chair set up, for the, you know, for the scanners, and to various
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.320]   things, and, you know, I get so encouraged when I see young families strapped with their babies,
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.640]   you know, out in the hot sun, serving, and, you know, doing parking, because I know how much work
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.320]   that is, just even, just even have the kid near you, right? Just so encouraging to see, you know,
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:30.680]   how can I provoke somebody on toward love and good deeds? So that's our homework. So next week,
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.000]   when you come, I'm going to check to see if you're, if you've done your homework, okay? So today,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.800]   sit down, and to contemplate, to think, make a list, and then to apply these things.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:45.640]   Imagine what the church will be like when the church is filled with people coming to provoke
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:51.800]   one another toward love and good deeds. Instead of a church filled with people asking themselves,
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:59.400]   what about me? Imagine how miserable of a place a church would be, when every person that comes
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.880]   to church is irritated with the person sitting next to them, because they didn't get enough
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:11.960]   attention. What a miserable church that would be. But again, on the other hand, what a powerful
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.400]   witness we would be, if the church gathered together, unlike the rest of the world,
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:24.360]   because of what Christ has done, because of of the motivation and the work that Christ is doing in us,
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.200]   that every person that comes to church is contemplating and thinking, how can I be of
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.880]   service? Imagine the impact that we would have in this world, like the kind of light that God
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:43.320]   called us to be. So again, as an application, I hope, again, and it doesn't have to be big,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:49.800]   it doesn't have to be grand, and no one needs to know about it, but again, my encouragement is to
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:56.520]   make that challenge to yourself, and do something small or big, that we may build up this church.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.280]   You don't have to be here, you don't need a title, you don't need to join some service team,
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:08.680]   even just something small. How can I, in the unique way that God has gifted you, build up the church?
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:16.360]   All the more, right now, right? All the more. If there is any time that I can remember that I've
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:22.280]   been a Christian, where the world needs to hear the clear presentation of the gospel, it is today.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.240]   Because they are lost, right? Instead of falling into despair,
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.960]   let's look to Christ, the author and the perfecter of our faith. Okay, let's pray.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   Gracious and loving Father, we pray that your word, that you've implanted in our hearts and
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.040]   in our minds, will not return until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained it,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.920]   help us truly to be a church that draw nears to you, that hold fast the confession that we have
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:45:00.040]   made, and that we may carefully consider how to provoke one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   That we would not forsake the assembly of our brothers and sisters, Lord God, in the church,
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:13.320]   as it may have become a habit of some, but all the more as we see the day drawing near,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.920]   as the world becomes darker, I pray, Lord God, that you would help us as a church to become
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:25.320]   brighter. May Christ, in his name, in his gospel, in his glory, be magnified through this.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
