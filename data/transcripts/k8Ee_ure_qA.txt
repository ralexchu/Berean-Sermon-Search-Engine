[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   Lord, we recognize that our worship given unto you
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   is something, Lord, you have commanded.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   And so we give and lift up to you.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.760]   But also, Lord, our worship to you
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   is something that God continues to feed our soul
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   because it is done in faith.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.760]   And I pray, Lord, that our faith would
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   continue to grow in both knowledge and truth,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   and Lord God in the spirit.

[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   Lord, we pray, God, that in our time of communing with you,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   God, lifting up our requests, supplications, Lord,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   God, in all these things, Lord, we would experience your mercy,

[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   Lord, you hear our prayers.

[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.060]   I want to encourage you with just a word that
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:32.140]   many of the scriptures when it's expressing prayer and supplication it
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:38.300]   begins with first acknowledging God. Amen. We recognize God for who He is and we
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.340]   sing and we pray in response to that character.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.500]   I want to read to you a Bible passage from Psalm chapter 66
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.020]   and it reads like this. Shout joyfully to God
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.540]   all the earth. Sing the glory of His name.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:59.020]   Make His praise glorious. Say to God how awesome are your works because of the
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.740]   greatness of your power. Your enemies will give faint obedience to you but all
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.940]   the earth will worship you and will sing praises to you. They will
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.340]   sing praises to your name. So as we begin if you
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.620]   would take time now thinking about God's greatness. Say a lot
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.140]   of prayers that begins not with please give me but begins with
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.660]   you are this. Thank you and praise you. I bless you because you're mighty.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.860]   You've been powerful. You've been faithful and more.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.380]   So let's take time to meditate and think about God's greatness, His glory and
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.540]   majesty and we're going to give you some time to
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.580]   do that now. Let's pray.

[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:20.900]   [Music]
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   Please join me as I lift up a prayer for that.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:36.900]   Heavenly Father, we know Lord, that God, you say in your scripture, you are searching for those who would worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.900]   That is what you are looking for. That's what you're pleased by.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.900]   And so I pray, Father God, many of us, we try to do private quiet time and devotion.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.900]   Help us to worship in that environment.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:55.900]   Help us, Father God, never to bow our heads before you and then come out of it thinking, "I got nothing out of that."
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:01.900]   But rather, help us to give to you our hearts, render to you all of our affection and more.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.900]   And I pray that, God, you would grant to us consistency.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.900]   You know, many of us try to do, Lord, times with our families to give service to you.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.900]   And, Lord, sometimes we get busy, sometimes it becomes inconsistent.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.900]   But if there's disappointment about anything, help us, Father God, to be disappointed at that.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.900]   Rather than our homes not being cleaned or whatever it may be.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   And likewise for our church, I pray, Father God, if they're worried about not doing anything well, it would be about worship.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.900]   God, that our hearts would be joined together to lift you up.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.900]   And that the content of our mind would be such wonder of who you are.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   That our heart would be filled with such awe, Lord God, at the greatness of the God that we worship.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:52.900]   And so I pray, Lord, just the entire tenor, the entire environment of our worship services on Sunday.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   I pray, Father God, that we would not be forgetful or dry.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   But rather, Lord, I pray that we'd be filled with passion for you.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   We thank you, Lord. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   No mortal man would dare to stand before your throne.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:42.900]   Before the Holy One of Heaven.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   It's only by your blood and it's only through your mercy, Lord, I come.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:59.900]   I bring an offering of worship to my King.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:05.900]   No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:13.900]   Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:24.900]   And oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   The sun cannot compare to the glory of your love.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:37.900]   There is no shadow in your presence.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   No mortal man would dare to stand before your throne.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:50.900]   Before the Holy One of Heaven.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   It's only by your blood and it's only through your mercy, Lord, I come.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   I bring an offering of worship to my King.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:14.900]   No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:21.900]   Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:38.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:45.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:52.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   Oh Lord, I bring an offering to you.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:38.900]   Stand up in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   And wonder how he could love me.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:51.900]   A sinner condemned unclean.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:35.900]   He took my sins, He took my sins and my sorrows.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:41.900]   He made them His very own.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   He bore the burden to Calvary and suffered and died alone.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:07.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   When with the ransomed in glory His face I at last shall see.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:56.900]   It will be my joy through the ages to sing up in love for me.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:09.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:24.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:51.900]   How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.900]   Amen.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.900]   At this time, if we can continue to as we pray, there are times
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.900]   when we need to really think about the nature of our
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.900]   relationship with God.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.900]   I know as we have been praying we are probably already thinking
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.900]   about how we have been worshiping and responding.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   But I do think that in our day we have a hard time being
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.900]   genuinely expressive and saying the things that make us feel
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.900]   awkward.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.900]   Right.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.900]   What I mean by that is there are certain things like, I miss you.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.900]   There are things we just don't say sometimes.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   But some of us have struggled where we spent a week or two
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   weeks or three weeks sometimes feeling far from God.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   And at that time in that moment you are able to say, I miss you
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.900]   so much.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   Because feeling far from you is the pits.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   Right.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   So I want to ask that you pray in this way.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.900]   Psalm 18...
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   In terms of the way you pray, you can pray in silence.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.900]   If you would like to, you can stand up and raise your hands.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.900]   Because many saints before us that's how they prayed every
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.900]   time.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.900]   Standing in silence before the Lord and standing in reverence.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   What's more if you want to vocalize your prayer, I know
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.900]   there is people all around you but you can.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.900]   Why?
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.900]   Because this is a time to express your affection to God.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:47.900]   And we need you in our prayer time now.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   (Praying in silence)
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   (Praying in silence)
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:39.900]   (Praying in silence)

[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:39.900]   (Praying in silence)
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   (Praying in silence)
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:19.900]   (Praying in silence)

[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   (Praying in silence)
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:39.900]   (Praying in silence)

[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:59.900]   (Praying in silence)
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:15.900]   (Music)
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:21.900]   I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:27.900]   Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to you
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.900]   In surrender I must give my every part
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:41.900]   Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:47.900]   Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring?
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:53.900]   To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:59.900]   Savior, what can be said? What can be sung?
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   As the praise of your name for the things you have done
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:15.900]   Oh, my words could not tell, not even impart
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:23.900]   Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:30.900]   (Music)
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:36.900]   You deserve my every breath for you've paid the great cost
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:43.900]   Giving up your life to death, even death on a cross
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:50.900]   You took all my shame away, there defeating my sins
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:57.900]   Open up the gates of hell and have mercy on me
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:03.900]   Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring?
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:17.900]   Savior, what can be said? What can be sung?
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:24.900]   As the praise of your name for the things you have done
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:32.900]   Oh, my words could not tell, not even impart
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:40.900]   Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.900]   Sing Jesus, what can I give?
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:51.900]   Jesus, what can I give? What can I bring?
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:05.900]   Savior, what can be said? What can be sung?
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:12.900]   As the praise of your name for the things you have done
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:20.900]   Oh, my words could not tell, not even impart
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:29.900]   Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:36.900]   (Guitar playing)
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.900]   Let's continue to sing about our surrender to God
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.900]   in everything and every aspect of our lives.
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:05:04.900]   (Guitar playing)
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:10.900]   I'm giving you my heart and all that is within
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   I lay it all down for the sake of you, my King
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   I'm giving you my dreams, laying down my rights
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:31.900]   I'm giving up my pride for the promise of your love
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:44.900]   And I surrender all to you, all to you
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:59.900]   And I surrender all to you, all to you
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:06.900]   I'm giving you this song, waiting at the cross
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:12.900]   And all the world holds dear, I count it all as love
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:19.900]   For the sake of knowing you, the glory of your name
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:27.900]   To know the lasting joy in sharing in your pain
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:40.900]   And I surrender all to you, all to you
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:52.900]   And I surrender all to you, all to you
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.900]   One last time
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:07.900]   And I surrender all to you, all to you
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:20.900]   And I surrender all to you, all to you
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.900]   (Guitar playing)
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:30.900]   Heavenly Father, we do want to pray, God, that even the surrender of the things that we're attached to,
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.900]   we need spiritual strength.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:38.900]   And so we pray, Father God, that your spirit would use the sharpness of your word
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:43.900]   to convict us, to make sure, Father God, the ministry of your truth
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   is producing in us the sanctification that we need.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.900]   So Lord, we lift that up to you in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.900]   As a final thought for us to continue to pray for,
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:02.900]   is throughout the Sunday sermons, Pastor Peter has been preaching heavily about being of faith.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:10.900]   And it has radically, radically just made me think about ways in which I'm not thinking of the eternal.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   Ways in which I'm not thinking of the sound, thinking of the things that are heavenly,
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   but rather that my thoughts still are circulating around the things that could be shaken.
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.900]   And what I'm specifically talking about then, we have to pray and be about our agenda,
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.900]   should be the salvation of the lost.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.900]   It should be that we are dedicated to this cause.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:35.900]   We're going to adorn the gospel.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:41.900]   We're going to make the light shine on the path to salvation and to the eternal state.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.900]   And so let's pray and lift up that God would use our church,
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.900]   all the faith that we exercise, not just simply to have a nice community,
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:54.900]   which is a byproduct and fruit, but that we would be about preaching the message.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:09:00.900]   And let's pray that the specific people God has ordained to be in our lives,
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   even the people that you feel like are just kind of there,
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   churched around the place, that you lift them up by name.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.900]   Even the people that you think are hardened.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.900]   Even the people that you think you've already tried, lift them up.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.900]   And especially I know times like this when we come together corporately
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   should be the time we're lifting up our loved ones, our parents, brothers and sisters,
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.900]   people who don't know Christ yet.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.900]   So let's take time now to beseech the Lord, ask his spirit to work.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:37.900]   Let's pray.
