[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Hello everyone at Beroean Community Church and online viewers.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   My name is Joshua Chun. I've been a member at Beroean Community Church for two years.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   I first attended in 2014 during my extended breaks from school.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I've been regularly attending since 2017.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Yeah, this is my testimony.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   So before receiving Christ, I knew God only as a merciful God.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I pictured him as an old grandfather ready to see me whenever I please with forgiveness in his hand.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Although this is true that God, although it is true that God does have mercy and forgiveness for me,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   the single faceted view of God led me to abuse the love and grace that he has given me.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   The Bible says that God is King and Lord, but my actions never reflected that truth.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Born and raised in the church, I learned what the gospel was at a young age.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Soon after, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior and was sprinkled baptized in middle school.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Reflecting back on my baptism and life after baptism,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I didn't truly understand the Lord part of my confession.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I still kept forging my own path, doing as I pleased,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   and attached Jesus to my goals to keep them aligned with his will.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   My view of God was small and wrong.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   He is so much more than just the one I pray for to relieve my guilty conscience.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I always wanted a miraculous moment, a feeling of enlightenment,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   an "aha" moment where all of a sudden I know God and I knew his will, but that wasn't the case.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Like many of you, it was just a gradual growth in the faith.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   With the help of older brothers and the community around me, and of course the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   God has revealed so much more than just his mercy.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   The holiness of God, his sovereignty, and his lordship have changed my faith greatly.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   About three to four years ago, I understood and accepted the kingship part,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   and all the groundwork that had been laid in my life was solidified.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   As it says in Philippians 1.6, "For I am confident of this very thing,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus."
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I'm still not perfect, far from it, but I have faith that God will lead me the entire way.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   After receiving Christ, my view of God and also myself has been transformed.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   The chasm between God and man is no longer great, but impossible.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   A sinful man can only come before a thrice holy God by the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I have no means of my own to be washed clean of the filth we call sin.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Reading from Ephesians 1.13, "And you were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   the gospel of your salvation.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit."
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   It is such a big burden lifted off my shoulders, knowing that there is nothing that I could do to make it into heaven.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   That it is an impossible feat, not attainable by anyone here,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   but only by the grace of God through Jesus Christ.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   By that grace, I stand here today a reborn man.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Or at least I will be after I get into the law.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   God is King, and we are his bond slaves.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   But there is no place I'd rather be than in his courts.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   We serve a good King, the only King.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   To know him and do his bidding is the greatest gift of grace that we could receive.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   [Applause]
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Doctor, do you understand when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in his death?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And then when you're coming out, you are united with his resurrected life?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Yes, I do.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   [Applause]
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   If you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   [Pause]
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   We're going to be looking at verses 1 through 18, but I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's a little bit lengthy.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   I'm just going to read the first seven verses before we jump in.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 10, verse 1 through 7.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And again, I strongly encourage you, the text that we're going to be looking at each week is going to be posted up on Saturday.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   So you can kind of guess what text I'm going to be on even before I put it on.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   But if you just want to be sure, just highly encourage you to do that before you come on Sunday.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   It'll help you to be able to follow along the text.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Okay, starting from verse 1.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   [Reading verse 1]
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   [Reading verse 2]
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   [Reading verse 3]
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Let's pray.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   We thank you for the good things that you've given us, things that we are aware of,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   things that you are doing behind the scenes that we are not aware of.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Help us, Lord, to open our eyes to see your glory.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   May your word shine greater light to who you are.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   We thank you and we love you. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   You know, despite the pandemic and things being shut down,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   there's a lot of people who are getting married, especially at our church.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I think every year there's probably at least 10 to maybe even 17 weddings that are going on.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And I know there's actually quite a few couples right now preparing
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and trying to figure out how to get this done in the pandemic.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And I think all the pastors are engaged in some sort of marriage counseling
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   as this is going on and trying to figure out how to do all of these things.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   But I think one of the key things, at least for me, when I meet with the young couples,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   is about communication.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   I've learned throughout the years talking to various couples
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   that one of the major conflicts in marriage is usually communication.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And often people fight about how they're fighting rather than what they're fighting about.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   You know, like how they said something or how they reacted to how somebody said something.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And so much of it is because we have a difficult time communicating and understanding each other.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Some of you are like me. I tend to be more direct.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   If I have something to say, I'll just say it.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I'll say it and you don't need to read between the lines.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   There's nothing in between the lines.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   If I'm upset, I'll tell you I'm upset. If I'm sad, I'll tell you I'm sad.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I'm not going to leave it out there and hopefully you guess.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   But some of you don't communicate like that.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Some of you, yes means yes, it could mean maybe, maybe no.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And it's kind of thrown out there and communication is not as direct
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   because you tend to be more soft, compassionate, just a better person.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   But whatever the case is, the way we communicate is different.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And so we kind of have to figure out what they mean by this and how they mean by that.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   And I think there is a benefit in both ways to communicate.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   When we think about the Old Testament, the Bible says that God spoke in shadows.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   The tabernacle, it says in verse one, is a shadow and it's not the reality.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It's about the good things to come.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   If you think about what he was communicating,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   he was talking about his nature and the salvation of mankind.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Why didn't he make it clear?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Why didn't he just spell out, this is Jesus, this is atonement,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   this is pointing to the fact that your sins aren't going to be forgiven until he comes,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   he's going to come on this day, he's going to do this, this, and this.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   The shadow basically causes us to look at that and do some work to figure out what does this mean?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Because it wasn't the reality.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   So the question that we ask is why did he communicate that way?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I think in different cultures, just like I said, I'm the type of person that tends to be direct,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   and then there's other people who kind of beat around the bush because they don't want to hurt your feelings,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and they'll say certain things hoping that you'll get it.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   And it's like that in cultures too.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And I realize that the Western culture gravitates toward the New Testament because the New Testament is direct.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It'll tell you, I'm Apostle Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and I'm writing to you because these are my concerns, and these are five things that I want you to think about,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   and here's my conclusion, goodbye.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   And that's how the epistles are written.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   You come to the Old Testament, and you have some sacrifices, you have some incest,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   you have some idol worship, and then the end.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   You have some revivals, and then the end.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   And it's not crystal clear, and you kind of have to work to figure out what is the point here.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Years ago, I was at a pastors conference, Together for the Gospel, and there's probably over 3,000 pastors there,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and I remember one of the keynote speakers asked us,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   "How many of you pastors are preaching through the Old Testament?"
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And so out of 3,000, only about 10 of us stood up,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   and I just happened to be one of those people who were standing, and I was very filled with pride.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   That's right.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   But I was surprised that out of that many people, only a handful of us are preaching through the Old Testament.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   So obviously his encouragement was, "We need to get to the Old Testament."
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And the reason why we need to get to the Old Testament is because Old Testament prepares us for the New Testament.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   And just like anything else, because we live in a culture where we gravitate toward clear communication,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   we think that if it's not clear, we're just kind of like, "Okay, let the theologians and the seminary people,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   let them deal with it."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   And so most people on the Western side, where you and I live, are pretty vague about the Old Testament.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   We know the big stories about Noah, and we know about the flood, and we know about Abraham and Moses and the 10 plagues,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   but as soon as you go beyond that Sunday school lessons, very few people understand what's going on in the Old Testament.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   But there's a reason why two-thirds of the Bible are written in this format.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   It was to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   So what I want to look at today, this morning, in Hebrews chapter 10,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   when he says all these things were given as a shadow of the good things to come,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   why did he communicate this way?
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   What is the purpose of the shadow?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Why did he establish and put so much teaching of the tabernacle, and how does that affect us as Christians?
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Okay, so there's three things we want to look at in chapter 10.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Number one, God used a shadow to cause us to long for the reality.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   God used a shadow.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   We're talking about the tabernacle system and pretty much the old covenant.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He communicated through the shadow to cause us to long for the reality.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   In Hebrews chapter 10, verse 1, it says, "For the law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and not the very form of the things."
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   In other words, if you're sitting somewhere and you see a big shadow that's coming,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   the first thing you want to do is to do what?
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   To look at who is casting the shadow.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Who is casting the shadow?
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   So he said that the tabernacle was established as a shadow pointing to the reality that is to come.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   In fact, the word "gospel" in the New Testament is called a mystery.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   The Greek word for that is "mousterion."
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   And the word "mousterion" literally means this, and this is straight out of the Bible dictionary.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   "Mousterion" is that which is known to the "mouestes," the initiated.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Which probably means nothing to you.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   But basically what it means is, the gospel, the mystery means revelation to those who are seeking.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   That's basically what the gospel means. Mystery.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   It is information that is given to those who are seeking.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   And that's exactly what Jesus says when we look at the Beatitudes.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   And one of the Beatitudes is, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Those who are hungering and thirsting shall be satisfied.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Not those who are just religiously going through the motion, but those who are actively seeking.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   So the first thing that he says is, the purpose of the shadow is to cause in us a hungering for the reality.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   It's to cause us to come seek him out.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Let me give you an example of that, okay?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   You know, sometimes I've been to a wedding, I've been to weddings where the appetizer is so good.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   It makes you anticipate the main course.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   You're out there and, man, this shrimp is awesome.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And then the next thing comes out, it's like, oh my gosh, that was better than the other one.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   And then the next thing comes out, it's like, oh my gosh, this is so good.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   And as you eat the appetizer, you can't help but thinking, if the appetizer is this good,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   I wonder how good the main course is going to be.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Because that's the purpose of the appetizer.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   The appetizer is not meant to fill you up.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   It's to prepare you, get your taste buds ready, get your stomach juices flowing, and to anticipate.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Now, if you get full with the appetite, you don't have any room for that.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   But that was the purpose of the appetizer.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Now, obviously, that's just an illustration.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I've been to weddings where the appetizer was better than the main meal, right?
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   But the purpose of the appetizer is to prepare you and to long for what is coming.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   The shadow is kind of an appetizer to prepare us for the reality that was going to be found in Christ.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   That was the whole purpose of the shadow.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   That's why it says in Matthew 7, 7 through 8, "Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   For everyone who asks, receives. He who seeks, finds.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And to him who knocks, it will be opened."
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   You know, as a pastor, one of the things that I really enjoy engaging in is people asking questions.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Now, there's a difference between asking questions and questioning.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   There's a huge difference.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Sometimes people question because it's like, "I don't agree with you.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Why is that happening? Why is this?"
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   So they're not looking for answers. They're just challenging.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   But there are times when people will ask, genuinely ask questions because they want to know.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   "Oh, I'm curious. I heard this. I don't get this. I want to know."
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   And I enjoy engaging like that.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   People will say, "Oh, I don't want to bother you because you're so busy."
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   But that's why I became a pastor.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   So when people are genuinely seeking, right, it's great to be able to engage and participate in that type of interaction.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   You may ask, "Why does God even make us ask? Why does He just tell us?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Why does He make us seek? Why does He just show up?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Why does He ask us to knock? Why does He just keep the door open?"
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   See, the whole point of what He's doing is He provided everything that we need for our salvation.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   He gave His only begotten Son.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   But the only criteria, the only thing that He was asking of us is to seek Him.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   He wasn't just standing out and saying, "Well, if you show up to church, I'm just going to pass it out.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   If you show up to church and you're just raising a Christian home, I'm just going to pass it out."
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   He says, "No."
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   All He's asked us to do is make up our mind.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Are you going to follow Christ or are you just going to go through the motion?
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   So the whole purpose of the tabernacle is to instill in us a hungering and thirsting for righteousness
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   so that when we see the shadow, we would continue to ask the question, "What is the reality?"
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   If the shadow is this good, what must the reality be like?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   It's to build anticipation.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   You know, in 1 Corinthians 13, 9 it says, "For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with."
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Even now, the whole purpose of the Old Testament was to stir them up for the coming of Christ.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Now that Christ has come and He departed, part of the purpose of our gathering
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   is to stir us up for anticipation for His second coming.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   So in order for us to anticipate that our hope is not here, but ultimately over there.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   That's why He says in 1 Corinthians 13, 12, "For now we see in a mirror dimly,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   but then face to face, now I know in part, but then I will know fully,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   just as I also have been fully known."
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   You know, you and I are gathered together here, and I know it's hot, you know,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   and it may be uncomfortable, but you're not here because you miss my face, right?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Most of you.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   You're not here because I'm so riveting that you're hanging on every single word.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   I know myself, right?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Every once in a while I'll hear my own sermon, and I can't stand my own voice.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   And sometimes I wonder, "How do you do it?"
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   The only reason why you and I are gathered together is because we've tasted the goodness of God.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   I just happen to be a mouthpiece in which I'm pointing you to Christ.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   But I don't have--I'm not gifted enough, talented enough, or articulated enough
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   to gather your attention in this hot sun for even a week.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   If it was for me, you wouldn't be here.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   You and I are here because we've tasted the goodness of God, and we want more.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   But he says, "No matter what it is that you have experienced with God," he said,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   "it is like a child seeing through a mirror.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   It's dim, and all of this is to build anticipation.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   If Jesus that I met, even the little bit that I've tasted, is this good,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   what is it going to be like when we get to heaven?"
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   The shadow was given to us to point to the reality,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   to cause us to hunger for the reality in Christ.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   One of the questions that we commonly get is,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   "If you go to heaven, what will you say to Jesus?"
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   What kind of questions will you ask?
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   I remember--I think it was last week when we were having the family feud
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   that the Wongs put together, and one of the questions that was asked is,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   "What's a question that you would ask Jesus if you went to heaven?"
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   I think about that question a lot.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Not, "What am I going to ask?" Like, "How am I going to react?"
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   I remember when I was younger, when I first became a Christian,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   because I was young in my teenage years, I was thinking,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   "Oh, when I meet Jesus, I'm going to hold his hands, I'm going to hug him,"
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   even though I wasn't a baby at that time because I see him as a father figure.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Now that I'm in my 50s, that doesn't seem appropriate.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   How am I going to react when I see Jesus?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   I can't think of anything that I would say.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I have some questions.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   My first question is, "What happened to Andrew?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Why did he invite everybody and then not a part of the inner three?"
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   I want to know the human drama that happened with Andrew.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   I have a lot of questions.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Pastor Peter Chung said that his question is,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   "Did Adam and Eve have a belly button?"
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   You may all have different questions, but I think when we finally meet Christ,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   we're going to be speechless.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   That's what I think.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   I think we're going to be speechless.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   We're not going to have words.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   If the small glimpse that we've tasted of the goodness of God is only dimly,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   is only a shadow,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   what is the reality going to be when we're actually face-to-face with him?
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   See, that's what the shadow was for, is to build anticipation
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   so that we would long for his second coming,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   that we would not make this place our home,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   that no matter how tempting and no matter how great it may seem temporarily,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   that all of this becomes rubbish.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   And that was the purpose of the shadow.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   The second purpose of the shadow is to cause us to long for true forgiveness.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   True forgiveness.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Hebrews 10, 1-4, "By the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   make perfect those who draw near.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   because the worshippers, having once been cleansed,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   would no longer have the consciousness of sins."
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   In other words, their repeated need for sacrifices pointed to the fact
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   that their sin was constantly with them.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   If the sacrifices that they made took away their sins,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   they wouldn't have to do it anymore.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   You see, the fact that they needed to do it over and over again
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   was to teach him that they needed true forgiveness.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   Verse 3, "But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins, year by year,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   The purpose of these sacrifices was not to take away sins,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   but to remind them of their sins.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Did you catch that?
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   You see the difference between the two?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   When you make the sacrifices, you think, "Well, now I'm holy, now I'm clean,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   now I have a direct access to God."
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   But the author here is saying the purpose of these sacrifices,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   and why it was done repeatedly over and over again,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   is to remind them that no matter how much sacrifices you made,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   your sin still remains.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   You have to do it again and again and again.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   Even the drama of the Day of Atonement,
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   of all the sacrifices that they made,
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   they would put their hands symbolizing the sins of Israel going out to the wilderness
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and the scapegoat being sacrificed for their sins.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   They would go through all of that drama,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   and then next year they'd have to do it again.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   And he says all of that to remind them
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   that those sacrifices had no power to actually forgive them.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   It's to remind them that the sins will still remain.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   You know, I think the best way to understand the shadow, the tabernacle,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   is kind of like the way we take Tylenol.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   I've met some people who refuse to take Tylenol.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   And the reasoning that they give is, "Well, Tylenol doesn't fix the problem.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   It only hides the symptom."
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   And you get a bad headache, and you say,
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   "You know, I'm not going to take Tylenol because it harms my body,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   and it's not going to fix the problem."
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Maybe you got a headache because of dehydration.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   And so you take the pill to get rid of the headache,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   but it has nothing to do with dehydration.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   So Tylenol can be harmful if you never deal with the problem.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   If you don't drink water, if you take Tylenol
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   and you don't drink enough water to get rid of the reason behind the headache,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   then the Tylenol becomes a problem.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   So some people--and I've met some doctors who don't believe in taking Tylenol, right?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   But we take Tylenol so that we can function.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   We can function. It doesn't deal with the problem.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   We have to drink the water. We have to deal with the problem.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   But having the headache go away helps me to read,
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   helps me to study, helps me to function, without really curing the problem.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   See, that was the tabernacle.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   The tabernacle basically dealt with the sins
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   in order to be able to have a covenant relationship with this God
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   without ever taking away the root problem.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   And that's what he was telling them.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   It took away the immediate symptom to be able to function with God,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   but it constantly told them, "But the problem still remains
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   because sacrifice has to be done again.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   When Tylenol wears off, you have to do it again.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   You have to take it again because you're still dehydrated."
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   See, he says that's the reason why he has this.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   So anybody who relies on their good deeds and religiousness,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   all they're doing is masking their sins with good works.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   And it eases their conscience for a minute.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   But eventually the real problem is going to surface over and over and over again.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   But you know what's interesting?
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Hebrews 10.17. Hebrews 10.3 says,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   "All these sacrifices were the reminders of sins year by year
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   to cause them to remember, 'You are in your sins.'"
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   But then we get to verse 17 and he says,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   "And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more."
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Did you get that?
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   The whole reason why he caused us to remember our sins
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   is so that we may anticipate the only one
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   who can actually deal with our sins.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   And he says he will remember no more.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   He's causing us to remember our sins
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   so that we may run to the only one
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   who can actually deal with the actual problem of sins.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   And when we give it to him, he says he will remember it no more.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   Isn't that incredible?
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   He said that's why he communicated to us through the tabernacle
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   so that we may be able to understand it.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   In Psalm 103.12, "As far as the east is from the west,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   so far has he removed our transmissions from us."
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   And then in Isaiah 43.25,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   "I, even I, am the one who wipes out the transgressions of my own sake,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   and I will not remember your sins."
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I will not remember.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   I wanted you to remember so that you will recognize
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   that I will not remember when I come.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   You know, Satan has a lot of different names.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   But one of his key names that identifies how he works in our lives
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   is an accuser.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   He's an accuser. The one who accuses.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   He's the prosecutor.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   So if you have anything that he can cause you to feel guilty
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   and stray away from God, he said that's his duty.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   In Jeremiah 50.20, this is what God says about the sins of Israel.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   And I want you to remember,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   if you've ever read through the Old Testament,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   it's basically history of Israel's sin.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   How the curse of the law was being added upon them
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   generation after generation after generation.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   So by the time we end the Old Testament,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Israel is in utter despair.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Almost every single king in Israel led Israel to sin.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   But here was what it says, Jeremiah 50.20 in the New Covenant.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   It says, "In those days and at that time, declares the Lord,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   search will be made for the iniquity of Israel,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   but there will be none."
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Did you catch that?
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   He said, they're going to try to accuse Israel for their sins.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   They're going to search for their sins, but there will be none.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   And for the sins of Judah, but they will not be able to be found.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   For I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   He said, they're going to search for it.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   They're going to look to accuse Israel, but not because they are righteous.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   Not because they got their act together,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   and they're not going to sin anymore.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   It says, because I will pardon them.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   And because I will pardon them,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   they will look for reasons to accuse them.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   They will search, actively search, to find reasons to disqualify them.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   But they will not find it, he says, because I will pardon them.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   That was the whole purpose of the shadow.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   It's to remind us of our sins, so that we would run to the one who will not remember.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Third and finally, God used the shadow to cause us to long for true worship.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   For true worship.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   The text that we're looking at in verse 5 through 9 is almost verbatim,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   a copy of Psalm chapter 40, verse 6 through 8.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Where David is crying out to God, and this is what he says.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   He says, "Sacrifice an offering you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me."
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   Let's just stop right there.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   Sacrifice an offering you have not desired, meaning God did not desire it.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   Who commanded these sacrifices?
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   Who commanded these sacrifices?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   They're not talking about idols.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   He didn't say, "Worship of idols I did not desire."
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   He didn't say that.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   We spent almost a year and a half studying the book of Leviticus about what God desired of these sacrifices.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   And yet here in Psalm, David says, "Sacrifice an offering you have not desired."
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   Which is it?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   Why did you go through all of that drama, tell them to sacrifice, and then when they gave sacrifices, God said, "I don't want it."
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   And then verse 6, "In whole burnt offerings and sacrifice sin you have not taken any pleasure."
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Not only did he not like it when they gave it, he said he found no pleasure.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   Verse 7, "Then I said, 'Behold, I have come in the scroll of the book it is written of me to do your will, O God.'
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   And after saying above, 'Sacrifice an offering, then whole burnt offerings, and sacrifice for sin you have not desired,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   nor have you taken pleasure in them, which are offered according to the law.'"
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   In case anybody was thinking that the burnt offerings, they didn't follow the rules.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   And that's why.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   I told you to give a goat offering, you gave a lamb.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   I told you to give a bull, but you gave this.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   He said, "No."
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   He said, "They followed the law."
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   They did what God told them to do.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   Then why is he saying he finds no pleasure in them?
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   Why does he say there's no pleasure in all of that?
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   In fact, one of the harshest rebukes toward the nation of Israel is written in the book of Amos and Isaiah.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   And their sin was superficial worship.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   In Amos chapter 5, 21-23, listen carefully to the rebuke of Israel.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   "I hate, I reject your festivals."
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Who commanded these festivals?
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   God did.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   And yet God says, "I hate, I reject your festivals, nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies."
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   Why were they assembling?
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   Because God told them to assemble.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   "Even though you offer up to me burnt offerings."
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   God commanded the burnt offerings.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   "And your grain offerings."
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   God commanded the grain offerings.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   "I will not accept them.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Take away from me the noise of your songs."
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   The worship songs that you are singing.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   The guitar that you are playing.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   He doesn't say, "Oh, you're worshipping me."
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   He says, "No, they are noise to me.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   I will not even listen to the sound of your harps."
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   Man, that's harsh.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   And you can dissect all of this and say, "Well, they're just following your instruction.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   We're assembling because you told us to assemble.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   We're singing because you told us to sing.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   We're sacrificing because you told us to sacrifice."
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   Then why do you reject this?
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Again, it's in Isaiah 1, 12-14.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   "When you come to appear before me, who required of you this trampling of my courts?"
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   We just automatically assume because we're gathered, he must be pleased.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   I mean, at least we're sucking it up.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   I mean, this is not easy, right?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   I mean, we're pretty soft Christians here in the United States, but this is hard business.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Right?
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   And so, we must be godly.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   We just automatically assume if I showed up, God is worship.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   But he said, "Who required of you this trampling of my court?"
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   He called their corporate worship trampling.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   "Bring your worthless offerings no longer.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   Incense is an abomination to me.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   New moon and Sabbath are the calling of the assemblies.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I cannot endure iniquities in solemn assembly.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feast.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   They have become a burden to me.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   I am weary of bearing them."
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   Every little thing that he mentions in this text are things that he commanded the nation of Israel,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   and yet he says, "I hate them."
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Why?
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Because God didn't ask for sacrifices because he was a connoisseur of dead meat.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   God didn't tell them to assemble because he liked his people coming and he wants to hear good music.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   He didn't like the smell of barbecue.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   That was not the reason why he set this up.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   All of this was a shadow to point to the reality that we can only find in Christ.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   And what the Jews did was they gathered together and was going through the motion and checking off the list
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   and thinking that that made them righteous before God.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   And God says, "Your superficial worship to me is a burden."
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   It does nothing other than blind us to think that we're righteous.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   Our sacrifices, our giving, our leadership, our singing, all of that in God's eyes become a burden
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   because it fools us to think that we are more righteous than we really are.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Sometimes those people who've been raised in the church in good Christian homes are the first ones to be blinded.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   Those who have positions in the church as leaders in the church are the first ones to be blinded
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   because we automatically assume that our title, our position, our work somehow makes us more righteous before God.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   But what God desires more than anything else is true worship.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   What he wanted was worship, not the assembly, not the sacrifice, but worship.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   Hosea 6, 6, "For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offering."
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   When was the last time you pursued God?
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   We always say God pursued us, but when was the last time you were hungering and thirsting for God
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   and you wanted Him and you wanted to know what He had to say
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   and you went to the scriptures because you wanted to hear from Him,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   not because you were accountable to the small group that you were at,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   not because you're a small group leader, not because of the title,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   not because there's a test coming up, but because you wanted to know God.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Because you wanted to worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   He says the whole purpose of the tabernacle was to instill in us a hungering and thirsting
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   that we may come to Him to give Him true worship.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   And that's why in Hebrews 10, 15-16, the new covenant is described this way.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   And the Holy Spirit also testified to us for after saying,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   I will put my laws upon their heart and on their mind I will write them."
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   In other words, worship.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   It is what is God doing in our hearts that we express through our mouth is what God desires.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   That's why when He encountered the Samaritan woman and say,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   "Well, you Jews worship on that mountain," but we say, "With that mountain,"
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   and Jesus stops her right there.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   They worship and they may have the truth and you may think you have the spirit,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   but what God is looking for are people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   It is not enough that you and I learn the Bible week after week.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   In fact, we can easily be fooled because the Word is getting into you that that's enough.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   You know more than other Christians.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   You study more than other Christians.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   And all that will do is to give you false confidence that somehow you're more righteous than other people
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   if the Spirit of God is not moving you to worship,
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   if the Word of God is not causing you to be broken over your sins
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   and broken over the sins of the world,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   and it doesn't cause us to reach out with the gospel,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   and all it has done is added information after information after information.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   What God desires is in spirit and in truth to worship Him.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   And that's what the shadow was for.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   So now we come to the new covenant.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   In Romans chapter 1, chapter 12, didn't he say,
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   "In view of the mercy of God to present your body as a living sacrifice."
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   So let me wrap this all up with this.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   In the Old Testament, all the sacrifices fall into two categories,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   the mandatory offering and the freewill offering.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   The mandatory offering is required.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   You cannot get to the presence of God unless there's a burnt offering or whole offering or sin offering or guilt offering.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   Those offerings had to be made in order to have a relationship with God.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   And then there was the freewill offering.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   It was when God blessed you or just out of the abundance of your heart,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   you just wanted to thank God.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   And so it was not mandatory, but you voluntarily brought things to God and you worshiped.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   In the new covenant, the mandatory offering is complete in Christ.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   So when Jesus was dying on the cross, it says, "It is finished."
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   He's saying that the mandatory offering, what is mandated for us to come to God, has been done.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   It is finished.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   So when he requires of us a living sacrifice, he's talking about a freewill offering
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   for us to give to him from our hearts voluntarily.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   So what we do, we volunteer to him because he's done so much for us.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Out of thankfulness, out of act of worship, we give to him.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   We come to church not because it's mandated,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   because I want to express to my God what he has done for me.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   I cannot begin to understand why he puts up with sinners.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   And if there's any mystery that I just cannot figure out is, why does he love us?
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   I don't get it. I really don't get it.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   I mean, I've said this many times, but I don't have any compassion for cockroaches.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   None. Zero.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   Because it adds nothing to my life.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   It's a burden.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   It's disgusting.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   And it's not because it brings disease. I just don't want it.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   I think about our relationship with God and how we so easily get distracted,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   how easily we complain because we didn't get what we wanted,
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   how easily we just get bored.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   Everything else in this world seems so exciting, but God sometimes is bored.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   Why does he put up with this?
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   I mean, just not to crush us.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   That in and of itself is a mystery.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   Why doesn't the earth just explode? Enough of this.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   These people burning Bibles and questioning me.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Boom. Done.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   Just create something else. Do it over.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   I know he promised that he would never crush us again with the flood, but he's God.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Once we're gone, who's going to question him?
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   No, you said it's a start over.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   Why not? I would have done it.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   You would have done it.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   I don't get it.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   I understand hell.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   I don't know about you, but I understand hell.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   I mean, you can understand. I think you and I do understand hell.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   Why an almighty God would create hell. I get it.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   He's God. You mess with him, you get hell.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   I get that. I don't get heaven.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   Why does he choose to show mercy to us?
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   Why does he give his only begotten son for our sins?
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   And that will remain a mystery to me.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   And I'm not sure if I get to heaven that is going to be answered.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   I'm not sure.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   But the glimpse of what I have seen in him, there's nothing.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   There's nothing on earth that compares.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   I pray with all my heart.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   That as Christians living in this fallen world,
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   with all the distractions,
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   with all the things that make us uncomfortable,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   that we would never lose the fact,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   lose the mystery of what it is that you and I sing every single Sunday.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   That it's not just empty words.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   The mystery of the cross, I cannot understand.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   I pray that that mystery would cause us to persevere, endure,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   to be bold in sharing the gospel, and be the light that God called us to be.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   Let's pray.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   Father, we just want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   Lord, you know my sins better than I do.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   You know our weaknesses.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   Even now, Lord God, as we come to worship you,
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   you know the burdens that we carry.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   You know the distractions and the temptations, bitterness, Lord,
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   we harbor in our hearts, the anger that we refuse to let go of.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   Forgive us.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   what he has done, what he has endured, the grace that he's given us,
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   that we may have this life and have this life abundantly.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   That everything that we do may be a reflection of that grace you've shown us.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   I pray, Father, that through the shadow,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   that you would cause us to hunger and thirst for the reality.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   As we remember our sins, that we would remember, Father God,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   that only you can forgive us and cast away our sins.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   That it would cause us to worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   May your name be glorified in all things.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   Okay, can we all stand together again for a closing praise?
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   [music]
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   Christ the true and steady anchor
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   In the fury of the storm
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   When the winds of doubt blow through me
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   And my sails have all been torn
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   In the suffering, in the sorrow
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   When my sinking hopes are few
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   That shall never be broken
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   Christ the sure and steady anchor
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   While the tempest rages on
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   While temptation claims the battle
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   And it sings, the night has won
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   Deeper still thankful's the anchor
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   Though I justly stand accused
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   That shall never be broken
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   Christ the sure and steady anchor
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   Through the floods of unbelief
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   In the storm, oh my soul now
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   Lift your eyes to Calvary
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   And this my ballast of assurance
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   See His love forever prove
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   That shall never be removed
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   That shall never be removed
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Oh, never be removed
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Christ the sure and steady anchor
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   As we face the wave of death
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   When destroyers hand way to glory
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   As we draw our final breath
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   We will cross that great horizon
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Clouds behind and life's secure
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   And the calm will be the better
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   For the storms that we endure
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Christ the sure of our salvation
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   Ever faithful, ever true
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   We will hold fast to the anchor
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   That shall never be removed
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   [instrumental]
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   Let's pray.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   Heavenly Father, I pray for your blessing upon our church,
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   those who are at home and those who are here,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   that you continue to unite our hearts together as one,
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   as we worship you and honor you.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   Help us, Lord God, as iron sharpening iron,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   that we would lean on one another as we depend upon you.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   And wherever it is that you send us,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   whether in eating or drinking, may it be done for your glory.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   eternal love of God the Father, rest, restore, sanctify,
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   and strengthen your church for the sake of your name.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   Amen.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   [instrumental]
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   God sent his Son,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   then called him Jesus.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   He came to love,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   heal and forgive.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   He lived and died
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   to bind my pardon.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   An empty grave is there to
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   my Savior lay.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   Because He lives,
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   I can face tomorrow.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   Because He lives,
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   all fear is gone.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   Because I know
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   He holds the future.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   And life is worth the living
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   just because He lives.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   All right, as we exit, if we can ask you guys from the back
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   to go out that way first, and then there are plenty of shades
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   on the front of the building, so you guys can kind of go over there
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   and hang out as well.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   And for those of you who are in this middle section,
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   if you guys can help us just pick up the chairs
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   and then just put it up on the shelves before you leave.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   All right, thank you.
