[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Father, we thank you.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.600]   Thank you for what we have.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.160]   Thank you for your living Word.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.280]   Thank you for the ability to be able to spend time together with brothers and sisters.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.640]   We know, Father God, that you said that we have all things that we need for life of godliness
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.320]   in the knowledge of your Son, Jesus.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.680]   So we pray that you would help us, Lord God, to know him more.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.560]   Not only what he has done on the cross, but all the preparation, all the symbolisms, all
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.480]   the foreshadowing that you placed in the Old Testament and how ultimately, Lord God, that
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.960]   it was to prepare us for him.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.280]   I pray that you would help us to understand the depth of your heart, depth of your will
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.320]   and plans, Lord God, that more and more that our hearts and our lives, our minds may be
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.160]   gripped by these things.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.920]   Lord, the power, Lord God, to distract us in this world is so strong and so heavy.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.480]   You know, Father God, how easily we can straddle both the things that are eternal and things
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.560]   that are temporal and just click on back and forth, Lord God, and how frustrating that
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.160]   is.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.280]   We are desperate, Father God, for your power to grip us, that we would move beyond just
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.040]   routine, just going through the motion, but our very passions, our desire, our worship
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.060]   may be you and you alone.
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.480]   So we pray for your grace this evening.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   Amen.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.600]   All right, today we're going to be looking at chapter 23.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.640]   It's going to be mainly dealing with the seven festivals that God commanded to the nation
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.480]   of Israel.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   We could have probably just spent just a whole day just on one of these festivals because
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.000]   there's so much involved, not only the details of the meaning behind it, but how it's fulfilled
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   in Christ.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.360]   And in every one of these festivals, there's a clear fulfillment in Christ, and there's
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320]   so many passages in the New Testament that we could have covered.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.520]   Like Jesus mentions it in the book of Revelation and the Gospels, and Paul brings it up.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.120]   So as I was preparing, the study was just getting longer and longer and longer, and
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.600]   there's just no way that I would have been able to sit there and talk about each one
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.560]   of these things in that detail, and so nor did I want to just kind of skim over it.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.400]   So the way I organized it today is the seven festivals, and kind of give you an overarching
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.440]   reasons behind what He did and how it points to certain specific things.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.360]   So we are going to go into some of the details, but again, if you study thoroughly through
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.320]   chapter 23, there's a lot of little things that are mentioned there that I'm just not
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.120]   going to mention in today's Bible study just because there's a lot of things to cover,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.240]   and I'm just going to give you a large overview.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.240]   So I'm going to mention the significant things, but again, I'm not going to be able to go
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.280]   into too much detail.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.120]   So to jump right in, the chapter begins with the command to observe the Sabbath on a weekly
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   basis.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.520]   So in verses 1, 2, and 3, before He gets into the seventh feast, starting from chapter
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.320]   4, He begins with the practice of Sabbath.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.840]   So Sabbath, obviously, is not one of the seventh feasts, but the reason why He gave the Sabbath
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.320]   to the nation of Israel is the same reason why He gave the seventh feast, and this is
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.760]   the only one that He does on a weekly basis, where every single week on Saturday, on the
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.960]   Sabbath, they were to take time off and not engage in work, all for the purpose of renewing
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.760]   their covenant, renewing their relationship with God.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.720]   So restoring the Sabbath, if you, again, you probably may have heard a sermon at our church
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.640]   at some point, is ultimately the purpose of redemption.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.440]   So if you look at the creation account, God creates in six days, and seventh day, He enters
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.520]   the Sabbath.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.100]   So we know that God didn't enter Sabbath because He needed a break and recuperate and start
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.040]   over the next day, right?
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.760]   And a lot of times we think of Sabbath that way.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.080]   The Sabbath, the way it's described in the scripture, is God enters the rest, and He
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.860]   is there permanently.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.360]   And so He brings us into that rest.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.720]   So when sin comes in, that Sabbath that we had in the presence of God is broken, right?
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.600]   So when somebody is in sin, another way to describe it is unrest.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.480]   And that's why, again, when we study the book of Hebrews, He describes salvation as entering
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.160]   the Sabbath, and He says to make every effort to enter into that Sabbath.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.200]   So the practice of Sabbath, ultimately, the restoration of Sabbath, the true Sabbath found
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.620]   in Christ, is another way to describe salvation itself.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.220]   So you can say the whole redemptive history is to bring us back to that seventh day Sabbath
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.920]   that God entered, that was broken when sin came into the world.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.040]   The Sabbath served as a sign between God and His covenant people.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.640]   And details of this are not mentioned all of it in Exodus 23, or Leviticus 23.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.320]   It's all over the book of Exodus.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.440]   It's in the book of Deuteronomy and other parts.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.680]   So I'm going to reference that, but a lot of these things may not be specifically mentioned
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.000]   in chapter 23.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.760]   Then He says, "It is the Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings."
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.880]   So this is commanded by God, that this is something that they were...it was not a suggestion.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.440]   In fact, the penalty for breaking the Sabbath was capital punishment.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.520]   To break the Sabbath and to disrespect the Sabbath basically meant to basically shake
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.600]   your fist at God and saying, "I don't need you."
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.180]   And so it was a very serious thing.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.840]   So even though He lays out these seven feasts and this particular Sabbath, this is not like
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   holiday today.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.940]   It was, "Oh, well, Thanksgiving, we'll celebrate it on Thursday or Wednesday, or I might take
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.480]   a break, not take a break."
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.320]   For the Jews, this was not an option.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.120]   Not working on the Sabbath was mandatory.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.080]   Mandatory meaning like you don't get a slap on the hand.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.360]   It was capital punishment.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   And the seven feasts were to be approached in the same manner.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.360]   That's why He puts His name on it and said, "I am the Lord," meaning that this is not
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   a suggestion.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.520]   This is not coming from the priests.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.440]   This is not a think tank, a group of them had a discussion.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.120]   He said, "God Himself is saying that this is something you need to take seriously."
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.360]   There are seven feasts of the Lord that is mentioned in chapter 23, and these were to
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.400]   be celebrated each year in Leviticus.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.920]   So some of them lasted maybe a week, some of them it was one day.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:50.180]   But collectively, just the seven feasts, if you put it all together, it could have easily
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.880]   gone into several months.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.960]   Today, when we think about Christmas, it's usually one day.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.880]   You might get a whole week off, or a lot of you will get a whole week off, or you have
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.160]   Thanksgiving, you might get Thanksgiving and a couple of days off after that.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.520]   And then you have a few days just scattered, and you put it all together, it might be a
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.520]   total of maybe about three weeks.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.080]   But the Jewish calendar, if you put all of that together, and the seven feasts were only
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.240]   the major things, but there's a lot of other things that they celebrate.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.480]   So if you look at the Jewish calendar, we're talking about a huge chunk of time in their
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.720]   calendar where they took time to remember specific things of God, and this was commanded.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.920]   He said that these feasts are literally called appointed times.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.840]   In the ESV and the NASV, it says it's holy convocation.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.120]   In the NIV, it's called the sacred assembly.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.760]   Basically it means that this was an appointed, sacred convocation that was supposed to be
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:57.480]   set apart each year during this time.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.200]   These times were celebrations, these times of celebration are important not only to Israel,
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   but also to overall message of the biblical narrative.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.580]   So the reason why these seven feasts are so important for us to study is because ultimately
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.520]   it finds fulfillment in Christ.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:19.120]   So there's something about these feasts that helps us better understand what Christ did
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.240]   on the cross.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.920]   So it's not only relevant for Israel's history, but also for us in the new covenant.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.320]   So there's seven specific feasts.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.520]   The Passover is the beginning in the Jewish calendar.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.000]   The Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of First Fruit, Feast of Weeks, oftentimes called
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.320]   the Feast of Pentecost, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Feast of Tabernacle.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:56.760]   And so we're going to be looking at the three significances of these seven feasts.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.280]   So as I mentioned to you, I can go into detail on each one of these feasts and spend the
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.520]   whole day just talking about what the Feast of Tabernacle did and why God commanded that
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.720]   and what they practiced and what did these practices point to.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.880]   And if we had more time, I think it would be beneficial to do that, but to do that we
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.440]   would have to take seven weeks because each one of them has that much material.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.240]   Not necessarily in Leviticus, but if you collect all the other passages, there's quite a bit
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   of material.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.660]   But the way that we're going to be approaching it tonight is to give you an overview of why
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.660]   this is here.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.160]   So there's three significances.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.760]   One is it pointed to a current blessing.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.480]   So every one of these things, these feasts, are attached to some kind of agricultural
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.920]   harvest.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.040]   So it wasn't random, right?
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:54.740]   So if you had a Feast of Tabernacle, they celebrated because of something physical that
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.840]   was happening at that time of the year.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.600]   The second significance was to celebrate historical blessings.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.400]   So every one of these festivals reminded them of some activity of God, something that God
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.040]   did for them.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.220]   And so they took time off to remember.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.200]   And then the ultimate fulfillment, the third, they all had a prophetic message that pointed
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.680]   to the fulfillment in Christ.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.720]   So remember those three, right?
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.540]   So it's connected to some kind of harvest that was going on, and during that harvest,
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:42.700]   they remembered something in Israel's history, right, that triggered that.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.300]   But then the ultimate fulfillment ultimately pointed to what Christ was going to do, right?
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:55.720]   So every one of these feasts had three specific elements.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   So let's look at the first one, the current blessing.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.020]   The feasts all had certain harvests attached to it to be celebrated when to give thanks
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.960]   for fruitfulness and to acknowledge the worship of God for a particular harvest.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:19.280]   Again, the reason behind this is to make sure that whatever physical blessings that they
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.860]   had, that they were to constantly acknowledge their dependence on God.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.440]   So even in the Lord's Prayer, you know how we pray to give us this day our daily bread,
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.920]   and we talked about that last week, how that wasn't just triggered because of the manna,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.580]   that was embedded into the Levitical system that people understood that their daily sustenance
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.920]   was dependent upon God.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:48.080]   And so part of the reason for these feasts was whenever they had the harvest of any kind,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.240]   it would remind them and point them to recognize that they had the rain because of God, that
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.040]   the harvest was fruitful because of God, that they're able to eat and to live and have
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.680]   their being ultimately because of God.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.960]   So it's to acknowledge God, right?
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:16.480]   So these harvests that triggered these feasts, first three of them are spring feasts.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.240]   And the beginning of their calendar usually started somewhere in March and April, right?
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.680]   So the spring feasts, they were Passover, Feast of Unleavened Bread, and Feast of First
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   Fruit.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:34.480]   They were all triggered because of the beginning of the harvest.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   Now so you had the harvest of the wheat, harvest of the barley, and so each one of them are
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:46.400]   attached to a different festival, but overall, the spring feasts were celebrated at the beginning
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.440]   of the harvest.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.120]   So if you know, again, if you study 23, you'll know that Passover is mentioned in verse 4
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.120]   just in passing.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.200]   Nothing is mentioned about it other than you need to celebrate Passover, and then he goes
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.360]   right into the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.080]   And the reason why that is is there's so much teaching on the Passover in other passages,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.300]   it's kind of already embedded into the Jewish culture, right?
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.440]   And so he goes in and gives more detailed instructions about the unleavened bread.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.040]   And oftentimes, the Passover and unleavened bread is mentioned together, right?
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.840]   They'll say a Feast of Unleavened Bread, and they include the Passover because the Passover
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.920]   was celebrated on one day, and then that triggered the Feast of Booths.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.400]   I mean, sorry, Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.200]   So it was celebrated back to back, right?
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.480]   So it happened simultaneously.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.120]   And that's the reason why oftentimes when they say Passover, they're already assuming
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.640]   the unleavened bread.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.400]   But again, all of this was at the Spring Festival.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:55.440]   The Summer Feast was the Feast or the Weeks, Feast of Pentecost, which happened 50 days
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.900]   after the last Spring Feast, okay?
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:10.440]   And it pointed to a wheat harvest, and then the Fall Feast, the Feast of Trumpets, Day
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   of Atonement, Feast of Booths, and all of that pointed to the end of the harvest, okay?
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.760]   So they had the harvesting of grapes or sheep shearing or whatever it may be.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.200]   All of these feasts were specifically related to some kind of harvest that was taking place
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.280]   at that particular time.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.360]   Now why was this so significant?
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:44.880]   So in James 117, it says, "Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.080]   Coming down from the Father lies with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow."
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:58.640]   And so the moment that we forget that whatever good that we have is from God, we become self-dependent,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.560]   self-reliant, right?
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.820]   And we think somehow, "I woke up this morning because I willed myself to do that," right?
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.820]   Now we may think so.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.760]   I mean, there's always theologians that are debating between does man have free will or
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   not, but just logically speaking, there's like a hundred thousand things that needs
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.440]   to be taking place all at the same time just for us to wake up every day, right?
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.120]   Whether it's the sun, whether it's the rotation, whether it's the heat, whether it's the cold,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.560]   whether it's the oxygen, speed of the rotation.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.320]   I mean, there's a hundred thousand things that needs to happen in order for us to live.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:41.140]   So for a man to say, "I willed myself to live," is just supreme arrogance, right?
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.880]   That's why when the Bible says, when God just describes himself as I am, he is truly the
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.440]   only being that is completely independent of anything else.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.160]   He is self-existent.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.960]   Everything else depends on him, right?
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.160]   Not only did he create all things, he sustains all things.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   So if God chose not to sustain it, all of creation would just deteriorate and die, right?
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.440]   And so this was a constant reminder to the nation of Israel of their dependence upon
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440]   God.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think part of the reason why it's harder for us to remember God, you know, people who
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.520]   live in the city, is because we're not dependent upon rain for our sustenance.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.480]   You know, if you happen to live on a farm and raise sheep or grow corn or whatever,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.600]   you know, you're dependent upon things that you can't control.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.640]   So you're constantly like praying before God and then when rain comes, "Thank God you sent
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   rain."
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.920]   But if we have problems, we just find another job.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.960]   We invest better or we find stocks.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.880]   And so everything around us is man-made for the most part, right?
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:54.280]   I mean, obviously even the material here ultimately is made by God, but a man put this together.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.680]   So you know, our tendency is every once in a while we might travel and go up to the mountains
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.480]   and then we say, "Oh, God is so good."
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.340]   But we don't think like that when we're here, right?
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:11.040]   And so the harvest, the festivals was to get them to slow down and to remind them that
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.240]   these ultimately without God, we can't exist.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.400]   And so remember the sin that is mentioned in Romans chapter one, "For even though they
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.160]   knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.360]   speculations and their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.680]   Then to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.200]   image in the form of corruptible man and birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures."
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:41.320]   So everything about the harvest, ultimately it applies to all mankind, whether they acknowledge
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.060]   him or not, right?
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.360]   Because God is the one who created.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:54.100]   So even if they don't acknowledge God as creator, harvest ultimately affects everybody, right?
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.880]   So the first part of it is a reminder to mankind, which Israel is a part of, is a reminder to
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.660]   mankind how dependent they are.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:09.580]   But the second part of it is specific to the nation of Israel.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:15.780]   The feast reminded them of some significant historical event of how God delivered Israel,
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.340]   sustained them, established them as a nation.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:26.720]   So all of it reminds Israel, right, of God's deliverance.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.200]   So let's look at the Passover.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.400]   Now, Passover, a lot of us already know what that is because every time we have communion,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.040]   we're reminded of that, right?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.760]   If you study the New Testament, you know, one of the most important event that takes
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.280]   place in the New Testament is Jesus at the Passover meal says, "Do this in remembrance
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   of me."
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:51.400]   So we know that it celebrated how God spared the nation of Israel by passing over the homes
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.460]   that were covered by the blood of the lamb.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:59.080]   And clearly Jesus' blood represented that blood, right?
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:05.720]   But to the nation of Israel before Jesus came, it was to remind them of how God delivered
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.260]   the nation of Israel, right?
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.220]   And so every time they had the Passover, it was to remind the nation that the only reason
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.960]   why they even existed, why they were independent, and why they became a nation was because God
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.240]   had mercy on them, right?
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.340]   So their thankfulness goes beyond just the harvest.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.340]   They're very sustenant.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.040]   Their nation, their sacrifices, all of it is because God delivered them.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.120]   And that's what the Passover reminded them of.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:38.400]   Feast of Unleavened Bread, right, which happened right after the Passover, it celebrated how
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.380]   God delivered them, right?
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.280]   So during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, they would search the home and make sure that there's
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.240]   no yeast in the house, each representing sin.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.400]   And they were to clean that all out and they had to eat their meal in haste, right?
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   And there was no yeast.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.980]   And so every time they did that, again, it was they acted out how God delivered the nation
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.800]   of Israel, how they didn't have time.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.080]   So they didn't have time for the yeast.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   And so they hurried and ate in haste.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.360]   And so every time they celebrated that, it reminded them not only the Passover, but how
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.840]   God physically led them out of Israel.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.320]   Feast of Firstfruits.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.400]   Feast of Firstfruits was to remind the nation of Israel that despite them out in the desert,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.720]   when they came into the promised land, God caused them to be fruitful.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.600]   And the first harvest that they dedicated to the Lord was what this thing pointed to,
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   right?
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:46.360]   That not only did God deliver them by covering over them by the blood of the lamb, not only
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.560]   did he deliver them in haste out of Egypt, but even after they left, God provided for
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.560]   them miraculously.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   And so the Feast of Firstfruits reminded them of God's caring sustenance for them.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.000]   So when they gave their offering, it was to say, "All of this is because you gave this
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.880]   to us," right?
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   And that was the Feast of Firstfruits.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:24.640]   Okay, we're going to come back to that later.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:34.880]   The Pentecost, or the Feast of Weeks.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.040]   This celebrated the inauguration of the Mosaic Covenant.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.840]   The word Pentecost literally means 50.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:47.480]   And the reason why they celebrated this, again, the historical aspect of it, was that 50 days
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.040]   after they left Egypt was when Moses goes up to Mount Sinai and he receives the law.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:00.360]   So the Pentecost was the celebration of receiving the Mosaic Law, the first covenant that Israel
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.680]   enters into.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.400]   Now this is really significant because this later on, something very significant happens
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.960]   in the New Testament at Pentecost.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.880]   Some of you guys probably already know, right?
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.920]   The Feast of Trumpets.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.800]   The Feast of Trumpets celebrated the gathering of the nation of Israel.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:28.720]   So not only did God give them, but remember the whole book of Leviticus is about gathering
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.680]   the people around the tabernacle and he begins to call them his people.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.000]   And then they start to get organized.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.360]   And so the Feast of Trumpets, either they blew trumpets to give some sort of a command,
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.620]   or it was a declaration of something, or a calling.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.720]   So when they blew the trumpets, everybody heard it, it meant that everybody was to gather.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.240]   So Feast of Trumpets was to remind them that they were God's people.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.920]   When God blows a trumpet, the people of God hear his voice in the New Testament and we
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.920]   follow him.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.600]   So the trumpet was meant to signify God's voice that people hear and then they gather.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.120]   And so that's what that pointed to.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.840]   And then you guys know about the Day of Atonement.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.720]   We studied this earlier, I think it was chapter 16.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   It celebrated his forgiveness.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.120]   The establishment of the tabernacle, it was basically cleansing of sin of the nation
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:30.560]   of Israel, which made it possible for them to have a relationship with this holy God.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:37.880]   That was the Feast of Day of Atonement.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.760]   The Feast of Booths or Feast of Tabernacle.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.800]   This feast celebrated how God sustained them through the wandering through the desert before
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.040]   entering into the promised land.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   So the Feast of Booths, during that time, they would basically live in their shack,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:02.120]   a little, you know, made tent and they would sleep in there for a period of time to remember
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.000]   that during the period of wandering the wilderness, how they were nomads, right?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.560]   And during that period of 40 years, how God was faithful to them.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.840]   And so the Feast of Booths was to remind them.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.160]   So all of these events pointed back to something that God did in Israel's history so that they
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.800]   wouldn't forget that the only reason why they're there is because God permitted it and God
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.440]   was gracious to them.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   Now, did I put that up there?
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   Okay.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:47.120]   Let me go back to the verses.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.820]   Why was this so, so important?
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.580]   Because Hosea, Hosea is written, you know, a lot of times people read the book of Hosea
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.880]   and then they say, you know, like, oh, it's a description of the love of God and how despite
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   how Israel continues to sin against God and God continues to follow and God continues
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.360]   to love us and isn't God wonderful, right?
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.480]   All true, but if you read the book of Hosea, Hosea is an indictment against the nation
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   of Israel.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.600]   It doesn't end with God will be forever merciful to all your sins.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.320]   It's a description of his patience and grace over and over again.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.420]   And then he says, despite that, you kept on prostituting yourself with other idols.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.680]   And because of that, you're going into captivity, right?
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.960]   That's how Hosea ends, right?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.280]   That God is gracious, God is gracious, and God is gracious.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.240]   But at some point, if you don't pay attention, this is what's going to happen, right?
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:48.080]   So one of the indictments against the nation of Israel is this, I carefully in the wilderness
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.480]   in the land of the drought, as they had their pasture, they became satisfied.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.160]   And being satisfied, their hearts became proud.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.600]   Therefore they forgot me.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.400]   The problem with the nation of Israel, before they went into idolatry, before they started
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:13.240]   having sexual immorality and chasing after other idols, he said their hearts became proud.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.880]   And the reason why they became proud is because they ate and they were satisfied, their needs
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.520]   were met, right?
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.760]   He said that was the danger.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.080]   Like when the enemies were on their tail, I mean, revival would break out.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   When a famine would happen, they would cry out to the Lord, right?
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.680]   And when judgment would come and armies would chase them, then that's when they needed God.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:43.800]   But as soon as they ate and peace came, they ate, they became proud, they forgot God.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.120]   And then the moment they forgot God was when they began to pursue after idols.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.600]   Why is this so significant and important?
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:59.880]   Because this is what we struggle with.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.480]   We don't live in a country where there's persecution.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.320]   We're just primarily satisfied.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:14.260]   We know mentally that God is important or else we wouldn't be here.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:21.020]   We know theologically that He ought to be first, but He's not.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:29.480]   We know from studying, from fellowship, that Christ is all in all, that this world is under
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   judgment that He's coming.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   We know all of that.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.760]   We acknowledge all of that.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.320]   But it just isn't important.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.080]   It's just not priority in our lives.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.920]   And the reason why is because we are full, right?
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.960]   And sometimes God allows us to be hungry just so that we can be desperate before God.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.200]   And again, obviously, I'm not just talking about being hungry physically, right?
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:07.860]   Being hungry financially, socially, in all kinds of ways where we sense desperation.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.080]   Because until we sense desperation, we don't cry out to God.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.160]   And that was a constant problem with the nation of Israel.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.960]   It wasn't that they were like, they were, you know, it just didn't make sense.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.720]   Like God would do some great miracle and the next chapter we see them worshiping idols,
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   right?
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.880]   Like, why would they do that?
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.480]   Why would they just cross the Red Sea, right?
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:33.200]   Miraculous sea, and then they're on the other side and they make the golden calf.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.660]   That didn't just happen.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.840]   As soon as the desperation disappeared, as soon as the army stopped chasing them, they
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.760]   were satisfied and when they felt safe, they became proud.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.960]   When they became proud, they forgot God.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.000]   When they forgot God, they'd start chasing after idols, right?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.440]   And that's a pattern that is, we're constantly in danger because when we are lukewarm, right?
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:06.820]   When we are lukewarm, it opens the door to all kinds of idolatry in our hearts.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:14.520]   Whether it's sexual immorality, whether it's lust for the world, or just materialism, bitterness,
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.680]   anger, all of that creeps in, right?
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.640]   All of that creeps in when we become idol in our hearts toward God.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.400]   This is why this is so important.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.720]   God was trying to protect the nation of Israel from idleness, right?
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.560]   To constantly remind them, you're here because of God had mercy on you and don't forget that.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:41.360]   And the reason why is like every Sunday, not Sunday, Saturday, every Sabbath, they were
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   to remember this.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.520]   And then if that wasn't enough, he put chunks of time, seven days, 14 days, right?
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.560]   They gave sacrifices and they weren't allowed to work at all.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.080]   It wasn't just a part-time thing.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.180]   When they celebrated these things, he said, "God forbid them to do any heavy lifting."
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.400]   Because he wanted to make sure that they focused all their attention on this.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.720]   That it wasn't just a side project, right?
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.760]   It wasn't just Thanksgiving.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.320]   We had breakfast and the rest of the day we do whatever we want.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.120]   He wanted to make sure all of those days, all of that time was dedicated to this because
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.000]   it was that important because this was their constant problem, right?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.120]   Deuteronomy 2, "You shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you in
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.920]   the wilderness these 40 years that he might humble you," right?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.840]   So again, whole reason is because they become proud.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.360]   Remember how you got here, to humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.280]   whether you would keep his commandments or not, right?
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.840]   So this was not just a holiday for them to take a break so they can, "Oh, holiday's coming
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.480]   up so let's take a trip."
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.880]   This was a sacred, it was kind of an extended time of worship.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:31:01.880]   [silence]
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:09.320]   But ultimately, the feast pointed to the future hope in Christ.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   So all of these things were significant.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.160]   Remember the first one was significant to all mankind, right?
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.320]   All mankind are dependent upon him for the harvest, right?
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.360]   We call that common grace.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.440]   Rain falls upon the Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.920]   The harvest comes for the Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.040]   And all of it depends on God, right?
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.000]   The second meaning of it, specific to the nation of Israel, that they exist because
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.720]   of what God has done.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.920]   And the moment that they forget that, they become satisfied, they become proud, and then
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.600]   they forget God and then they turn to idolatry.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.240]   But the ultimate and the most important part of it is to all mankind, specifically in the
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.200]   new covenant, right?
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.160]   So the first three pointed to Christ's death and resurrection.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.800]   So if you know, the Passover was replaced by the communion table.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.320]   That because the blood of Christ covered us, that the wrath of God passed over us.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.920]   And that was the significance of the Passover.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.600]   And it is crystal clear that that's what it was for.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.200]   And that's why Jesus says before he goes to the cross, "From this day on, do this in
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   remembrance of me."
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.440]   So think of it as a Jew.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   One of the most sacred days out of the year was the Passover.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.680]   And Jesus is sitting there saying, "This was about me."
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:32.080]   So if you didn't believe that Jesus was God, that would have been blasphemous.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.960]   That's just like if somebody came in and said, "You know what?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.880]   You've been worshiping for a thousand years.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.280]   Let this Sunday be about me.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   Worship me.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   Do this.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.920]   Sing about me now."
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.160]   Right?
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.360]   Like memorizing scripture, Bible study, like do it all.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   It's about me.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.380]   Imagine if Jesus wasn't God, how arrogant that would have been.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.080]   But that's exactly what Jesus said.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.880]   "Do this Passover now in remembrance of me."
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.720]   Because all of that pointed to what Christ was going to do on the cross.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:10.720]   So the Passover ultimately pointed to his fulfillment.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.480]   The Feast of Unleavened Bread, it pointed to how God redeemed us from the bondage of
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.960]   sin and death.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:26.720]   And if you remember, most of what Christ does on the last week of his existence happens
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.040]   during this festival, Passover and Unleavened Bread.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.080]   And if you remember, during the Unleavened Bread, as I mentioned, one of the things that
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.840]   God told him to do is to make sure that there is no yeast in the house.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.160]   So it pointed to the fact that they had to leave in haste.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:51.000]   And God, because of the blood of the lamb, death passes them over, and God delivers them
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.640]   from bondage to freedom.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   That's what the Unleavened Bread festival is about.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.240]   And in this festival, they are to eat in haste, to hurry up and leave, and then to clean out
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.220]   the yeast, the sin.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.340]   And that's exactly what Christ does.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:13.840]   He comes and he delivers us from the bondage of sin, sin and death, and delivers us to
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.840]   new life.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.360]   And that's what this festival ultimately pointed to.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:25.600]   Not only does he cover us so that the wrath of God does not kill us, but then he delivers
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.440]   us that we were once slaves to sin, now we've become slaves to righteousness because of
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   what he's done.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.880]   So this Unleavened Bread festival pointed to that.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.360]   The Feast of First Fruit points to Christ's resurrection and how he is the first among
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.240]   the dead.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.100]   Because of what Christ has done, he dies for our sins, he delivers us, and then he's resurrected
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:56.600]   on the third day, and then he says he's the first fruit of many.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.960]   So that's why when you get baptized, we always say, "Do you understand you're going with
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.600]   Christ in his death, right?
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.440]   United with Christ in his death and united with Christ in his resurrected life."
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.280]   And that's what this first fruit symbolizes.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.740]   It points to a new life that we have in Christ.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:20.440]   So in 1 Corinthians 15, 20, is this it?
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.520]   So ultimately in Colossians 2, 16, 17, it says, "Therefore, no one is to act as your
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.280]   judge in regard to food or drink in respect to festivals or new moon, Sabbath, day, things
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.560]   which are mere shadows of what was to come, but the substance belongs to Christ."
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.920]   I should have read this in the beginning, but I couldn't fit it in my outline.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.840]   But you know what I'm saying, that this is ultimately, all the festivals point to the
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.160]   fulfillment in Christ.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.200]   And then this is the passage, "But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.680]   of those who are asleep.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.360]   For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead."
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.720]   So as Christ was the first fruit, we will along with him be resurrected.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.400]   And that's what the first fruits, feast of first fruits ultimately pointed to and fulfilled
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:10.280]   in Christ.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:16.880]   The summer festival is the Pentecost, was the inauguration of Christ's church.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.840]   Remember what we talked about, the Pentecost means 50, because it commemorated not only
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:30.200]   the harvest festival for the summer, but it pointed to receiving of the Mosaic law.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.840]   Fifty days after they leave Egypt, Moses goes up to the mountain and he receives the law
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.360]   and the new covenant is established with the nation of Israel, the Mosaic covenant.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:50.080]   What happens at Pentecost in the New Testament?
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.800]   Acts chapter 2.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.440]   The disciples are gathered together and the Holy Spirit comes upon them and people think
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:01.280]   that they're drunk, but it's the Holy Spirit and as they are speaking, everybody understands
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.920]   it in their language and the new covenant is established on what?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.560]   At the Pentecost.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   So the first Pentecost in Exodus was the receiving of the first covenant, right?
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.000]   The second Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 is the receiving of the new covenant in Christ.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.480]   So the Pentecost ultimately pointed to the new covenant fulfilled in Christ, right?
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   How many of you knew that?
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   A few of you.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.880]   Some of you guys are just tired.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:42.640]   I mean, it's hugely significant.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.560]   So this, let me just spend just a little bit more time here, because if you read Leviticus
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:56.160]   chapter 23, you will find that at the Pentecost, every offering was given except for the guilt
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.400]   offering, right?
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.440]   The burnt offering, peace offering, there's a sin offering, grain offering, they were
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   all offered.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:10.960]   The only one not offered is the guilt offering, because the guilt offering was when you violated
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.600]   something, you became unclean, right?
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:25.820]   But every other offering was given for this, because it was fulfilled in Christ, right?
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.720]   And then this offering, they were to waive, right?
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:33.820]   A waive offering were a separate class of offerings given to God as a show of servitude
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:41.080]   or peace and commitment, which is what that new covenant symbolized, right?
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.720]   Because the old covenant was of the law of blessings and curses, the new covenant was
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.720]   of peace, right?
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.640]   And it is at this covenant, at the end of this covenant, it says, "God ordered not to
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.660]   reap the corners of the field, nor gather the gleaning of their harvest.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.640]   They were to be left for the needy and the aliens."
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.560]   Now you knew about this teaching, because he mentions it before, but did you know that
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.640]   this was part of the feast of Pentecost?
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.240]   He embedded into their feast.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.000]   So God wasn't just being generous.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.800]   Yes, he was gracious and he was merciful, he cared for the aliens, all that is true,
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.880]   but he embeds this into the Pentecost because the new covenant was going to be symbolized
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.080]   by his mercy, right?
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.600]   It was part of the Pentecost celebration, right?
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.160]   You get the significance of all of this?
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   Yes?
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.120]   Just nod your head, let me know that you're following.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.560]   Okay, three of you, thank you.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.640]   Okay.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   Do you really?
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.100]   Because this is huge, right?
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.280]   This is not random.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:58.120]   God placed this into the Pentecost celebration and ultimately points to the new covenant
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.880]   in Christ that's established in Acts chapter 2, and what characterizes this new covenant
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.640]   is peace and mercy, where the old covenant was of the law, right?
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.400]   Of blessing and curses.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   Let it sink in, it's huge.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:27.280]   For the sake of time, I'm not going to read it, but basically it talks about the new covenant
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.720]   versus the old covenant.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:37.000]   The verses on your sheet.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.440]   The fall festival ultimately pointed to the future fulfillment of our Savior when he comes.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.400]   So we looked at the first three, the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and Feast of
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   Fruits.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.600]   These are things that Christ established in his death, right?
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.520]   And his end resurrection.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.180]   The summer feast, it represented the inauguration of the church and the new covenant.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:03.880]   And then these last three feasts ultimately pointed to fulfillment in Christ.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.360]   Because the Feast of Trumpets points to the future gathering of his people at the resurrection.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.680]   So let me get to the verse.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:21.440]   So 1 Corinthians 15, 52, it says, "In a moment, in the twinkle of an eye, at the last trumpet,
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.160]   for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be chained.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.520]   For the perishable must put on the imperishable and this mortal must put on immortality."
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.180]   So this is talking about the resurrection from the dead, right?
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.800]   This is talking about that our own resurrection that's going to be fulfilled in Christ.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.360]   And then he says, "When that trumpet sounds, we will be raised from the dead."
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.260]   It's talking about future, right?
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:58.540]   So the Trumpet Festival, okay, the Trumpet Festival pointed to our own resurrection,
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.580]   ultimately.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.860]   The Day of Atonement celebrates when sin and its effect will one day be completely wiped
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.760]   out.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:13.580]   So we know that the Day of Atonement in Israel's history, they were to basically clean house
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:19.620]   and it symbolized all of the sins of Israel being cast out, remember, with the two goats.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:25.140]   One is slaughtered, the other one representing the sin of Israel is let out, right?
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:32.780]   Meaning that it's being cast out into like a way outside the camp, right?
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:42.100]   Ultimately, in Revelation 21, 4-5, it says, "And he will wipe away every tear from their
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:47.260]   eyes, and there will no longer be any death, there will no longer be any mourning or crying
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.420]   or pain.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.900]   The first things have passed away.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.740]   And he who sits on the throne said, 'Behold, I am making all things new.'
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:59.700]   And he said, 'Write, for those words are faithful and true.'"
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:05.940]   So the Day of Atonement, even though obviously it points to our sins being atoned for by
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.580]   the blood of Christ, but sin being completely cast out.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.060]   Has that happened?
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.980]   It started, but not completely, right?
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.700]   That's why we are saved, but we're also being saved, because we're being sanctified.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:27.260]   We're learning how to remove sin from our lives, and it is at the glorification when
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.880]   the sins will be ultimately and finally removed.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:34.820]   And so when sin is finally removed, he says, "There is no more pain, no more crying,
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.820]   no more mourning."
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:42.900]   In other words, mourning, crying, and pain is a direct result of presence of sin.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.300]   So the Day of Atonement ultimately points to the fulfillment that we will have when
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:54.500]   Christ returns, and we are glorified with him.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.780]   And then finally, the Feast of Booths or Tabernacle points to the establishment of a new heaven
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.620]   and new eternal dwelling for God's people.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.700]   You know what's really interesting here is that Feast of Booths, during that time,
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:12.020]   they've put up all kinds of lights, and they believe that when the Messiah comes, that
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:19.300]   the Messiah was going to lead them into new heaven and new earth, or what they thought,
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.060]   which meant that they thought that the Messiah was going to come and lead them to conquer
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.660]   Rome.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:30.720]   So they would look at these lights, so they had lights lit up all over the temple.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:36.900]   And it was at this festival where Jesus says, "I am the light."
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.460]   He's telling the people who are waiting for the Messiah to come, "Be the light and overcome."
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.820]   He says, "No, I am the light."
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.900]   But they didn't understand what Jesus meant was that he was going to conquer sin, and
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.000]   he was going to deliver them from their own sins.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.780]   And when they couldn't accept that, they ended up crucifying him.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:59.860]   So during this period, people would live in booths, and then they would expect the Messiah
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.920]   to come.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:07.060]   So now they're living in houses, but they wanted to live in mansions.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:11.540]   The scripture says the fulfillment is ultimately, again, in Christ.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:19.640]   Revelation 21, 10-11, "And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain,
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.340]   and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   glory of God.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:30.380]   Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone crystal clear jasper."
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.900]   So ultimately, the Feast of Booths pointed to the new heaven and new earth that was going
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:41.580]   to come, that our holy dwelling is going to be much better, much more glorious than you
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.840]   and I can possibly imagine.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:49.580]   So think about how much hope that we place on saving money, buying a house, getting a
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:56.620]   better car, retirement, and all of these things, so trivial in light of the eternal dwelling
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:02.420]   that he's going to bring in the new heaven and new earth.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:08.100]   Even if your most wildest imagination was fulfilled on this earth, when the new heaven
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.380]   and new earth comes, it's going to look like rubbish.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:16.780]   And so that's what the Feast of Booths was to point to, ultimately it was going to point
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   to when sin is wiped out, right?
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:27.420]   If you live in a mansion and you are surrounded by criminals and sin inside the house, right?
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.860]   What makes a home home?
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.460]   Because you feel comfortable.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:37.780]   But if your home is in turmoil, people are fighting, there's jealousy, division, like
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.260]   you want to live in that mansion?
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.140]   Right?
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:47.020]   I mean, just because it's big and it's comfortable, it's like, no.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.240]   You're never going to feel home until sin is wiped out.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.420]   And that's what Christ said he was going to do, right?
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:57.940]   When the effects of sin are wiped out, the new home and the new dwelling he's going to
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.900]   bring is going to be a place without sin.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.540]   So it's not about the building, right?
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.620]   It's not about the comfort.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:10.800]   It's about the absence of sin that only Christ can establish, right?
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.140]   You see why these seven festivals are so, so, so, so significant?
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.140]   And so think about it.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:21.340]   Think about, like, God knew their tendency to wander and forget.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:25.260]   That's why the Old Testament's over and over again said, "Remember, remember, remember,
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.260]   remember," right?
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:31.220]   Like, if you look at our Christian lives, how much of our Christian life becomes mundane
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.820]   because it's become old, right?
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.640]   The same things don't affect us.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.860]   And it's not because it's not glorious, like, "Ah, we've seen it all.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.860]   We've done it all."
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.500]   It's because we're distracted with entertainment, right?
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.360]   Our stomachs are filled with the things of this world, so by the time we come to God,
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.980]   there isn't much room to observe his glory, right?
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.100]   And so even when we do hear it, we get glimpses of it, but you're not filled with it because
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.460]   you're already filled with other things.
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.940]   And so imagine, like, this wasn't just a few days.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:11.800]   It's like months and months he embedded this into the culture so that even if their hearts
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:16.600]   were not engaged, at least physically God made them.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.780]   Physically God made them to sit down, don't touch anything, and make sure that you never
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.560]   forget this, right?
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:30.020]   So when we come to the New Testament, why do we have Sunday worship?
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:36.220]   Why does it say, you know, not to forsake gathering together as it is the habit of some,
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   right?
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.780]   But consider how to stimulate one another, right?
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.180]   Provoke one another on toward loving good deeds.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.100]   All the more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.660]   Why does he tell us to do that?
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:52.020]   Because that's our tendency to drift and forget, become mundane, right?
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:57.180]   So all the things that God has given us, the church, the leadership, small groups, right?
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:02.900]   The community, Bible study, Sunday school, missions, fellowship, all of that for the
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.640]   same reason God gave all these festivals, so that we would not drift.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.820]   So three questions for discussion today.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:13.980]   Despite all the safeguards God placed in Israel's yearly calendar to keep them sober, their
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.240]   history is filled with them constantly drifting from God.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.700]   Why do you think that was the case, right?
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.300]   And I already mentioned, right, one of the main ones.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.620]   Are there anything else you can think of in Israel's history that caused them to keep
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.700]   going down that path?
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.060]   Is there anything specific that God has done in your life that causes you to be sober and
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.340]   thankful whenever you remember it?
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.580]   So my question at number two, is it your salvation, right?
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.940]   I'm assuming if you're a Christian that that's the number one thing.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.940]   I'm talking about, was there any time, like just like the nation of Israel, when you think
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:51.140]   of something specific where God answered your prayer and clearly God was there when he comforted
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.860]   you and, you know, and I could think about five or six things that, again, not that there's
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:04.180]   only five or six things, but five or six things that I, like, is so distinct and felt so close
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:09.260]   to God that every time I think of it, it causes me to be sober.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:14.340]   And even when I pray now, I always pray, "Lord, I want to know you that way," right?
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.340]   So that's my question.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.740]   That question is not about just general your salvation.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.700]   It could be, but I'm asking, like, are there specific things that you remember when you
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.980]   were broken and God answered your prayer or you needed, you know, his help and God was
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:26.980]   there with you?
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.620]   Is that something that you remember and does that, how does that trigger and how does that
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.660]   cause you to be sober?
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.820]   So that's number two.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:37.460]   Number three, what specific aspect of Christ's second coming do you look forward to and why?
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.700]   Right?
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:44.620]   Does that thought enter your mind on a daily basis that this is temporary, right?
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.360]   That this is, eternity is coming?
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.620]   That everything that you invest on this earth is that eventually it's going to just rot
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.660]   and die?
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.300]   And do you look forward to a second coming?
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.380]   What aspect of his second coming causes you to be sober?
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.380]   Right?
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.380]   So that's my third question.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.380]   Okay?
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.420]   All right, so let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into your small groups.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:14.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Lord God, for lessons that you teach us through
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.700]   the nation of Israel.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:23.900]   Lord when we consider just how much time and effort and energy that you put into preparation
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:29.780]   of coming of Christ and even now, Father God, there's so many things that we know of and
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:35.420]   maybe things Lord God that we may not know of that you are working behind the scenes.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.700]   Maybe not even behind the scenes, things that should be obvious to us, but because of our
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.060]   distractions Lord God, we do not see it.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:47.820]   But we thank you Father that in the midst of all of this that you are patient with us.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:54.740]   We pray Father God that your word and that your plan and your will would ultimately grip
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.560]   our hearts to the point Lord God, where we would be able to confess along with Christ
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:05.380]   that all that we have known, all that we have hoped for in this world truly became rubbish
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:15.220]   I pray that that would not be just a verse that we memorize, but it would be the true
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:18.060]   confession, our testimony.
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:23.100]   So help us Lord God in our discussion to be open, to be honest, that in our weakness that
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.700]   we do not pretend to be something that we're not.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:32.140]   Help us Lord God to confess our sins as you promised that you are faithful and just to
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.180]   forgive us of all our unrighteousness.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:40.100]   That true answer to sin is not our determination but you and you alone.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.180]   So for that reason Lord God, I pray that you would help us in our small groups.
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.020]   In Jesus name we pray, Amen.
