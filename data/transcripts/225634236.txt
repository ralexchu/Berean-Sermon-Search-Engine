[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   All family and friends and for the brothers and sisters to come and celebrate
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.180]   in here and witness the testimony and the baptism of our four brothers and
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.520]   sisters this afternoon.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.360]   Before I pray again, I just wanna give you an encouragement again.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.320]   Every baptism obviously is special.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.240]   We're hearing the story of what God is doing in their life.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.400]   And I know a lot of the brothers and
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.160]   sisters here have played a significant role.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.880]   And some of them coming to Christ and
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.360]   discipling them, encouraging them, walking with them, praying with them.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.520]   And so I wanna thank you for all your labors.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520]   And I think every single one of us who has a testimony can testify that we
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.280]   are here in some way because somebody invested in our lives.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.120]   They share the gospel with us, or they met up with us, or
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.200]   discipled us directly.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.960]   In some way, God always uses people to reach out to people.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.040]   So again, the presence of all of you here is always important for
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.920]   us to, again, not just to hear their testimony, but be a witness.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.600]   We've been sharing on Sundays about confessing our faith and
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.240]   confessing that Jesus is Lord and believing that he was raised from the dead.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.720]   And we talked about one of the significant ideas of confessing is publicly making
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.240]   a covenant with God, and that's what baptism is.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840]   Ultimately, publicly confessing that this is what Christ is doing in their life.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.920]   And so we wanna thank you for coming and
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.160]   again participating here in your testimony.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.040]   So let me pray, and then we'll jump into the rest of the ceremony.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.240]   Gracious Father, we wanna thank you so much for our poor brothers and
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.720]   sisters who are being baptized today, and the work that you've been doing
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   in their lives and in the midst of our church.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.880]   We thank you, Father, for each one of them, and
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.120]   how you've led them through different paths to come to know who you are.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.760]   And as a result, that they're able to be baptized,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.160]   make a public confession of you as Lord and Savior over them.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   And I pray that our time would be fruitful, that we would be encouraged,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.320]   that they would be challenged.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.880]   And again, it would be a great opportunity for
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.360]   all of us to be blessed in the midst of what you're doing.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.520]   So I pray from now until the end that you would be in the midst of us.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:37.960]   >> Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.800]   Before we hear the testimonies of our brothers and sisters,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.160]   I wanna give a brief encouragement from the word.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.560]   I wanna start by reading a passage to you from Romans chapter six,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.120]   a familiar passage during baptism services, speaking of what baptism is.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.080]   And just briefly, in Romans chapter six, starting from verse one,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.680]   that's what shall we say then are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.160]   By no means, how can we who die to sin still live in it?
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.200]   were baptized into his death?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.160]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that just as
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.040]   Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.000]   we too might walk in the newness of life.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.120]   We too might walk in the newness of life.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.200]   Now baptism, as you know, is an incredibly important aspect, service,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.400]   and you can even say, or you should say, the ordinance that we have in the Christian
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.880]   faith, it is not a novel idea that early church fathers brought up.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.120]   It was a command of Christ.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.400]   And as we go and share the gospel, as people are being transformed and
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.880]   converted, the church would baptize those who are entering in to the kingdom of
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   the Lord.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.200]   And today then, as baptism is such a essential core of the gospel,
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.840]   I wanna highlight one aspect of it, just highlighting one aspect of the gospel.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.360]   Okay?
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.560]   I wanna ask a question that I think all of us can relate with.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.920]   Was there ever a time where you wrestled with some kind of addiction or you had a
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.560]   habit that was incredibly difficult to get?
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.800]   Was there ever a time where you felt like, even though you really wanted to,
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.760]   either do something, whether it's go exercise, or not do something,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.160]   whether it's eat too much?
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.320]   Was there ever a time where you felt like you didn't have the power or the control
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.560]   to actually do that in your life?
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.200]   I'm pretty sure all of us can relate to something like that.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   All I have to do is even talk about cell phones or smartphones, right?
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.920]   We try our best not to be distracted.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.960]   We try our best not to waste our time with that thing.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.280]   But in all honesty, it's like an addiction.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   As a matter of fact, the psychology world is very concerned about America because so
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.400]   many people have a deep-rooted addiction to media.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.280]   So they call it media addiction.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.600]   And people are consuming it so much.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.160]   And so the question is, do you deal with that?
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.320]   Do you experience that in your life?
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.360]   And denial is a part of a sign of that addiction.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.880]   If you just think about it, I mean, we want to be in control, but in many ways,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.120]   the smartphone and the media is with us all the time.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.840]   We feel a need to look at it.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.760]   We feel an habitual need to go to it in the morning, sometimes even as soon as we wake
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.160]   up or even before we go to bed.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.360]   We sometimes take it in hiding to look at it, you know, whether it's at work and you
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.040]   take it to the bathroom or something like that.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.120]   All around us and very close to us is this thing.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.800]   And when people, they don't realize they have this addiction, they come to be aware of it
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.880]   when they lose their phone and they're like, "Oh my goodness, I'm naked."
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.120]   They feel this tremendous sense of unease.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.040]   And I can go on about the symptoms, but again, in many ways, we have been controlled.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.440]   We have been controlled.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.080]   I ask that because I'm getting to the core of the question, which is, have you ever felt powerless?
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.840]   Have you ever felt that something outside of you is controlling you?
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.480]   And even though you wanted to, there was a frustration in you because over the period
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.600]   of time, you just can't seem to overpower that thing.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.080]   And in many ways, you probably felt that kind of frustration, not just with media, but other
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   things.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.040]   And I just give this kind of light example of media, but we all actually have deeper,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.760]   maybe more serious and consequential addictions or things in which we feel powerless to.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   For example, there are some of us who struggle to control our anger and our temperament actually
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.080]   feels like an overpowering force in our lives.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.280]   There are some of us who struggle with the opposite maybe of someone trying to take control
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.400]   and angry, but rather the fear where there's a habit of running away, scared.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.680]   Some of us struggle with the habitual nature of lust.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.000]   Some of us struggle, and I can just keep going on, right?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.680]   There are things that are more consequential with increasing severity of negative results.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.160]   And so I ask that by way of asking again, coming to the point of, have you ever felt
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.000]   the frustration of seeing some of these things in our lives and not feeling the power to
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   overcome it?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.680]   I know in a room like this, I'm speaking to both individuals who've been Christian and
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.880]   individuals who are not Christian.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.280]   And this, what I'm talking about now is a universal sentiment where at one point or
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.920]   another we might have felt.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   Why?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.000]   Because to be without Christ, to be without the power of God is to perpetually feel this
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.680]   frustration.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:02.960]   You see, the problem is, although this is a reality, we all know by personal experience
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.840]   and simple assessment of ourselves that our willpower is very weak.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.360]   We all know by the experience of the totality of our lives that just a, "Come on, let's
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   do this.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   Just do it."
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360]   It just doesn't work.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:25.280]   And as a matter of fact, that is the case seen throughout all kinds of different disciplines,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.440]   philosophies and psychology.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.520]   And yet we want to so badly believe in it.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.440]   Believe in it meaning we want to believe in our willpower.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   We want to be able to say that I can pull myself up by my bootstraps.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.720]   And sometimes we have friends who annoyingly come to us and give us that kind of worldview.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.000]   "Ah, you just gotta, just try this.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.720]   All you have to do is just do it.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   Just decide."
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.000]   You know, maybe the parental voice in them is coming out of saying, "Well, did you,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   you know, how come you just don't?"
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.680]   And it just becomes annoying to us because we've already been wrestling with that for
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   so long.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.320]   Have you ever felt this kind of frustration?
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.280]   Now the problem that I'm pointing at is from that frustration, we are going to turn to
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.680]   different things.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.800]   When you feel a lack of power, when you feel that need, you want to change but you can't.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.120]   You are going to turn to certain things.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   And in this generation, we have been taught to trust our will, our willpower.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.400]   You know, we have little idioms where there's a will, there's a way.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:38.080]   It's almost like this, you know, very hopeful, you know, you just hope in the power of mankind.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   I've studied psychology to a certain degree.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.560]   And I think about even the major philosophers and psychologists of our generation, they
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.840]   believe in modification of our behavior by the empowerment of our will.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.400]   Even an individual like Sigmund Freud, he believed that we're, our behavior is produced
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.920]   by a lot of unconscious thinking, a lot of unconscious like structure that we've had.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.440]   So all you have to do is unearth the unconscious.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.800]   And once you are aware of it, you can modify the behavior.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.760]   Well, the thing about it is Sigmund Freud, you know, this genius, you know, rightly so
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.320]   as a human being, he was a genius.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.960]   He had such a horrible addiction.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.760]   He smoked over 20 cigars per day.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.800]   He had cancer in the mouth and the doctors kept telling him, you have to kick this habit.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.160]   His heart was failing.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.920]   And ultimately he died, not because just that, he gave up and asked his physician, would
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.520]   you euthanize me?
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.840]   And he made a very controversial death by asking his physician to do it.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:48.160]   So here's a man who believed we can modify our behavior if we just learn the inside.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.800]   That doesn't work.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:58.120]   You see, the scriptures, God who knows us well is teaching us, you cannot modify your
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.320]   will.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:06.400]   You cannot modify something that is so enslaved, that is so sick, that is so bound and dead
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.280]   that is the way scripture describes us.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.960]   That we're not simply talking about a weakness right now.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.520]   I've been talking about habits.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.640]   I've been talking about bad, you know, habits in your life and things that you feel controlled
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   by.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.200]   More biblically speaking, we have sins in our lives.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.720]   We have passions in our lives and these things dominate us.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.280]   As a matter of fact, one of the first lessons of the word of God tries to teach us is you
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:39.560]   have to realize your willpower is completely insufficient.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:47.360]   And the more you try, the more you exert yourself, you buy into a lie, you deceive yourself.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.200]   You have to come to a point in which you come to the end of yourself in order to actually
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.840]   find help.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.880]   And so one might be saying, my goodness, how am I starting this encouragement, so to speak,
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.760]   from the word?
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   The way I'm starting it is your willpower cannot actually help you.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.600]   Your willpower according to the Bible is weak and dying, is fatally sick.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.700]   Your willpower is enslaved because of the lust of the flesh.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.520]   Your willpower is enslaved because of condemnation.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.000]   Let me take a moment to explain that.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.160]   Earlier I talked about habits, things that we can't seem to control.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.000]   But we don't realize those habits and actions and decisions have incredible consequences
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   because some of our habits, there are things like lust, anger, and they have an offense
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.440]   given to people and to our maker.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.280]   Those things you do not just rectify by your will.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.320]   It's like, oh, I know I offended you.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.160]   I know I hurt you.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.960]   I know I, you know, whatever it may be, you know, transgressed against the law of the
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.560]   state, but by my willpower, I'll fix it.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.600]   You can't do that.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   You cannot do that.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.320]   And you are bound when according to the law of God, even according to even on a humanistic
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.440]   level by the law of the land, if you're culpable and guilty, you are condemned and therefore
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.000]   you are bound.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.520]   You're bound.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.000]   Our will is enslaved because we know no other than that.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.760]   And so my exhortation starting from this is we have to realize that life apart from Christ
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.440]   is incredibly powerless.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.400]   Our wills cannot be trusted.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.960]   Our flesh is too powerful.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.040]   Condemnation is too powerful.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.440]   Then what can we do?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.800]   Have you felt that frustration?
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.760]   Have you felt that moment of feeling like there is no other alternatives?
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.440]   There's no help.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.280]   Well, apostle Paul described that exact same feeling.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.320]   If you have your Bibles, please turn to Romans chapter seven and this very sentiment apostle
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:07.040]   Paul describes, and then he actually gives the answer to the question.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:15.400]   If my will is in such a condition, then where can I turn to whom can I, can I even ask,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.760]   how am I going to find help?
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.480]   And apostle Paul says this, verse 24, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   body of death?
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.920]   There is your frustration and here is your answer.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.360]   Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.640]   And if you jump over to chapter eight, it says there, there is therefore now no condemnation
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.600]   for those who are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the spirit of life has set you free
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.880]   in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.080]   For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.640]   son in the likeness of simple flesh for sin.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.960]   He condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:05.120]   be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to spirit.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.120]   What am I saying?
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:13.280]   What I'm saying is I tried my best to describe a scenario before Christ, whether you have
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.920]   been deceived and duped to think it was possible, the reality is there is no renovation.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   There is no fixing.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.580]   There is no trying to make it any better.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.760]   You can't take rotten fruit and say, well, if we make it bright, vibrant color, it's
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   going to be better.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   No, there is only one destination for that kind of situation.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.660]   You can't simply modify.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:43.040]   You can't say, Hey, let's change, let's change policies and let's make better decisions.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.440]   The life prior to Christ is destined to doom.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.360]   There is no other option but to admit there is no hope here.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.120]   And so what does Christ say?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.600]   Christ did not come in the form of man to renovate.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.920]   He didn't come to repair.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.600]   The message of the gospel is he came to make new.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.040]   And that's why for every single one of these individuals, even in their testimony, you're
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   going to hear it.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.760]   I read their testimony and was incredibly encouraged.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.960]   They've come to the end of themselves, trying all this kind of different stuff, especially
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:24.160]   trying to rely on themselves and realizing there is no repair or minor modification that
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.160]   will help.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.080]   I need to rely on the gospel of Christ where it says because he came as a man, died the
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.920]   death we deserve.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.560]   And therefore, when I die with him, there is the end of the previous life.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.240]   But through his resurrection, I am made brand new.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.680]   That's why in scripture it says, therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.400]   not a modification, not a self-improvement, but brand new.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   Old is past.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   Behold, the new has come.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   That's our hope.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   We're not looking forward to better days tomorrow.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:05.200]   We're looking forward to brand new life by the power of God.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.880]   That's when you can talk about the power of the will.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.160]   That's when you can talk about true change.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:16.120]   That's when you can talk about advancing in life and growth and sanctification, because
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.040]   it's then when God has called us to be new with Christ that he works in our lives.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.440]   Scripture says in Philippians chapter two, that it is God who works in you both to will
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.120]   and to work for his good pleasure.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.920]   This is the hope of the Christian gospel.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:39.320]   When we are in Christ, he will do absolutely completely away with the old and he will grant
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:46.320]   us newness in Christ that we would walk in freedom, not in the feelings of frustration
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   and bondage and slavery, but in freedom in Christ.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   Amen.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.120]   Let's take a moment to pray over them as they come up to share their testimony.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.920]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for the hope of the gospel.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.760]   Lord, it is not like the hope of the world.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.640]   Lord, it is not like the offerings of the world where we could simply try to have temporary
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:18.320]   changes, temporary moments of pleasure, a materialism and some confidence, these fleeting,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.840]   fleeting promises of life.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:27.320]   But God, we thank you that in the gospel of Christ, we have a hope of perfection in Christ,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.640]   of glorification with the Lord in heaven.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.480]   God, that we have a promise far beyond what surpasses understanding.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.480]   Lord, we want to thank you so much for that.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.800]   And God, now as we listen to the stories of four individuals, we pray that you would continue
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.920]   just to magnify yourself through their story.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.360]   We're so encouraged to hear how you've been working in their lives and God for every single
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.320]   person here, may we truly be refreshed in your love.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   Lord, we thank you.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   It's in Christ that we pray.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   Amen.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   The first person I want to invite up is our sister, Emily.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   Hello, everyone.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   For those of you who don't know me, my name is Emily Leung and I'm going to be a junior
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.320]   at UCI from college.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   So like many others, I was born into a Christian home and grew up in the church ever since
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   I can remember.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   My parents were strong believers and emphasized the importance of God ever since I was young.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   And I went to a Christian school until third grade.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   I was active at my home church.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   I remember talking about salvation with my second grade Sunday school teacher and praying
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   to accept Christ one Sunday.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   And in fourth grade, I even made the decision to get baptized.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   I have no doubt that I truly believe that the gospel is true, but I didn't understand
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   how the gospel was supposed to look like in terms of a changed life.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   My walk with God seemed healthy, but as I was regularly attending church, going to Friday
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   fellowship, and even serving various roles on Sunday, but I soon found my faith to be
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   tested.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.320]   As I began transitioning into my adolescent years, the sins I struggled with became more
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   and more apparent.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   I found myself fighting the sins of lust, pride, and a great idolization of worldly
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   forms of success and happiness.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   The more I engaged in sin, the less guilty I felt and the more I was able to justify
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   it in my head.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.320]   I soon became numb to my sin and during my junior and senior years of high school, I
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   would be able to sin with little thoughts of guilt.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.320]   I knew my salvation was in jeopardy, but I pushed it off in my head as something I could
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   go back to later.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   I had no sense of urgency that I could die at any moment and that my salvation was truly
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   at stake.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   I knew I was living in a life of sin and darkness and I was okay with it.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.320]   My pride caused me to keep my struggles to myself and prevented me from being kept accountable
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   by other brothers and sisters.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.320]   When I came to UCI, I was still living in my sinful ways, however, ever since the beginning
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   of college, I also had this desire to find a local church.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   I don't know whether it was because church and Christianity were familiar things in an
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   unfamiliar place, but more likely than not, I saw the very early stages of when my heart
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   was slowly starting to change.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   Early on during my freshman year, I chose to commit to CCM, a Christian fellowship at
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   UCI, and I also began attending brain.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   Halfway through fall quarter, I started doing devotions again and really spent time reading
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   and reflecting on God's word.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   I saw all these positive changes in my walk with the Lord, but, and because of that, I
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   started to think I was saved.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   However, internally, I was still struggling with the same sins that I had struggled with
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   in high school and I often became frustrated.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.320]   The difference was that for the first time in a long time, I did not only feel an overwhelming
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   sense of guilt, but a deep sense of disgust with the way I was living.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   The problem came when I would repent and then give into my sin once again because in my
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   mind, I rationalized it by saying that God is a forgiving God.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   And although this is true, I lacked a true understanding of God's grace.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   I was saying that it was something so cheap that I could turn it on whenever I wanted
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   for my own personal satisfaction.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   Throughout my freshman year, there were many times when I thought I was saved, but only
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   oh so many times when I questioned my salvation.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   However, despite all that, I truly thank God that freshman year was a year of positive
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   growth.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   I was constantly immersed in a community of believers who genuinely cared about me and
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.320]   desired to help me grow.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   More so, I'm so grateful for a Bible teaching church like Berean that taught me things like
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   how to study God's word, what the purpose of the church was, and why surrounding yourself
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   with a body of believers is so important.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   However, knowledge in itself is not enough and my heart had to truly be convicted of
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   my sin before I was able to fully repent and accept God's forgiveness.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   A few weeks into my sophomore year, I began reading Hosea for my devotions.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   The story of Hosea and Gomer truly reflected the relationship I had with God.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   Despite the fact that I had a God who loved me so dearly, I was chasing after idols that
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   I thought could satisfy me.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   The more I read through Hosea, the more I became sick of the way I was living for so
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   many years.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   How much longer must this go on?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   And I knew I was the only one who could change that.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   When I read Hosea 6.3, it really struck a chord with me.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   It says, "Let us strive to know the Lord.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   His appearance is as sure as the dawn.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land."
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   If Jesus were to come again at that moment, what would happen to me?
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.320]   I truly had no certainty of my salvation because I knew that for so long, I was inherently
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.320]   unwilling to give up my old self.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   That's why I kept on engaging in sin, and that's why I found it so hard to stop.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   In addition, I didn't see God as the holy and perfect God that He is, and my low view
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   of God resulted in my low view of sin.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   I remember praying to God during my devotions that day and truly repenting of my life of
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   sin that I had been engaging in for so long.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   I was finally ready to change and to accept Jesus as the Lord over my life.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   I truly believed that He had died on the cross for all of my sins, not just the ones that
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   were supposedly easy to forgive.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   I had to remind myself that Jesus came to save sinners, not those who were perfect.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   I told myself that God's grace and forgiveness is perfectly complete, and since I truly repented
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   in belief, then I could have that peace that I was truly saved.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   That's the wonder of salvation.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   It's so hard to grasp from a human perspective, but it's truly something so beautiful.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   Although this is only the very beginning of my walk with Christ, I truly see a difference
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   in my life.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   Things that I once did out of obligation now have become my greatest joys.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.320]   Whether it be the times I get to spend in prayer or the times I study His Word, I see
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   each of these as a way to draw closer and closer to my Heavenly Father.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   Evangelism was something I once was scared to do, and I can see why I had no desire to
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   evangelize before.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   It was because I didn't completely believe in this wonderful gift of salvation.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.320]   I am now excited to share this joyous message with my friends and family, and I have a deep
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   desire to continue growing into a woman who fears the Lord.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   1 Peter 1, 8-9 says, "Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and even though you
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   do not see Him now, you believe in Him, and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   joy.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   For you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   The joy I have is in Jesus Christ, my loving Savior, and though I know that Christian life
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   is one of struggles and trials, I look forward to this continual process of sanctification
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   until I can see my Savior.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   [applause]
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   I believe you understand by entering into the water, you are uniting with Christ as
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   death, and when you come out, you are uniting with Christ in resurrection.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   Amen.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   Holy Spirit.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   Amen.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   [applause]
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:26:02.320]   Hey everybody.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   For those of you who don't know me, my name is Justin Yee, and I've been coming out
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   to Berean for about six months or so, and yeah, just in these past six months, I can
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   truly say that I've really grown to love this church.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   What began filled with awkwardness and uncomfort has slowly but surely changed into feelings
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   of homeliness and community.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   Being raised in a Christian home, church was always a part of my life.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   My whole family went to church, my best friends were from church, and I spent most of my time
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   there as well.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   I grew up in a typical Asian family, always being taught to be respectful and to be a
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   good kid.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   I attended every year's VBS, and I always went to Sunday school as well as Friday night
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   fellowships.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   This was essentially all I knew, the church.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   But over the years, it became more clear to me that as I matured physically, I never matured
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   spiritually.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.320]   It wasn't clear to me until college, where I realized that my whole life, I knew that
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   I was a Christian.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   I knew what a Christian looked like and what the church was, but I never truly knew Christ.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   I never appreciated what the cross stood for, nor did I understand what it meant to be justified
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   before God.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   I never appreciated the death and resurrection of Christ, and I never looked at scripture
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   as the gift that it is.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   I knew all the right things to say and do, but I never had the heart to glorify a God
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   who deserves my best.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   I prided myself in doing good and looking good, but like everything else in this fallen
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   world, my so-called good morals fell as well.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   I became exactly the person I prided myself on never becoming.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   I remember vividly thinking of myself as righteous because of my good morals and separation
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   from the secular world.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   But in the end, I became a person no different from the world.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   In fact, I was so lost that people were even surprised I identified myself as a Christian.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   I was lost in sin, living a lie on Sundays and living for the world for the rest of the
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   week.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   I had no foundation in Christ, and so I crumbled to the temptations of sin.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   But through this darkness, God's grace abounded all the more.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   Despite being deep in my own selfishness and blindness, God continued to be faithful.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   I will never be able to fathom or understand why God chose to cling on to me when I chose
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   to cling on to the world.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   But I am truly thankful that a God who is so patient and merciful decided to soften
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   my calloused heart and allow me to see myself for who I truly was, a sinner.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   He opened my eyes to show me that I needed a Savior and the life I was living was a path
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   towards death.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   He chose to lead me to the truth and give me a hope that He had something infinitely
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   better for me.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   Looking back just a few years ago, when I believe I first truly became a Christian,
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   I remember how confused in heart it was for me to leaving my sinful life behind.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   I remember so clearly struggling in my heart, wondering, "Why do I still have these desires
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   if I'm saved?"
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   Am I even saved?
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   Is it too late for me?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   Will I ever change?
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   Why do I still long for the world so badly, and why aren't I satisfied in Christ?
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   I remember envying my friends who were able to confidently say, "My hope and joy is in
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   Christ," while fervently praying for God to give me a new heart.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   Fast forward to today and how awesome it is to realize how much has changed and how God
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   has answered my prayers.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   It truly is amazing to see that God can transform hearts, especially when it's your own.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   God has continued to mold me through trials and victories over the past years, and when
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   suffering has been the hardest, His grace has been the most evident.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   Being baptized is a public proclamation of genuine faith and identifying yourself with
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   the death and resurrection of Christ.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   I was baptized in high school, but since becoming a true believer later on, I've always wondered
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   in my heart whether I was truly baptized.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   Through prayer, talking to pastors and brothers, I came to the conclusion that as a Christian,
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   being baptized is what would glorify the Lord the most.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   So today I stand in front of you confidently identifying myself with the death and resurrection
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   of Christ through my baptism, openly proclaiming my hope and joy is no longer in the world,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   but in Christ, fully willing to bear the burdens of the church body, but also sharing and rejoicing
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   with you as well.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   [applause]
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   [indistinct conversation]
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   [applause]
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   Hi everyone, I'm Mallory Kwan and I'm going to be a junior at UCI.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   So I grew up in a non-Christian home.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   My family grew up, or my mom grew up Christian, but she fell away for a while.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   My dad's not religious.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   So I was always able to remember I've always believed in God.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   My mom signed me up for a Christian preschool because she thought it was good for me, but
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.320]   I didn't go to church on Sundays.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   In second grade, my mom signed my brother and me up for Oana at the church where I went
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   to preschool.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   Oana was on Wednesday nights, but I still never went to church on Sundays.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   When I first started going to Oana, I was very excited to memorize verses, sing songs,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   and play with my friends.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   After a while, I went through the motions of seeing and memorizing verses because I
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   did not know what it was all for.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   I just did what my leaders told me to do.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   I did learn the basics of who God is and what Jesus did for us, but I never really thought
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   about the things in my daily life.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.320]   Also in second grade, my dad signed me up for a basketball team that was part of Wintersburg
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.320]   Presbyterian Church.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   This particular team was not the team that I signed up for because there was a mix-up
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   in which team I was supposed to be part of.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.320]   When I found out that I was supposed to join a different team, I was very upset.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   At this time, my heart was very hard and did not take change very well.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   Things had to go my way or else I did not know how to handle the situation and I would
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   get very stressed out.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   Most of the girls on my team grew up Christian and always went to church, while I had not.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   When we got into fourth or fifth grade, my teammates started talking about this one week
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   church camp in NorCal called Mount Hermon.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   I would go there from fifth grade to twelfth grade.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.320]   I had no idea what they were talking about, but I ended up going because it sounded like fun.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   I did not know what to expect going up.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   I thought this camp was going to be like the camp in the movie The Parent Trap.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   Mount Hermon was somewhat like the camp in The Parent Trap, except we would listen to
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   sermons from two guest speakers multiple times a day and then discuss our cabins about them.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   The messages that the pastors preached were also new to me and I learned so much about
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   God and different topics in the Bible.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   But unfortunately, I would forget a lot of stuff that I learned when I came home.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   Every year, Mount Hermon gave me a spiritual high, but I was not able to keep that high
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   for very long, especially since I was not exposed to more Christian people.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   I would only open my Bible up at Mount Hermon and Ilana, but never at my own leisure.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   The summer going into seventh grade at Mount Hermon, everything that I had learned in previous
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   years had all started to make sense.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   Everything started to click and made me realize that I had a purpose and that I did not need
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   to worry about anything.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Even though I realized that, I still did not open my Bible that often, but I opened it
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   a little more often than before.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   That same year, my mom came back to Christianity.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   At this time, she would give me verses to memorize to help me not worry.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   She would also start to take me to church.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   I thought I wanted to go to church, but I did not want to go.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   I used to do nothing on Sundays, so I would be defiant, and that would cause my mom and
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   I to be late to church.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   After a little while, my heart changed and I went to church with no problem.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   But I did not really listen to the message.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   I was zoned out until the service was over.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   I did this until about junior year in high school.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   The summer going into senior year was my last year at Mount Hermon.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   It was the year that the teachings I heard years ago affected my heart.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   That year, I truly believed that I am a sinner and that I do not deserve Jesus' sacrifice
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   because of an exercise I did with my cabin and my brother's cabin.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   Each of us got a rock and labeled it sin to signify that our hearts are full of sin, making
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   our hearts a heart of stone, and only true repentance of our sins would give us a new
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   heart made of flesh.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   I was very convicted after that, and in a time of prayer, I started to clear my heart,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   and I decided that I did not want to keep on living the way I had been living.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   I was living a life where I did what I wanted to do and not what God wanted me to do, which
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   was not pleasing to God because His ways are righteous and without sin, all mine are not.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   I ended up repenting and my heart felt lighter like a weight was lifted.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   From then on, I saw my heart soften.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   I would gladly go to church and pay attention.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   Senior year was when I let God take control of my life.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.320]   I remember that He had a special plan for me and I had to let Him lead me there.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.320]   But my life didn't reflect my beliefs because I still lived pretty worldly.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   This was because as a new Christian, it was easy to fall back into old routines.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   This changed when I got into UCI.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   Going into UCI, I didn't know anyone.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   I thought I was going to be able to make friends easily or get closer to the ones I sort of
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   knew from high school.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   Neither of these things happened for me at the beginning of college.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   I thought I could make friends all night long, but I was humble.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   My mom told me to spend time with God and just wait for His timing.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   I knew that was the answer, but I was getting impatient.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   I did start to spend more time in prayer and devotions.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   I started not to care about having friends until they just showed up one day during winter
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   quarter of my freshman year.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.320]   When this happened, I realized that I needed to give my life back to God because He is
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.320]   sovereign and His timing was perfect.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.320]   This event strengthened my relationship with Him and made me realize that He needs to be
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   praised and glorified in everything.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   It reminded me to put my complete trust in Him even though it can be hard.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   [applause]
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   Hey, Mallory.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   Do you understand that as you enter into the water, you symbolize your union with Christ
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   in His death?
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   And as you exit the water, you union with Christ in the resurrection.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the name of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   Amen.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   [applause]
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   Hello, church.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   My name is Marsha.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   Let me just start off with, before I came to Christ, I was full of anger, anxiety, and
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   restlessness.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   I didn't respect my mother or family members, and I felt like she only wanted to use me
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   to benefit herself and my older siblings.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   I developed a strong sense of independence and bitterness, so I moved out after my first
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320]   year of college.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   I lived with a frame of mind that if you had enough willpower, you could do anything, be
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   anything.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   And so I exerted my strength to any means that I could grasp to transform my way of
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   living.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.320]   Through sheer determination and to simply to follow the formula, if you do X, you will
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.320]   gain Y.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   Therefore, you will be happy and reap the rewards of a full life.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   But the more I exerted myself, the more I became tired of that lifestyle.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   Because my biological father passed away when I was very young, I never really knew what
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   a loving father or respectful man is like.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   I always lived like I had to fend for myself, and whatever mistakes I made or how I was
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   treated, I had no one else to blame but myself.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   It made me feel like I was less than a person, that I was damaged goods, because I didn't
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   have a father, that I grew up with one that was less than loving, and therefore, I lacked
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.320]   something that everyone else seemed to understand about life.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.320]   I worked hard to go to school and support myself until I started becoming frustrated
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   with my own lack of progress, as I would continue to struggle with depression and a sense of
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   hopelessness.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.320]   I remember coming to work and realizing how much anger I harbored towards everything around
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   me.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.320]   Seeking to find some sort of peace, I decided to go to church again.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   At that time, I considered myself someone who was born a Catholic but became agnostic,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   and in reality, I was just jaded and cynical of those who were religious.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   I came to know Jesus intimately through studying the gospel on my own.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   I was captivated by the stories and testimonies of people who were transformed by the Bible
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   and thought perhaps maybe I could be changed too.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   And through my desperation, I told myself this was my last chance to change my ways.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   There was no other choice but to be sold out for Christ, and to be honest, I wish I had
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   opened up my Bible sooner.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   At the crossroads of anxiety and depression, of fear and sinfulness, of need and shame,
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   of judgment and mercy, of grace and discipline, Jesus met me there.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   And surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time that my mother conceived me, and
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   yet, he sought fit to give me life through his word.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:52.320]   I was so broken by the trial and torture and death Jesus went through just so that I wouldn't
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   have to feel the wrath of hell.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   In my pride, anger, foolishness, and sinfulness, God did not destroy me according to his judgment.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   I had so deeply offended my Creator, but for him to sacrifice his own son for me and withhold
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   nothing less than his pursuit of me, I knew that this was the love I had so longed for.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   I am truly thankful and so in love knowing that he waited for me, he was waiting for
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   me all along, to come and humble myself and repent.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   I came to God seeking a father and found the Creator and lover of his people who sent his
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   son to remind me that I don't need to associate with the pain and pride of my past.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   Growing up without a father or being surrounded by many respectful men in my life was one
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   of God's greatest blessings to me.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   God directed every step and knew every mistake I would make just so that he would reveal
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   his goodness to me.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   I stand before you now knowing that I have a future in Christ and as long as I come to
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   him, I'll never be alone again.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   God makes everything beautiful in its own time and he has taken my time and redeemed
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   it for his good will so that all may come to know him through Jesus Christ.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   And now that I believe in Christ, I am truly able to know the sweetness of following his
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   commands and continue to empty myself and kill the old me that feared and desired the
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   things of this world.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   I found that his laws, terminated and fulfilled by Jesus on the cross, has restored broken
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:26.320]   relationships, heals me from my past and gives me continual hope for the future.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   He is in control of all things and I can rest knowing that God is a good father and Lord.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   I no longer need the wisdom of this world but have the ability to test the truth according
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   to the word that God has given that would stand the test of time.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Where everyone else has failed, including myself, God has promised the sweetest comfort
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.320]   that he would always be with us through pain and joy.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   The very patient and tender love that God has abundantly blessed me with causes my heart
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   to long for him daily.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   It is the patience of God and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, the very death
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   that I so readily deserve for the sinful life I led, that has restored my relationship with
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   him and leads me to turn from my old ways.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   I will move forward and seek to sin no more.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   I will bear my cross for God and for those who are as lost as I was, for I reckon that
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   shall be revealed in us.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   Thank you, Church.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.320]   [applause]
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   [inaudible]
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   [applause]
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   Amen.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   It's such an incredible encouragement to hear from our brothers and sisters their testimony
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:22.320]   of witness, of what they experienced, how they felt when they really saw the love of
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   Christ.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.320]   And I want to just take a moment to address that anybody who is in here, you know, maybe
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   you know about Christianity, you know about maybe what the gospel might entail, but you
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   feel that you don't know that kind of experience with God, it's a great opportunity.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.320]   If any of that really resonated with you, just seek the Lord.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   Simple question for us, you know, is not like how we live the perfect life track, because
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   clearly we have not.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Simple question for us is do we desire to know the Lord?
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   Do we desire to be in his presence?
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   And that's going to forever change us.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   So as an encouragement to, again, anybody in here just joining us this afternoon, please
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   feel free to reach out to any of the pastors and elders, and we'll be more than happy to
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   speak with you about that.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   At the end of service, we do have refreshments and light snacks in the back, so please stick
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   around to both celebrate, congratulate, and to have some time to fellowship.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.120]   This time I'll turn it over to the worship team
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.680]   to lead us in the closing song.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.500]   Thank you.
