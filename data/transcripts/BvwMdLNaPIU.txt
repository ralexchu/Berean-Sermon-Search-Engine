[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:48.020]   - All right, good morning.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.020]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.520]   And I wanna make a quick announcement.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.020]   If you are new to the church, okay,
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.520]   we have a welcome table.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.020]   As you are coming into the parking lot,
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.520]   you may have seen a welcome table as you're coming in.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.020]   So we encourage you to visit that table
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.020]   and you'll be able to meet our welcome crew
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.520]   who will give you information that you need
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.020]   about the church, about Bible studies
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.020]   and various groups that are taking place, activities.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.020]   And so that station's outside.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.520]   If you haven't visited there,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.020]   we encourage you to go by that and just let them know
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.020]   and get the information that you need.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.520]   And also for the college students,
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.020]   because we're starting into the college,
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.520]   people starting to slowly make their way into town.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.520]   And obviously, the last year and a half to two years
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.020]   have been kind of crazy.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.520]   And so we don't know exactly what college life
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   is gonna look like coming into the new year,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.020]   but we know that it's starting to kind of ramp back up.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.520]   So Pastor Nate, our college pastor,
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.020]   asked me to let you guys know
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.020]   there is a college welcome table that is set up.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.520]   It's gonna be set up for the next, I don't know how many,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   maybe a month or two as more and more college students
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.020]   are coming back into town.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.520]   And so if you're new to our church
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.020]   and you're a college student,
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.020]   or maybe you have somebody that you wanna introduce
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.520]   to the college staff, they're gonna be at the table.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.020]   I think it's gonna be in that area,
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.520]   and it'll say, like, it's a college table.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.520]   And so you can visit that table
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.020]   and get the information that you need,
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.520]   'cause they have--our college students
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.020]   have separate activities.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.020]   They have outreaches going on this week with,
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   I think, at Biola, Long Beach, and Chapman,
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.020]   and various places as the schools are starting
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.020]   to get back up and running.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.020]   And so, again, we encourage you to go visit that table
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.520]   and find out the information about what's going on
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   with our college ministry.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.020]   So department.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.520]   That's all the way from nursery to high school seniors.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.020]   If you have children in that--in our education department,
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.020]   there is a meeting for the parents at 2 p.m.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.520]   And so Pastor Peter Chung,
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   who's our education pastor at our church,
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.020]   he's going to be leading us, introducing--
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.520]   introducing the teachers that are coming in
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.520]   and the curriculum, the program, their teaching.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.020]   And so it'll be good for you to know what's happening.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   So we have a ministry philosophy of teaching in our church
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.520]   where we're trying to be consistent
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.020]   with what the adults are learning.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.520]   Our children are also learning at the same time.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.020]   And so we--our education department,
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.020]   we want to make sure that this is not--
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.520]   we're not raising our children.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.020]   We just kind of drop off the kids,
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.020]   and then hopefully that, you know,
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   they'll learn the gospel and grow.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.520]   We're coming alongside the parents.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.020]   As the parents desire what's best for their children spiritually,
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.520]   we want to come alongside and kind of assist.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.520]   And so we need the cooperation of the parents
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.020]   to be there in the educating of our children.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.520]   So we're asking all the parents who have children at 2 p.m.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.020]   So that's just enough time to go grab lunch,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.520]   eat it, and then be back here at 2 o'clock in this room.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   And then from 2 to 3, I think it's going to last about an hour,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   and all the instructions, any questions that you may have
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   of what's going on in our education department,
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.020]   Pastor Peter Chung and the staff
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.020]   will be able to answer those questions for you.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.520]   Okay, along with that, there's a reminder.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   Our home group Bible study, our Wednesday Bible study,
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.020]   is picking back up.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.020]   We had a long break during the summer.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.520]   But starting from this week, whether it is Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.020]   Thursday, Friday, it's picking back up.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.520]   If you signed up for a home group or Bible study,
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.520]   and you have not received any email up to this point,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.020]   please let us know ahead of time.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.520]   Because there are so many new people who are being added,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   if you somehow kind of fell through the crack,
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   or maybe the email that you have, and we spelled it wrong,
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.020]   and you haven't gotten any information,
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.520]   please contact us as soon as possible,
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.020]   and we'll make sure that we have the correct email address
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.020]   and get you into the right place.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.520]   And so you should have been contacted
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.020]   by your home group leaders,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.520]   and I'm not sure about the small group leaders,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   but if you're coming on Wednesday,
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.020]   Wednesday it's going to be here in this room.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.020]   So all that is picking back up this week.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.520]   And so just to kind of give you a heads up.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.020]   One last announcement.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.520]   BBA, Beroean Basketball Association,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.520]   as you guys know, we have the brothers get together
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.020]   and play basketball on--
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.520]   we haven't been able to have it in a while
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.020]   because of what's been going on,
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.520]   but they are having it,
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.520]   and it's going to be outside at the Great Park,
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   starting from October 3rd,
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.020]   and then all the way through November.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.520]   And so it's starting at 530 to 630.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.520]   It's going to be outside, and this is--
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   if you are a member or you are in the process
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.020]   of becoming a member, you're welcome to join.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.020]   So there is a table. As you're going into the cafe,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   there's a table out there for you to sign up.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   So even if--whatever basketball level that you're at,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   they have a place for you, right?
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.020]   They're going to hook you up with teams
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   that have better players, so don't worry about that.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.020]   Our primary purpose of this is for fellowship.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.520]   A few people get out of hand and they want to compete,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   but primarily it's for fellowship.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.020]   So even if your skill level may not be up to par,
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.020]   just come out. And even if you're not playing,
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.020]   we encourage you to come out and spend time together
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.520]   and get to know other guys.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   WBBA, Women's Basketball Association,
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.520]   I think they're also trying to put it together,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.020]   but they need to know if there's enough people to do that.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.520]   Okay? So I don't know who the point person is,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   but I'm assuming it's Ashley Hamamoto.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   I'm assuming that is her, so go bother her
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   if you are interested in playing.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.520]   And so they're trying to gather some people to do that.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.020]   And if they do that, they say they're going to be
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.520]   probably playing at the same place, at the park.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.020]   So please let them know.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.020]   And again, the sign-up table is over there at the cafe.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.020]   Before I pray for the offering,
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   I want to encourage our church to take some time to pray
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.020]   for what's going on in Afghanistan.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   If you looked at our Facebook page,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.020]   I posted up a letter that Pastor Nate got
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.520]   from one of his missionary contacts that he has in Afghanistan.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.020]   And so, again, if you haven't read it,
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.020]   I encourage you to go read it.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.520]   We did get information that that particular family
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.020]   was able to get out,
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.520]   but the staff that they're working with are still stuck there.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   And so they're not sure if they are going to be able to come out.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   The deadline, our government has set a hard line
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   saying that that is going to be the end.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.020]   And what's going on in Afghanistan is much worse.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.020]   At least that's what we're hearing from the Christians.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.020]   And so whatever it is that they're saying on the news
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.520]   and from the government,
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.020]   it's exponentially worse for Christians.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.020]   Well, I've actually heard that the Taliban
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.520]   is going through people's phones.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   And if you have any foreign contact,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   that's enough for them to target you
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.520]   and possibly execute you on the street.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.520]   And that's how bad it is.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.520]   So the Christians are living in fear,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.020]   and so the deadline has been set.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.520]   So if they are not able to get out within the next few days,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.520]   there's going to be serious consequences.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.520]   So that kind of stuff is not being reported accurately on the media.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.020]   So please continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.020]   Some of you may know or may not know
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:55.020]   that Afghanistan actually was the second fastest-growing Christian community in the world.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.020]   Number one is Iran.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.020]   Two of the most hostile places in the world
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   where Christianity has been flourishing.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.020]   And so I remember when 9/11 happened,
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.020]   I had a few friends who were actually missionaries there,
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.020]   and they had to be escorted out because the war broke out.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   And when they were doing missions under the Taliban,
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.020]   I remember getting pictures with my friend
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   who was just completely covered and only their eyes,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.020]   and they had to be in security.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   And we didn't actually even know where they were for security reasons
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.020]   until after they came out and they told us.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.020]   After the war broke out, the military and various things happened,
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   and it opened up, so the missionaries just took that opportunity and went in there.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.520]   And they've been very fruitful for the last 20 years.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.020]   And so it's been growing fast.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.020]   So there's a large group of Muslims who turned to Christ because of their work.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   And so now that the military, the U.S. military is pulling out,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   it's putting all of them in danger.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.020]   And so a lot of the Western missionaries are able to come out,
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.520]   but the problem is all those people who got converted out in Afghanistan
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   will not be able to come out.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.020]   And so whatever the deadline is,
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.520]   they are not able to come out because they do not have U.S. passports.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.020]   And even those who do have U.S. passports are having a hard time
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.520]   even getting to the place where they need to go and get out.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.020]   So the situation there is pretty dire.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.520]   If you guys can please continue to keep them in your prayer.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520]   I'm going to pray for our offering.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.020]   And as I pray for the offering, I want to give you guys an extra time
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:30.520]   to take some time to pray, but also ultimately to go beyond this time
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.020]   and in your homes, in private, to really focus your energy
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.020]   in praying for our brothers and sisters who are there,
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.020]   those missionaries who need to come out
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.520]   and for the brothers and sisters who are there
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.020]   who will continue to work after they leave,
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.520]   that the Lord would continue to guide them and lead them,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.020]   give them courage to persevere in what's happening over there.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.520]   So let me pray for our offering.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.020]   I'll give you time to give the offering,
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.020]   but again, join us in a time of prayer
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.520]   as we lift up our brothers and sisters in Afghanistan.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   Gracious Father, that we know that even in this,
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   you are completely sovereign.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   Lord, we pray for our leaders, Lord God,
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.020]   that you would give them wisdom.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:17.020]   Give them courage, Lord, not to fear opinions of man,
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.520]   not to allow their desire to stay in power,
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.020]   to make wrong decisions.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:30.520]   I pray, Father God, that the fear of who you are
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.020]   would cause them, Lord God, no matter what the consequence,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.520]   to make the decisions that are right in your eyes.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.020]   I pray for our government, Lord God,
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.520]   and I know how unhealthy and how divided it's been
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.520]   for so many years.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.020]   Help them, Lord God, to see with compassion
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.020]   all that is unfolding, Lord God,
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.020]   and what's happening in particular in Afghanistan right now,
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.520]   especially the next few days,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.020]   as so many people, Lord, are trying to find their way.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.520]   Families with small children, missionaries, Christians,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   Lord God, who are in need to come out,
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.020]   I pray, Father God, that you would guide their path
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   and that we may hear good news of that.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.020]   We pray for our brothers and sisters
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.020]   who came to faith, Lord God, from their Muslim faith,
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.020]   who are actively being sought out by the Taliban.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.520]   I pray that you would give them courage and strength,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.020]   that your grace would be sufficient for them.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.520]   Protect them and guide them.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   Cause them to bear even more fruit, Lord God,
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.020]   in the midst of intense persecution.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   Help us as a church, Lord, not to be hardened in our heart
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   because we are so far removed.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.520]   Help us to join them in fellowship, in much prayer,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   that we would intercede for them.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.020]   And we pray, Father God, that with all our brothers and sisters
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.520]   who are suffering around the world,
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.020]   that in the end it would lead to greater glory to your name,
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   that the world would know, Father God,
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.520]   that our hope is not in this life,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.020]   that safety and comfort and wealth is not what we pursue.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.020]   I pray that your name may be honored and glorified, Lord,
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.020]   even through all of this.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.020]   Help us, Lord God, even in our giving,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.020]   that we would give intentionally, purposefully, joyfully.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.020]   May it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold, Lord God,
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.020]   that the gospel may continue to spread
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.020]   and more and more people who are lost
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.520]   may come to the faith of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   So we lift this time to you, we lift this offering to you.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.020]   Only our Holy God.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:56.020]   God of beauty demands such praises.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:02.020]   God of splendor enshines the sun.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:08.020]   God of majesty rules with justice.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:13.020]   Only our Holy God.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:26.020]   Heaven belongs to the one and the only.

[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.020]   Our Holy God.

[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:08.020]   What other name remains undefiled?
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.020]   Only our Holy God.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:25.020]   Heaven belongs to the one and the only.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:31.020]   Heaven sings holy forever.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   Our Holy God.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.020]   Come and worship the Holy God.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:44.020]   God of beholders.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:49.020]   Our one and the only.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:55.020]   God sings holy forever.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.020]   Our Holy God.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:03.020]   Come and worship the Holy God.

[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:45.020]   Who else invites me to call Him Father?
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:50.020]   Only our Holy God.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:56.020]   Only my Holy God.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:07.020]   Heaven belongs to the one and the only.

[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   God of beholders.

[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:38.020]   God sings holy forever.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   Our Holy God.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.020]   Come and worship the Holy God.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:50.020]   Come and worship the Holy God.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:38:01.020]   [Music]
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.020]   You may be seated.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:13.020]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:19.020]   We're going to be jumping back into the text in verse 25 through 29.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.020]   Hebrews chapter 12 verses 25 through 29.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:31.020]   I didn't get far in the first service, so I'm assuming I won't get far in the second service either.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.020]   Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25 through 29.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.020]   Reading out of the NSV.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:43.020]   See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:51.020]   For if those who did not escape when they refused Him who warned them on earth,
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:56.020]   much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:04.020]   And His voice shook the earth then, but now He is promising yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:09.020]   This expression yet once more denotes the removing of the things which can be shaken
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.020]   as of created things so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.020]   Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken,
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:25.020]   let us show gratitude by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.020]   For our God is a consuming fire.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.020]   Let's pray.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   Heavenly Father,
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.020]   I pray that you would protect this pulpit.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:49.020]   Whether I stand here or anyone else, may it be your words and your words only.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:55.020]   Protect us, Lord God, from man's opinions and thoughts.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:00.020]   That we may hear your voice and only your voice.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.020]   That we would not refuse you.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:11.020]   May the authority that you've given to the church, that you've placed in your word by the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:18.020]   be known, Lord God, to everyone who has drawn near to this room to hear from you.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:24.020]   Anoint this time, Father God, that your grace would be enough.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:39.020]   One of the most powerful words that we have in English is the word grace.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   Grace is the reason why you and I are here. We're saved by the grace of God.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.020]   We endure because of this grace.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:56.020]   Grace is what gives hope to the hopeless.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:04.020]   When there seems to be no human answer of what's going on in our life, what's going on in the world,
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.020]   and yet grace gives us hope.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:14.020]   It gives hope and refuge to those who are helpless and oppressed.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:22.020]   What's going on in Afghanistan, where brothers and sisters are suffering, from human eyes, it is terrifying.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.020]   From human perspective, there is no hope.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:34.020]   When Apostle Paul, in his suffering, begged Christ to remove the thorn on his side,
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:39.020]   Jesus' answer to him was, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.020]   It is sufficient for Paul, it is sufficient for us,
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:49.020]   and our brothers and sisters who are in Afghanistan, who is praying to God,
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:55.020]   the ultimate answer is, however this turns out, that his grace is sufficient.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.020]   It is a powerful word.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:02.020]   We sing about his grace, we memorize scriptures about his grace.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.020]   It gives us comfort, it gives us hope, it gives us reasons to sing.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:19.020]   But when grace is misunderstood, and it is misapplied, or it is cheapened, it has dire consequences.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:27.020]   We make grace a free ticket to enter into heaven,
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.020]   that we can continue to live in darkness and sin,
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:36.020]   and we declare the grace of God to be covered.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.020]   It's kind of like when we were children,
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.020]   we play games and we will lie to our siblings or to our friends,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:48.020]   and we cross our fingers behind our back, and we can tell all kinds of lies.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   And when we lied, it's like, "No, I'm okay, because I crossed my finger."
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:59.020]   When grace is misapplied, and it is cheap, it perverts righteousness.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:05.020]   It gives us a reason to live in sin, in selfishness, in rebellion against God,
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.020]   and declare that it is because of grace I'm safe.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:15.020]   Grace can be easily perverted if we're not careful,
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:21.020]   not realizing what we believe and practice is cheap grace.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:30.020]   D.J. Kvonhofer writes in his book, Discipleship, about this cheap grace, and this is what he says,
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:37.020]   "Cheap grace is a deadly enemy of our church. We are fighting today for costly grace.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.020]   Cheap grace means grace sold on the market like a cheap jack's ware."
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.020]   In other words, he just passes it out like it's not worth much.
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:52.020]   "The sacraments, the forgiveness of sin, the consolations of religion are thrown away at cut prices.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.020]   Grace is represented at the church's inexhaustible treasury,
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:01.020]   from which she showers blessing with generous hands without asking questions or fixing limits.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.020]   Grace without price. Grace without cost.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:08.020]   The essence of grace, we suppose, is that the account has been paid in advance,
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   and because it has been paid, everything can be had for nothing."
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   That's the definition of cheap grace.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.020]   I remember years ago, I was out in Kenya,
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   visiting an orphan work that our church members were involved in,
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:32.020]   and I found something very surprising about the economy over there.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.020]   Because they've had poor government, and they have so many resources over there,
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.020]   clearly it's been poor for many, many generations.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:47.020]   Because of civil war, famine, AIDS epidemic,
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.020]   the economy has been crushed for many generations,
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   and what I noticed was there were a lot of Christian signs everywhere,
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.020]   and I realized that their economy was being propped up by outside help.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:03.020]   So everywhere you go, you'll see buses, cars, buildings,
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   that have been dedicated in the name of Christ.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.020]   Some Baptist something, some Presbyterian something, some Pentecostal something,
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.020]   but you'll see those crosses and signs everywhere.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:18.020]   And I realized that they've been getting a lot of aid for many, many generations,
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.020]   and where this was most evident was,
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.020]   those of you guys who know, who's ever traveled with me,
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   I usually travel with some beef jerky,
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   and the reason why is I'm not very adventurous with food.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.020]   I usually, like if I like something and I go to that restaurant,
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.020]   I order the same thing 100% of the time.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.020]   Right?
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.020]   Until somebody, it looks good and I'll taste it the next time I order that,
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.020]   but I'm not adventurous with food.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.020]   So it was no different.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   I was in Kenya and I took a couple bags of beef jerky and I was eating it,
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.020]   and one of the pastors saw it and I offered it to him.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.020]   He ate it and he loved it.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:54.020]   And then the next thing that came out of his mouth was,
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.020]   "Do you have any more?"
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.020]   So of course, I'll give him some more.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.020]   He ate that and he ate it up.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.020]   And then the next thing that he said to me surprised me,
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.020]   and he said, "Give me the bag."
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.020]   Just like that.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   "Give me the bag."
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.020]   So I was like, "Maybe his English isn't good."
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   You know, that's pretty rude the way he asked for it.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   So I said, "Okay, I'm here trying to help them.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.020]   He's doing work with orphans."
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.020]   So, you know, I gave him the bag and then he ate it and said,
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.020]   "Do you have any more? You didn't even finish that."
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.020]   And of course, I brought some more because I was there for a while.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.020]   So he asked me, "Do you have some?"
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.020]   I said, "Give it to me."
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.020]   Just like that.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.020]   He said, "Give it to me."
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   So I said, "What is going on here?
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.020]   Did I do something to offend this guy?"
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.020]   So I ended up giving him the beef jerky,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.020]   and I was just kind of like perplexed the way he asked for it.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.020]   And then the next thing that came out of his mouth is because he said,
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.020]   "You are rich,
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:48.020]   and we are poor.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:52.020]   And you have plenty at home and I do not.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.020]   So give it to me."
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.020]   So I realized that from that encounter is that there,
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   at least that pastor was so used to getting things from the outsiders.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.020]   It was just a matter of fact.
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.020]   "Give it to me."
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.020]   There was no thank you, no appreciation.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.020]   You're supposed to.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.020]   You're a Christian. I'm a Christian.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   God gave you plenty.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.020]   I don't have enough.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.020]   So give it to me.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:18.020]   I remember experiencing that also when I was doing homeless ministry.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.020]   And I would go out and, you know, we would feed every week on Tuesday.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.020]   And then we gathered all these extra clothing because it was wintertime.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:30.020]   And then we would set up and we would always have a hard time keeping in line
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.020]   because they would rush to the front and just grab whatever they want.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:37.020]   And so those people who weren't at the front and didn't get the clothes that they wanted,
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.020]   and it would start out with thank you,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.020]   but it would always end with somebody cussing me out
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.020]   because I didn't bring enough or the sizes don't fit
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.020]   or it wasn't exactly what they wanted.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:52.020]   And I would always leave after giving that to them,
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.020]   saying like, "What is this?"
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   And so for a period I was like, "Man, they're not worth this."
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   You know, I'm sacrificing to do all of this and I get cussed out.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   And again, it's not everybody that did that,
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   but there would always be somebody who don't realize what it is
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.020]   and then they would just leave.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.020]   As extreme as those examples may sound,
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.020]   that's what cheap grace looks like.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.020]   When we come into church and we demand grace from each other,
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.020]   you're Christians, you're a church,
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.020]   why are you acting that way?
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.020]   Shouldn't you be more gracious?
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.020]   You cannot by definition demand grace.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:35.020]   Grace is asking for something that you don't deserve,
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.020]   so how can you demand grace?
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:43.020]   If you demand grace, you don't understand what grace is.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.020]   That is cheap grace that we're expecting.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.020]   We don't expect grace.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.020]   We should expect justice.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.020]   I mean, if we're, to be honest,
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:58.020]   what we really expect is vengeance if you wrong somebody.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.020]   But if we are somewhat righteous and have some conscience
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.020]   that we would only seek justice.
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.020]   But to demand grace,
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:10.020]   to demand grace,
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.020]   to come into church and say, "Why didn't God answer my prayer?"
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.020]   Why do you think that God has to answer your prayers?
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.020]   Where was God?
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:26.020]   Why do you automatically think that God is supposed to answer your prayers?
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.020]   What is it about grace that you think,
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.020]   and you have a knee-jerk reaction,
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.020]   a default setting,
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.020]   of God needs to run when I call?
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   All of that is because cheap grace has deeply penetrated our psyche,
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.020]   especially because of where you and I live.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:49.020]   The love of God has been passed out like free candy on Halloween.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.020]   And so we've been trained to believe,
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.020]   even though we were never expressive,
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   we've been trained to believe and feel
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.020]   that God needs to come when I call.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.020]   That is cheap grace.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   You know, even the word charisma,
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.020]   the English word charisma,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.020]   when we say somebody has charisma,
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.020]   we automatically think this is somebody who's gregarious,
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.020]   who's good with people, who's not awkward,
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.020]   somebody who's able to keep a crowd and make people feel good.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   The very definition of the word charisma,
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.020]   in its word, has the word grace,
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.020]   the Greek word charis.
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.020]   So if you look at the etymology of this word,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.020]   it basically comes from Middle English,
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.020]   and it basically means the one who has been favored,
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:41.020]   where God has been gracious to him.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.020]   That's the definition of the word charisma.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   But the way you and I use it is,
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.020]   he has charisma.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:51.020]   The actual word means he's been given grace.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.020]   That's what that word means.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:57.020]   And just as we have perverted that word
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.020]   to think that somebody innately has charisma,
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:05.020]   cheap grace doesn't recognize
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.020]   who it is that we are dealing with.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.020]   We must not make the mistake that God's grace means
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.020]   that we are free to do whatever we want.
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   Cross our fingers, right?
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.020]   We raised our hand, we got baptized,
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.020]   so I feel bad when I sin,
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.020]   but once saved, always saved.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:32.020]   Grace must not be perverted.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:39.020]   It is the kindness of God that leads us to what?
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.020]   Repentance.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.020]   Those of you who were at the retreat,
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:47.020]   Dr. Street did a great job of what is true repentance.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   True repentance isn't simply feeling sorry.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.020]   I felt bad that I did that.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.020]   True repentance is a turn from our sins,
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.020]   to put away our old life,
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:03.020]   that we may reconcile and restore what ought to be.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.020]   That's true repentance.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.020]   So it's the kindness, it's not the grace of God
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.020]   that simply covers you,
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.020]   so that the penalty of sin no longer belongs to you,
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:13.020]   but true repentance is to turn away from that,
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.020]   and to turn to God.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.020]   And it is the kindness of God,
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:23.020]   it is the grace of God that leads us to true repentance.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:28.020]   It is cheap grace to think that because we raised our hand,
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.020]   because we went into the water,
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:33.020]   we are covered so now we can live the rest of our life
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   any way we desire.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   That is cheap grace, and it is not biblical grace.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.020]   God's grace provides us the ability to choose life over death,
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:47.020]   to choose obedience over disobedience.
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.020]   That's grace.
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.020]   It's not you and I, by our own will, by our own effort,
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:58.020]   that we somehow are choosing to do what we think is right to do.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.020]   He said it's the grace of God,
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.020]   true grace of God that causes us to turn from our sins
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.020]   and to live a new life in Christ.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:11.020]   The whole book of Titus is to deal with this idea of cheap grace.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.020]   People are professing with their mouth that they believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.020]   but by their life they deny Him.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.020]   That's what it says in Titus 1:16.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.020]   They profess to know God.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:26.020]   They profess to have God's grace.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:29.020]   They profess with their mouth they know God,
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:33.020]   but by their deeds they deny Him.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.020]   Your works speak louder than your words.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.020]   That's what he's saying.
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.020]   Your life is more evident of what you believe than what you profess,
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.020]   being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deeds,
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.020]   because it's just a profession.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.020]   It's not real.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.020]   It's cheap grace.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:57.020]   Titus 2, 11-14, "For the grace of God has appeared."
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.020]   Grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:04.020]   instructing us to deny ungodliness, worldly desire,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   and to live sensibly, righteously, and godly in the present age.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.020]   What challenges them?
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.020]   What causes them?
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.020]   What tells them?
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.020]   What rebukes them?
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.020]   What corrects them?
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:20.020]   It's the grace of God, it says.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.020]   The grace of God has appeared, instructing and telling,
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.020]   looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:33.020]   and Savior, Christ Jesus, who gave himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.020]   The grace of God did that.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:40.020]   And to purify himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.020]   The grace of God did that.
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:47.020]   We have a tendency to think that if we start to preach strong sermons,
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:53.020]   and people feel guilty and rebuked, that's not grace.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.020]   We need to talk more about grace.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:00.020]   Grace means that despite your sins, that God covered us,
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:05.020]   and we can leave encouraged and continue to live the way we desire to live.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.020]   That's grace.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   You continue to preach grace because our life is hard enough as it is.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:15.020]   But when we are confronted over our sins and rebuked and challenged to live righteous lives,
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.020]   that is not grace.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:23.020]   That is legalism, harshness, guilt, law.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.020]   But yet he says the grace of God,
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:32.020]   the grace of God teaches us to live and follow Christ righteously.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:37.020]   It is because chief grace has so deeply embedded into our psyche,
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:43.020]   because the word of God and the grace of God in the gospel has been peddled
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.020]   so that we can get the gospel to the lowest common denominator,
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.020]   and an individual who has never truly surrendered their life to Christ
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.020]   can also be accepted into the kingdom of God.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.020]   So all you have to do is give Jesus a chance.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:59.020]   The way that the gospel is being propagated in our generation
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:03.020]   is that God is the one who offended us,
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.020]   and the church is apologizing to the world.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.020]   Give us a chance. Come to church. Accept Jesus.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.020]   And whatever it is that you've been offended by,
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.020]   we'll try to minimize that as much as possible.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:18.020]   And so people are walking through the door
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:23.020]   with cheap grace in their mind from day one.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.020]   Sinners are coming into the church with a consumer mindset.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.020]   So do I want to be at this church?
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:32.020]   If you want to keep me at this church, I want this.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.020]   So the sinners are the ones who have been offended,
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:38.020]   and the holy God is the one who has offended,
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:42.020]   and the church is begging an opportunity for the sinners
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.020]   to give Jesus a chance.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.020]   Imagine how offensive that is.
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:55.020]   If somebody offended you, and you sent an ambassador on your behalf,
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:57:01.020]   and they were begging for them to give you a chance.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:07.020]   If you were the one offended, see, that's cheap grace.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.020]   That's cheap grace.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:15.020]   The way that the gospel is preached
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:19.020]   has to represent the holy God that's been offended.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.020]   He's the one we need to reconcile with.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.020]   He's the one we need to appease.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.020]   He's the one we worship.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.020]   So when we come to church, our primary thought should not be,
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:33.020]   "What am I getting out of this?"
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:38.020]   It's, "How can I have a relationship with this holy God?"
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:42.020]   It is because the gospel has been propagated cheaply.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:47.020]   It's been handed out as free candy to anyone who wants it.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:54.020]   All because men who are afraid of human opinion,
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:59.020]   men who have become convinced that a successful church is the largest church,
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:07.020]   men who have been convinced that if you have many people who honor you,
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:10.020]   that you must be doing something right,
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.020]   men who should not be speaking,
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.020]   men who should not have been ordained,
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:23.020]   men who should not have ever been speaking on behalf of an offended holy God,
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:28.020]   all because of cheap grace.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:33.020]   There's three things that I wanted to give you an outline of the text that we're looking at,
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.020]   but like I told you, I didn't get through the first one.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.020]   So we'll get to the others.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.020]   We're in no hurry.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:42.020]   At least I'm not.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.020]   Three things.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.020]   Proper response to the grace of God.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:50.020]   God's grace demands that we pay close attention to what God has to say.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.020]   Proper response.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.020]   Take what he says seriously.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:59.020]   Two, God's grace reminds us to live for what cannot be shaken.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:06.020]   How much of what we pursue when Christ comes will mean nothing.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:10.020]   Three, God's grace calls us to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:13.020]   Those are the three things that we see in this text.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.020]   How to respond properly.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:20.020]   First one, God's grace demands that we pay close attention to what God says.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:26.020]   Verse 25, "See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking."
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:33.020]   Remember, the previous text, just to remind you, just four weeks ago we were talking about this.
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.020]   He was differentiating between coming to Mount Sinai and Mount Zion.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:41.020]   Mount Sinai represented terror.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.020]   Where the people of Israel was begging Moses,
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.020]   "Tell God to stop speaking to us," because they were so terrified.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.020]   Even a glimpse of his glory terrified them and asked Moses to go inside the tent,
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.020]   because they couldn't look at him.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:57.020]   But he says, "You did not come to Mount Sinai. You came to Mount Zion."
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.020]   A place of joy, of worship, where the angels and all the multitudes
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:05.020]   will be gathered together to worship him, to experience his true life.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:10.020]   So after explaining this grace, after reminding them,
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:16.020]   "You didn't come to Mount Sinai. You came to Zion, a place of celebration and banquet."
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   But in conclusion to that, you would think, you say, "Well, because God is gracious.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.020]   Because God is gracious."
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.020]   We would typically think, if you only understood cheap grace,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.020]   "Because God is gracious, I can do whatever I want. My salvation is secure."
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:40.020]   "Because God is gracious, no matter how much I sin, God will never forsake me."
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.020]   "Because God is gracious."
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.020]   And so that's what naturally we would think.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.020]   But he says, "Because God has been gracious," he says,
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.020]   "Do not refuse him who speaks."
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.020]   "Because God is gracious."
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.020]   Pay close attention to what he has to say.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:03.020]   That was the practical application of telling us about his grace.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:06.020]   Take what he says seriously.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.020]   Now you have to understand, when he says, "Do not refuse him,"
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.020]   what does it mean to refuse him?
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.020]   And according to the context of the book of Hebrews,
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:19.020]   the whole time he's been telling them to do what?
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.020]   Not to neglect.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.020]   Neglect.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:28.020]   What do you have to do to not to neglect?
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:32.020]   Because clearly that's what he means here by, "Do not refuse him."
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.020]   What does he mean by not to neglect?
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.020]   What do you have to do not to neglect?
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.020]   Absolutely nothing.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.020]   How will you escape if you neglect such a great salvation?
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.020]   We're warned over and over again, "Do not drift."
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:53.020]   What do you have to do to drift?
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:58.020]   How hard do you have to work to drift?
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.020]   Nothing.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:05.020]   So when he says here, "Do not refuse him,"
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.020]   refusing him requires no effort on our part.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:14.020]   Continue to do what comes natural to you.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.020]   Continue to live you as the center of your life.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.020]   Continue. Just continue.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.020]   You need to do nothing.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.020]   After you hear the warning from God,
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:27.020]   if you want to refuse him, do nothing.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:30.020]   After the warning that has been given to you,
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:33.020]   if you want to refuse him, do nothing.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.020]   There's nothing to do.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.020]   Just go outside, live your life the way you've always been living,
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.020]   and just continue to pursue,
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.020]   and just make sure that you're back here on Sunday.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:45.020]   That's all you need to do to refuse him.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:49.020]   When God speaks, He doesn't come and speak and say,
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.020]   "You know what? I just want to tell you I love you,"
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.020]   and then He disappears.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.020]   There's a reason why God speaks.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.020]   When God interjects into human history to speak directly to His prophets,
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:10.020]   to speak to His children, it's because there is danger.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.020]   He comes to instruct them, gives them warnings so that we can change.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:18.020]   He speaks in order that sinful men and women would repent.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.020]   He's not speaking empty words.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:24.020]   That's exactly what He says in Deuteronomy 32, 45 to 47.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:28.020]   When He spoke to the nation of Israel and gave them all the instructions of His law,
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.020]   He summarizes in saying this,
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   "When Moses had finished speaking all these words to Israel,
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:38.020]   He says to them, 'Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today.'"
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:43.020]   Remember at the retreat, Dr. Shreve said the heart is not just talking about emotion,
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.020]   but it's our very being.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:51.020]   So when He says, "Take to heart," He's talking about deep in your soul,
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.020]   not just how you feel.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.020]   When you've heard the Word of God,
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.020]   "Take to heart all the words with which I am warning you today,
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.020]   which you shall command your sons to observe carefully."
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.020]   Command.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.020]   And when He says sons, He's not just talking about children.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.020]   He's talking about the nation of Israel.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:10.020]   Don't suggest it to them.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:13.020]   Don't suggest it to them and say, "Hey, I'm going to give you some good advice."
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.020]   He says, "Command them."
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.020]   How can He command? Who is Moses to command them?
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.020]   Moses is just another man like anybody else.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.020]   He is fraught with weakness like anybody else.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.020]   He is fearful like anybody else.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.020]   How can Moses command them?
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:35.020]   He tells them to command them because He speaks on behalf of God who tells Him to.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.020]   Command them.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.020]   Why does He give this command?
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.020]   "Command your sons to observe carefully, even all the words of the law,
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.020]   for it is not an idle word for you."
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.020]   It's not something for you to hear and then make your decision,
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.020]   "Ah, let me think about it.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.020]   Maybe I'll do it later. Maybe at the right time."
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.020]   It is not idle words for you.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:56.020]   Indeed, it is your life, life and death.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:00.020]   When God speaks and He says, "Move," and you don't move,
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:03.020]   there's deathly consequence.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:09.020]   When God says to do this and you say, "Ah, maybe not now."
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:12.020]   "And by this word you will prolong your days in the land
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.020]   which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess."
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.020]   Hebrews 12, 25b, which we just read.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.020]   Why do we need to pay close attention?
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:25.020]   "For if those did not escape when they refused Him,
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.020]   who warned them on earth, much less will we escape
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:33.020]   who turn away from Him who warns from heaven."
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   Think about what Mount Sinai was.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:40.020]   Mount Sinai was not the demonstration of His full glory.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:45.020]   Mount Sinai was a glimpse of His glory.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.020]   That glimpse of His glory that He touched down on earth
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.020]   at Mount Sinai was so terrifying that sinners
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.020]   not only did not want to look at Him,
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.020]   they didn't want to hear from Him.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:01.020]   His very words were terrifying and they begged Him,
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.020]   "Please tell them to stop speaking."
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.020]   Because they were so terrified.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.020]   Didn't He say we didn't go to Mount Sinai?
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.020]   Didn't He say we're Zion now?
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.020]   I thought we weren't supposed to be terrified
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.020]   because we've been covered by the blood of Christ.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:23.020]   So who is He speaking to?
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:30.020]   He's speaking to people who have embraced cheap grace.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.020]   And they may be in danger of feeling falsely secure
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.020]   because of this cheap grace.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.020]   And because of this cheap grace, they think they can approach
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.020]   the throne of God.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.020]   They couldn't approach Sinai from a distance.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.020]   But a sinner who's not been washed by the blood of Christ,
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.020]   who doesn't understand true grace,
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:54.020]   walking into His presence with confidence in false grace.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.020]   How much more would it be terrifying if God who spoke
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.020]   at Sinai caused this kind of fear?
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:07.020]   How much more a professing Christian who has been deceived
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:11.020]   when he meets the Holy God from heaven.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.020]   That's what He's referring to.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:17.020]   People who have been deceived by cheap grace.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:22.020]   Hebrews 2, 1-3, it says, "For this reason, we must pay
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:25.020]   much closer attention to what we have heard
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:29.020]   so that we do not drift away from it.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.020]   If the word spoken through angels proved unalterable
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.020]   and every transgression and disobedience received
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.020]   a just penalty, how will we escape if we neglect
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.020]   so great a salvation?"
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:44.020]   You hear it and you just pick and choose what you want.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.020]   You know, I love the fact that Jesus loves me unconditionally.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.020]   I love the fact that my sins have been covered.
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.020]   I love the fact that we have eternity in Christ
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.020]   and we're going to have eternity with Him.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.020]   Pick up your cross, deny yourself.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:59.020]   You want to live?
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.020]   To forsake your life to follow Christ?
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.020]   That's for the pastors, the missionaries,
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.020]   the serious Christians, the gung-ho, the Jesus freaks.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:12.020]   But for regular Christians, I choose cheap grace.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.020]   Cheap grace isn't grace at all.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.020]   In fact, it isn't even salvation.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.020]   It is the greatest deception.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:24.020]   It is the greatest tool that Satan uses
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:28.020]   to deceive thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.020]   and millions of people in the church
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:38.020]   to continue to walk as themselves at the center,
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   pursuing their life, their comfort,
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.020]   their luxury in the name of Jesus.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:51.020]   But their life has never been surrendered to Christ.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.020]   And it's hard to distinguish
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:09:00.020]   because people who embrace cheap grace are in the church.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.020]   They serve the church.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.020]   Sometimes they lead Bible studies.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   They know a lot about Scripture.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.020]   They know how to play this game.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:16.020]   But you and I know, you and I know,
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:20.020]   if we have been surrendered or not,
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.020]   if we're pursuing our own life in the name of Jesus
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.020]   or we've actually surrendered our life.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.020]   We get baptized.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.020]   Part of the reason why we don't sprinkle
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:35.020]   is because the meaning of baptism is burial.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.020]   That's what it says in the Book of Romans.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.020]   We are buried with Christ.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020]   That's why when somebody gets baptized, we ask them,
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:45.020]   "Do you understand that you're being buried with Christ?"
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.020]   And that's why when somebody gets baptized,
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.020]   if they don't put their whole body in,
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:53.020]   I shove it in further.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.020]   Some people go in and they don't want to get their hair wet.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:00.020]   No, your hair needs to die too.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.020]   So we shove them in.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:05.020]   Some people have nice makeup on.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.020]   They go right up to here.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.020]   And then I said, "No, you got to go all the way in."
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   We can't bury you with your face sticking up.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:21.020]   But the idea of burial is to die with Christ.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.020]   As He was buried, we are to be buried.
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.020]   That's what baptism is.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.020]   We are united with His death.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.020]   Not just sacrifice, not hard life, with His death.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:38.020]   So whatever life that we were holding on to prior to is gone.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.020]   That's how the Bible describes it.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.020]   Behold, the old has gone.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.020]   The new has come.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.020]   So that's why we ask, "Do you understand you're going into the water
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.020]   buried with Christ?"
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:54.020]   And when you come out, you're united with Christ's resurrected life.
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:11:04.020]   People practice cheap grace have united with Him in certain parts.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.020]   I'll give you this, I'll give you that.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.020]   I'll go in, but just not here.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.020]   Okay, okay, I'll be serious.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:13.020]   Right up to here.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.020]   But they're not dead.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:21.020]   Our life doesn't look much different than the rest of the world.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.020]   We pursue the same things that the world pursues.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.020]   We just go to church on Sunday.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.020]   We're worried about the same thing that they're worried about.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.020]   We're just active on Sunday.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.020]   We're just as concerned, just as worried, just as fearful as the rest of the
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:45.020]   world, except I'm active at church on Sunday or weekday.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:52.020]   True grace causes us to recognize that He saved us from this.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:59.020]   The very things that you and I are pursuing is what caused this death.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:06.020]   The reason why there's marriage problems is because we're not dead yet.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.020]   There's relational issues because we're not dead yet.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   Dead people don't argue.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.020]   Dead people don't have fights.
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.020]   Dead people don't divide.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:25.020]   So our challenge in sanctification is to die, not to become better.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   No, to die.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:33.020]   You can't think about becoming better until you're dead, until the old has gone.
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:38.020]   But if you've never got rid of the old and you're trying to build on top of
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:43.020]   something that haven't died, that's why the frustration is coming,
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.020]   because the ground keeps shifting.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:53.020]   Hebrews 10, 26-31, it says, "If we go on sinning willfully after receiving the
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:58.020]   knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins."
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.020]   This is talking to the church.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:04.020]   "But a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.020]   consume the adversaries.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.020]   Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.020]   two or three witnesses.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.020]   How much severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:18.020]   the Son of God, has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.020]   has been sanctified?"
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.020]   He was sanctified.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.020]   "And insulted the Spirit of grace, for we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.020]   I will repay.'"
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.020]   And again, the Lord will judge his people.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:34.020]   "It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.020]   He says, "Once you've received the knowledge and you continue to willfully
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.020]   sin, the judgment is much greater."
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.020]   I said, "Wait a second.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.020]   I thought we're saved by grace."
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:50.020]   He's talking to people who never really received true grace, cheap grace.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.020]   In fact, all the knowledge you get causes you to have greater judgment.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:59.020]   Sitting in a church that reveals the Word of God to you week after week after week,
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:04.020]   and then there continue to live after your own desires, you're keeping up
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.020]   greater judgment for yourself.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   Let me give you an example.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:14.020]   Let's say you bought a nice house, brand-new paint, and you have children
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.020]   aged 17, 10, and 3.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.020]   You go to work, you come back one day, and you see black marker just everywhere.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.020]   Would it make a difference, the kind of punishment that you carry out,
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:32.020]   if it was a 3-year-old, a 10-year-old, or a 17-year-old?
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.020]   If it is a 3-year-old, you would say, "He still needs to be punished because
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:41.020]   he needs to learn, to be corrected, because he just doesn't know any better."
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.020]   If a 10-year-old did it, you're 10 years old, you should have known.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.020]   We've been training you.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.020]   What happened to you?
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.020]   Why did you do this?
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.020]   And you're curious to find out what is his motive.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:57.020]   If a 17-year-old did it, you may assume he's trying to make a statement.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.020]   He knows what he's done.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.020]   You're 17 years old.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:05.020]   He must be angry with me.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.020]   He must be doing something.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:14.020]   But if you say, "No, I would carry out the same punishment, whether they are 3,
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:17.020]   or whether they are 10, whether they are 17.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:24.020]   We're going to have a parenting seminar," right, you would not,
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.020]   based upon their knowledge.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:33.020]   So he says to the church, "You've heard the gospel.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:39.020]   You had every opportunity, the examples, every opportunity to come to Christ,
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:43.020]   every opportunity to surrender your life, every opportunity to come to Christ
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.020]   and embrace the true grace that is taught in the Word of God,
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:51.020]   and you continue to live your life outside of the grace of God
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.020]   with your fingers crossed."
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:59.020]   I hope all of the scriptures aren't true.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:02.020]   I hope those parts where we're saved unconditionally,
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.020]   I hope those things are true.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.020]   And I've raised it all my life.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.020]   But when the Bible says, like, this passage in Hebrews 10, in Hebrews 2, in Hebrews 12,
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:12.020]   I hope those parts were not meant for us.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.020]   You know what's interesting?
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:18.020]   I had a conversation with somebody, and we opened up this text to them,
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:22.020]   Hebrews chapter 6, other parts of 1 John.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.020]   And you know what he said to me?
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:27.020]   "That's not for us.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.020]   That was written for the Jews.
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   So, therefore, it doesn't apply to me.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.020]   So I'm going to continue to do what I want."
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:39.020]   Cheap grace is what he chose to embrace.
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:44.020]   And whatever passages that didn't fit that, it wasn't for him.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:49.020]   There are many people who live that way without ever expressing that,
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:56.020]   believing that one day when they meet Christ that all of this was not for us.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:01.020]   That's why he says, "Do not refuse him."
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.020]   These are my words.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:07.020]   You can easily nullify me and say, "Well, you know, Pastor Peter, he has a certain kind of personality.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:10.020]   Everything is so black and white."
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:12.020]   That's him.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.020]   Yes, you're right.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.020]   I have a certain kind of personality.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.020]   It's all or nothing.
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.020]   You're right about that.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.020]   He's weak.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.020]   I've seen him.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.020]   He's so careless with his words.
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:23.020]   You're absolutely right.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:28.020]   I try so hard to work on that, and it's a thorn on my side.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   You know, and you're right.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.020]   I've seen him.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.020]   He's not perfect.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.020]   He doesn't practice everything he preaches.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:40.020]   You're absolutely right.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:45.020]   I want to, but I'm wrestling and struggling, and I want to be sanctified in all of those areas.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.020]   So you can easily nullify me.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020]   But what are you going to do with the Word?
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.020]   What are you going to do with the Word?
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.020]   What are you going to do with this passage?
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.020]   How are you going to nullify this?
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.020]   "Do not refuse him when you hear him."
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:14.020]   If there were consequences from what he warned in Sinai, how much more the God, who is fully revealed in his permanent home, speaks from heaven?
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   That's why it says in the book of James, "Not many of you should become teachers, because they will incur upon them a stricter judgment, because they know better."
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.020]   1 Thessalonians 2.13.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.020]   Remember that?
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:35.020]   When we were studying through that, the Thessalonians were known to be the model church in all of Macedonia.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:39.020]   And remember, Paul didn't spend a lot of time in Thessalonica.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.020]   He was only there for three Sundays.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:47.020]   So possibly he was there a month, and he got chased out because the persecution was so intense.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:51.020]   And you have to remember, Apostle Paul was not afraid to die.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:53.020]   He was ready to die.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:58.020]   Remember, when he was in Lystra, he got stoned, dragged out.
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.020]   He got up, went back in, and preached the gospel.
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.020]   This is not a man of fear.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.020]   He didn't run because he was afraid.
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.020]   They were going after the house church members.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:11.020]   He left to preserve them.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   And so after he left, he was concerned, so he sent a letter.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.020]   That's 1 Thessalonians.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.020]   To check up on them.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.020]   Because he left abruptly.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.020]   He didn't finish his work.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:26.020]   But all of a sudden, they come back with a report that their faith is growing, abounding.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:32.020]   Not only are they growing, they become the model church where people were talking about the Thessalonians.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:36.020]   They were loving each other, sacrificing in the midst of persecution.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.020]   And it wasn't because of years of discipleship.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:40.020]   It wasn't because of years of human effort.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.020]   He just preached the gospel.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.020]   And then he describes why.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.020]   Why and how they became the model church.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:51.020]   Even though his human work was not finished.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.020]   This is what he said, 1 Thessalonians 2.13.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:59.020]   For this reason, we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us,
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:05.020]   you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.020]   That was the key.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:12.020]   They heard God's word and they took this seriously.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.020]   That it's not just men.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.020]   It's not just people who are talking.
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.020]   God is speaking to us through this man.
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:24.020]   And as a result of that, it says, which also performs its work in you who believe.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:27.020]   Because they took the word of God seriously.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:32.020]   When Paul and his companions were speaking, they didn't just hear it as a bunch of philosophers coming into town.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:36.020]   They recognized God has sent these people.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.020]   God is speaking to me.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:47.020]   So when the word of God was open to them, they received it and believed, which caused them to love deeply.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:52.020]   To even forsake their own life.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:58.020]   You know why we have such struggles?
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:03.020]   Because the word of God does not have the same kind of authority that it had on them.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:07.020]   The word of God is open and we say, wow, there's so many opinions.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:10.020]   You say that, but they say this and they say that.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.020]   We use that as an excuse, oh, God is unknowable.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.020]   The word of God is unknowable.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:19.020]   So if there's so many opinions, what's the point?
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.020]   I've heard people say so much of that.
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:26.020]   So therefore, we can never be confident about anything.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:29.020]   You know who say that?
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.020]   People who don't study the Bible.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.020]   That's been my experience.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:38.020]   Maybe you can find somebody, but people don't study the Bible.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.020]   Study the Bible diligently, verse by verse.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:45.020]   See if you come out vague.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:48.020]   See if you come out saying, oh, we're so divided.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:52.020]   You'd be surprised how clear the word of God is.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.020]   You'd be surprised.
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:57.020]   Yes, it's been translated from another language.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.020]   But you'd be surprised.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:05.020]   God did not write the word of God that only scholars would understand.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:08.020]   And that's the genius of our God.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.020]   He wrote this Bible that even a Sunday school student can read it for himself
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.020]   and clearly understand who God is.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:20.020]   And even the deepest of scholars who has a PhD in theology will come and dig all
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:23.020]   of his life and never exhaust what it has to say.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.020]   That's the genius of the word of God.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:31.020]   So when somebody says, I read all of this stuff, and so because they say so many
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.020]   different things, how can we know anything?
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.020]   You know what that's like?
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:38.020]   That's just like somebody coming into the room and saying, you know what?
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:41.020]   I'm Michael Jordan.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:44.020]   Well, he says he's Michael Jordan.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.020]   That guy on television says he's Michael Jordan.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:51.020]   I heard another guy out in Santa Ana say he's Michael Jordan.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:54.020]   Kobe says he's Michael Jordan.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.020]   They all have different opinions.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:00.020]   So the end conclusion is we can never know.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.020]   We can never know.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.020]   That would be ridiculous.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:09.020]   I'm 5'6".
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:13.020]   Do I have to tell the rest?
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.020]   Michael Jordan is 6'6".
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.020]   He has different skin tones.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   It's not that hard.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:30.020]   But to simply dismiss the clear word of God because you hear different opinions
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:37.020]   is simply, if we're not careful, an excuse not to engage the word.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.020]   Do not refuse him.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:41.020]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:45.020]   1 Peter 2, 2-3, it says, "Like newborn babies,
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:51.020]   long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.020]   if you've tasted the kindness of God."
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:58.020]   In other words, if you've really known the grace of God, the taste of the kindness of God,
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:03.020]   if you've really understood, if you've really professed, if you've really embraced the true grace of God,
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:10.020]   tasted the kindness of God, like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the word.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:13.020]   Do you notice here he compares like a newborn babe?
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:19.020]   If you've ever seen a baby who is born into the world for the first time,
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:23.020]   it's surprising.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.020]   He was never taught.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:28.020]   You know, they don't come out and then we have, you know, we have discipleship.
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.020]   This is how you're going to survive, right?
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.020]   Just suck, right?
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.020]   We don't tell them that.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.020]   They come out sucking.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:39.020]   How do they know that?
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.020]   From with their mouth.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.020]   How do they know?
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:46.020]   Who told them that food is supposed to go into their mouth?
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:50.020]   They're born from the first second that they're born.
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:54.020]   They come out wanting food.
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.020]   So he says, compare.
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:03.020]   So like newborn babes, that God instinctively placed in you when you were born again.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:10.020]   Instinctively, God has placed in you a longing for his word.
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:14.020]   But you notice here he says, like newborn babes, long for what?
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.020]   Pure milk.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:21.020]   Not the watered down milk, not the imitation milk, not the milk substitute,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.020]   but the pure milk.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.020]   Pure milk.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:30.020]   Not the kind of milk that you want that's going to tickle your ears.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.020]   Not the kind of milk that's like, oh, I feel very encouraged where I can continue to live
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:38.020]   with me at the center, willfully denying Christ.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:40.020]   I'm still at the center.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.020]   I'm just active at church.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:47.020]   I'm still concerned about me, but I'm still practicing at church.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:51.020]   You know, the idea of tithing in the Old Testament was that they were to offer up
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:56.020]   the 10% as a representative that all of it belonged to God.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.020]   So some people say, you know what, New Testament, it doesn't teach tithing.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:04.020]   You're right, because the Old Testament was trying to build the kingdom of Israel.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.020]   And so they gave 10% to build the temple, to build the national Israel.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:14.020]   We come to the New Testament, it says, no, we're not in a period at the end times
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.020]   when Israel is restored.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:20.020]   God's going to fulfill his promise, but we're in a period where God is building
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.020]   his spiritual kingdom.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:26.020]   So it's not about the 10% anymore.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.020]   So Chief Grace says, because we're not about the 10%, we're not obligated to give anything.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.020]   In fact, read the Bible carefully.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:37.020]   In the New Covenant, we are obligated to give everything.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:41.020]   Everything.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.020]   The idea of tithing was to teach us that.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:48.020]   So that when the New Covenant came, we can surrender all of it.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:55.020]   And whatever it is that we have to be used for his kingdom, all of it,
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:59.020]   is because of Chief Grace.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:07.020]   We have perverted the gospel, perverted the church, perverted our witness,
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:13.020]   and lost our witness in Christ if we're not careful.
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:17.020]   Do not refuse him.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:24.020]   And like I said, all you have to do today to refuse him is to hear the word of God,
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:29.020]   hear the warnings, hear their encouragement.
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:32.020]   Don't do anything.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.020]   Go home.
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:36.020]   Do a good job at work.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.020]   Get your raises.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:39.020]   Get married.
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.020]   Have children.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.020]   Buy a good house.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:43.020]   Make good investments.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:46.020]   Save enough money so you can retire.
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:50.020]   And if you're good with your money, leave some behind for your children.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.020]   And then die.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:59.020]   Everything I said there innately is not sinful.
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:06.020]   But if that is our primary pursuit, if that is our primary goal,
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:12.020]   we have to ask ourselves, "Is Christ really Lord?
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:15.020]   Is he really Lord?
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:18.020]   Have we truly been crucified with Christ?
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:26.020]   And it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives with me, in me."
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:33.020]   The hope that we have in Jesus Christ is because we have surrendered our life here.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:39.020]   And so when Christ returns, we will know true life when he comes.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:45.020]   But if your kingdom is here, if your pursuit is here,
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:49.020]   Jesus' second coming is going to disrupt your life.
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:53.020]   Innately, you do not desire a second coming.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:56.020]   You're in the middle of escrow.
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:59.020]   You started a new business.
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.020]   You're putting away for retirement.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.020]   You just bought a new house.
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.020]   Your children just entered college.
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:12.020]   If Jesus comes, he's going to disrupt all of that.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:16.020]   Only those who have truly surrendered their life in Christ
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:20.020]   will be eagerly waiting for his coming.
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:24.020]   Do not refuse him who is speaking.
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.020]   These are not my words but his.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:36.020]   Let's pray.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.020]   If I can ask you to take some time to not just to pray for yourself,
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:45.020]   pray for the nominal Christians in your life
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   who are professing to believe God and yet living in cheap grace.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:58.020]   So many people, as Jesus says, who says, "Lord, Lord,"
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:03.020]   will not enter the kingdom of heaven because they did not really know God.
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:06.020]   They're in the church, in the hundreds, in the thousands,
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.020]   maybe even in the millions.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:13.020]   Pray for them, your brothers, your sisters, your parents.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.020]   Pray for your coworkers.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:20.020]   Pray for the people around us that we do not embrace cheap grace,
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:25.020]   this cultural Christianity that has nothing to do with God,
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:30.020]   that we do not hold on to the grace of God simply as a security blanket
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:35.020]   but the power of God unto salvation to those who genuinely believe.
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:37.020]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.020]   Pray for ourselves.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.020]   Examine ourselves.
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.020]   Is it true grace that I have received?
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.020]   Is it true grace that I have professed?
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.020]   And then pray for those around us.
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:51.020]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us.

[01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:03.020]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.020]   [music]
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:27.020]   Amazing grace.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:36.020]   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:45.020]   that saved a wretch like me.
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:55.020]   I once was lost, but now am found.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:03.020]   Was blind, but now I see.
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:07.020]   [music]
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:19.020]   Just praise the dawn, my heart to fear.
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:28.020]   Embrace my fears, relieved.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:38.020]   O precious day, let grace appear.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:46.020]   Be our right first belief.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:50.020]   [music]
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:35:02.020]   The Lord has promised good to me.
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:12.020]   His word my hope secures.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:21.020]   He will my share and portion be.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:30.020]   As long as life endures.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:34.020]   [music]
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:46.020]   When we've been there ten thousand years,
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:55.020]   the light shining as the sun,
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:36:05.020]   we've no less days to sing God's praise
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:13.020]   than when we first begun.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:15.020]   No less days.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:24.020]   No less days to sing God's praise
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:33.020]   than when we first begun.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.020]   Let's pray.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:41.020]   Joel chapter 2 verse 11 through 14.
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:46.020]   The Lord utters his voice before his army.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.020]   Surely his camp is very great.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:51.020]   For strong is he who carries out his word.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:54.020]   The day of the Lord is indeed great and very awesome
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.020]   and who can endure it?
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.020]   And even now declares the Lord,
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.020]   return to me with all your heart
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:01.020]   and with fasting, weeping and mourning
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:04.020]   and rend your heart and not your garments.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:06.020]   Now return to the Lord your God
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.020]   for he is gracious and compassionate,
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:11.020]   slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.020]   and relenting of evil.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:17.020]   Who knows whether he will not turn and relent
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.020]   and leave a blessing behind him.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:24.020]   Lord, we pray that the word that you've implanted
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:26.020]   in our hearts, Lord, would bear fruit.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:30.020]   That none of us in this room would refuse you.
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:34.020]   That we would hear your words and your words only.
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:38.020]   That as your sheep that we would follow you,
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.020]   follow you only.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.020]   Lord, again we pray, Father God,
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.020]   with all our brothers and sisters
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.020]   who are suffering around the world.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.020]   Help us, Lord, not to take for granted what we have,
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:49.020]   the freedom that we have,
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:52.020]   that we would not use it simply to indulge ourselves.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:55.020]   That we would fellowship, partner, Lord God,
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:57.020]   with our brothers and sisters around the world
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:00.020]   and we lift and intercede on their behalf.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.020]   So we pray, Father, the rest of this week,
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:05.020]   may it truly be surrendered for your use.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:07.020]   In Jesus' name we pray.
