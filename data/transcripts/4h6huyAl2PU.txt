[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.540]   Sorry.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.940]   Every week, we have this tremendous and wonderful privilege
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.980]   to be able to gather before a holy, holy God for worship,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.100]   and God calls us to worship him,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.460]   and we come not because of what we have done,
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.180]   but it's only because of what Christ has done for us
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.700]   on the cross that we can come.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.740]   So our God truly is worthy of our worship,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.540]   and so as we gather this morning,
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.540]   I pray that we gather with much gratitude
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.460]   and with much joy to come and honor and to sing to him.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.220]   So this morning, as we begin our service,
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.500]   we're gonna sing together the hymn "Holy, Holy, Holy."

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.660]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.780]   We have, first of all, good news.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.140]   You may have noticed as you were coming in
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.740]   that we, our sister Susan Fongray
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.060]   was able to get us more parking.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.740]   So the parking was an issue.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.740]   I told you that, you know,
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.100]   so some of you guys moved to First Service as a result.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.500]   But that G lot, I don't know if you know
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.420]   where the G lot is, but G lot is where
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.580]   all the shuttle is going.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.580]   So right next to that building,
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.220]   there's another building right like to the right of it,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.980]   and there's about another 85 parking spots
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.300]   that that was secured for us.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.980]   And so if that lot gets full,
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.420]   you can just park right next door, okay?
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.500]   So there'll be attendants there to tell you where to go,
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.620]   so just look for that.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.660]   And then along with that,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.020]   we were able to get another shuttle.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.340]   They told us that they needed another one,
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.980]   so if you notice a big van coming and pulling up,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.460]   it doesn't have the church sign yet.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.740]   They're not trying to abduct you.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.860]   It is our church.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.180]   So until we get the sign, you know,
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.580]   you'll know that there's another white Mercedes Sprinter
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.460]   that's coming around.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.420]   That's also our shuttle.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.300]   So it'll be going to that same area,
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.140]   so you can park there,
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.580]   and they'll shuttle you back, okay?
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.580]   College ministry, at 1 p.m. after the third service,
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.780]   there's gonna be a college ministry welcome lunch
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.020]   at the youth chapel.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.060]   It's starting at 1 o'clock.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.020]   Our youth group has their service there,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.340]   so please do not go into that room before 1.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.140]   And so just stick around outside.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.340]   If you are participating, if you're a college student,
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.660]   or if you're one of the team members
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.020]   who are going to be going helping,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.260]   just stay there, make sure that they're all done,
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.020]   and then you can go in afterwards, okay?
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.260]   So just stick around there.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.660]   Don't open the door.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.980]   Again, that's happening at 1 o'clock.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.380]   So if you're a college student,
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.820]   and you have some questions,
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.900]   you're checking out the church,
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.100]   and you wanna know what this church is about,
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.180]   this lunch is for you.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.180]   It's at 1 p.m., okay?
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.580]   Vine, our youth group,
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.420]   there's gonna be a fundraiser next Sunday
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.000]   in between the third, second and third,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.260]   and then third afterwards.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.740]   So it's only gonna be happening second, third,
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.300]   not after the first service.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.500]   And it's gonna be a fundraiser that they're having
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.820]   for their youth retreat that's coming up next year.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.580]   They're serving Mediterranean chicken bowl
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.220]   for $10 for adults and five for children.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.500]   So please stick around for that.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.820]   And the reason why they're having that,
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.940]   obviously it was a fundraiser,
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.780]   but also because we have a members meeting
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.500]   that's happening at 2 p.m.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.220]   So if you are a member of the church,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.100]   or you're being announced as a new member of the church,
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.120]   it's happening at 2 p.m.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.700]   So you can grab lunch here,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.540]   and then stick around,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.220]   and right at 2 p.m. we're gonna be starting.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   And then right after the members meeting,
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.700]   we have another service fair.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.660]   So service fair is all the different service teams
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.660]   that are happening at church.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.840]   They'll be set up outside.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.780]   So you can go visit just for information for some,
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   and then there's some service teams that needs help.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.980]   So if you go to that table,
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.620]   and you wanna serve in certain capacity,
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.860]   you can go and visit that.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.140]   And that's happening next week after the members meeting.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.300]   Child safety training is happening on Sunday
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.480]   on October 20th and 1/30.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.060]   So if you are working with children,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.660]   or planning to work with children at church,
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.000]   this is a mandatory training for the church.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.340]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.260]   That's happening on 1/30 in October 20th.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.100]   Reformation night,
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.860]   which is our replacement for Halloween at our church,
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.580]   at October 31st, starting at 5/30.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.720]   So they're taking sign-ups.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.700]   If you are planning to bring a child or a child's friend,
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.700]   you do need to sign up,
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.820]   because we have limited space in our parking area.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.220]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.380]   As you go outside,
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.020]   there'll be a table there that you can sign up for.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.620]   Okay, and that's happening October 31st.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.300]   And then regional Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.540]   So up 'til last week,
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.140]   they were taking people who have volunteered
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.420]   to open up their homes to service that.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.640]   I was told that they have enough of that,
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.220]   but now they're starting to open up
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.180]   for people who will participate.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.900]   Okay, so they're gonna be divided into home groups
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.020]   to about 20, 25 people.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.260]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.540]   You do not need to be a member to participate in this.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.100]   So if you go outside, you'll run to a table,
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.140]   and you can sign up there.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.600]   There is a sign-up thing online,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.500]   but obviously it'd be quicker and faster
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.940]   if you did it here after service, okay?
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.540]   I think that's it.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.180]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.740]   I'll give you a minute to give your offering,
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.540]   and then if you, again, brought a physical offering,
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.260]   there's a box in the back on the way out.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.360]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.340]   Father, we thank you so much for your goodness,
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.300]   your love, your grace, Father God,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.560]   that sustains us.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.020]   Help us, especially today,
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.000]   as we celebrate the communion table,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.940]   that you would ready our hearts through worship,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.980]   through the teaching,
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.480]   or even in our giving,
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.900]   that it may all be an expression of gratitude toward you
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.200]   and your powerful work in us.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.460]   I pray that you would bless this time,
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.660]   bless the worship that we give you.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.960]   May it be multiplied, even this offering,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.180]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.040]   Would you please stand and take a moment
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.240]   to greet those around you,
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.040]   and we will continue our worship.

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:23.580]   - If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter nine,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.740]   I'll be reading verse 26 and 27.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.660]   But 27 we'll be covering with the next section.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.620]   And I'll explain when we get there.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.500]   But I'll be reading both verses 26 and 27.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.340]   For whoever is ashamed of me, in my words,
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.700]   the Son of Man will be ashamed of him
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.380]   when he comes in his glory, in the glory of the Father
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.580]   and of the holy angels.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.980]   But I say to you truthfully,
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.500]   there are some of those who are standing here
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.380]   who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.220]   Let's pray.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.940]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.140]   Thank you, Father, for your Holy Spirit
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.500]   that guides us and leads us and empowers us
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.860]   that we may worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.460]   We pray that your word would speak to us,
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.500]   challenge us, mold us,
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.540]   according to your word and your will.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.620]   I wanna read a text to you from Ezekiel,
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.460]   chapter 33, one through six.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.340]   And this is the calling of Ezekiel as the watchman
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.340]   and what responsibility has been given to all watchmen.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.340]   It says, "And the word of the Lord came to me saying,
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.140]   "Son of man, speak to the sons of your people
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.360]   "and say to them, if I bring a sword upon a land
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.000]   "and the people of the land take one man from among them
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.100]   "and make him their watchman.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.260]   "And he sees the sword coming upon the land
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.860]   "and blows on the trumpet and warns the people.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.540]   "Then he who hears the sound of the trumpet
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.600]   "and does not take warning and a sword comes
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.300]   "and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.980]   "Hear the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning,
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.300]   "his blood will be on himself.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.360]   "But had he taken warning, he would have delivered his life.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.180]   "But if the watchman sees the sword coming
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.060]   "and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.960]   "and a sword comes and takes away the person from them,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.000]   "he is taken away in his iniquity,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.300]   "but his blood I will require from the watchman's hand."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:27.420]   This is a very sobering text as God calls Ezekiel
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.100]   and the watchman for the nation of Israel saying,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.560]   "If I tell you that a judgment is coming
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.700]   "and you do your job and you warn people
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.840]   "and they refuse to turn, then you've done your job
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.300]   "and judgment is gonna come upon them.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.680]   "But if I tell you that this is coming
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.700]   "and you do not warn the people
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.160]   "and they do not turn from their sin,
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.560]   "not only would they be judged,"
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.960]   he says, "you will be judged for not speaking up
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.860]   "and telling them and not doing your job."
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.700]   Now this is a calling to Ezekiel,
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.600]   it's a calling to all watchmen.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.900]   And I don't think it's a far stretch to say
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.180]   that this is a calling for all churches,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.020]   this is a calling for all Christians.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.220]   The very nature of what you and I profess
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.200]   requires that we speak up,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.300]   requires us to share the truth.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.220]   Because the central message of the gospel
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.100]   isn't simply that God loves you
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.820]   and has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.440]   And if that's the only message that people know,
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.780]   then there's no sense of urgency,
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.580]   there's no call to repentance.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.340]   Just open your heart to receive him,
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.420]   come to church, receive the blessing of Jesus,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.060]   and live your life the way you desire.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.420]   But the central message of the cross begins
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.540]   by saying that we have rebelled against God.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.100]   And all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.540]   and as a result of that, the judgment of God is waiting.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.840]   God is not happy with this world.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.580]   So when he comes in his full glory,
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.260]   he's going to come to bring judgment
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.260]   for every deed, every word that was spoken
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.700]   in rebellion against God.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.620]   So the very nature of the gospel message,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.460]   the good news, is meant to be proclaimed.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.740]   You cannot tell somebody that I have this fantastic news
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.900]   and then not tell them.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.060]   Either you don't have the good news,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.520]   or I don't think you believe that you have the good news.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.060]   But you can't tell people that I believe the good news,
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.220]   it saved my life and it can save your life,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.660]   and then not tell them.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.980]   The very nature, the very nature of the gospel
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.660]   that we proclaim to believe requires
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.220]   that we proclaim it, that we tell people about it.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.180]   The reason why Jesus told his disciples
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.300]   that if you want to follow after me to deny yourself,
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.980]   pick up your cross daily and follow me,
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.260]   isn't simply because Jesus was telling them
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.100]   that your Christian life is going to be difficult,
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.420]   that after I leave, I'm not going to be able to feed you,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.780]   I'm not going to be taking care of you,
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.060]   that you're going to have hardship in life,
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.240]   you're going to have marriage problems,
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.620]   you're going to have a hard time paying your bills,
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.100]   and so therefore, you need to learn to deny yourself.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.600]   That's not what he was saying.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.280]   The reason why he told them to prepare themselves
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.340]   and to deny themselves and pick up their cross
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.420]   is because what he was going to commission them to do.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.260]   If they just kept their mouths shut,
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.120]   and they lived their life and did what Jesus did,
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.100]   they got the power that Jesus had,
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.920]   performing miracles, healed the sick,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.620]   maybe once a year, they had a feeding of the 5,000.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.320]   Every once in a while, there's a storm
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.020]   and there's hardship and people are afraid to die,
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.260]   and they come in and they stop the storm.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.820]   Maybe there's injustices taking place
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.320]   and Jesus is coming and make that right.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.740]   If they functioned, they just did what Jesus did,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.080]   they would have been celebrities.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.100]   People would have loved them,
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.320]   they would have had a very easy, comfortable, posh life.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.860]   But it's because what Jesus was calling them to say,
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.020]   that he knew that hardship was coming,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.820]   that the path that I'm going to
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.440]   is not going to end in glory, not immediately.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.080]   It's going to happen when I come in glory,
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.900]   but it's not going to happen immediately.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.360]   As I went to the cross, you will also go to the cross.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.540]   So he was preparing them.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.800]   In order to be a follower of Christ,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.840]   we said we need to know who Jesus is,
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.740]   we need to go where Jesus goes,
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.360]   and we need to say what he says.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.540]   In Luke 9, 26, it says,
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.420]   "For whoever is ashamed of me and my words,
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.260]   "the Son of Man will be ashamed of him
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.560]   "when he comes in his glory,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.220]   "in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.080]   You and I could live a very posh, comfortable life
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.980]   as long as you keep the gospel to yourself.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.360]   We keep hearing, especially in our generation,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.920]   we need to preach the gospel to ourself,
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.760]   we need to preach the gospel to ourself.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.020]   All this is true.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.000]   But what you really need to do
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.200]   is to preach the gospel to others,
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.880]   not simply to yourselves, not simply comfort yourself,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.800]   not simply to remind you, I'm saved,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   I'm loved unconditionally, that it's not by my words.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.680]   It's important.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.780]   But what we really need to do
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.620]   is to commit to preach the gospel,
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.600]   'cause you can preach the gospel to yourself
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.160]   until the day you die
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.260]   and never experience any persecution.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.720]   You're just constantly reminding myself
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.320]   that I'm good, I'm good, because Jesus loves me,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.800]   I'm good because Jesus loves me,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.720]   and keep preaching the gospel to yourself.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.560]   And I'm not saying that that's wrong,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.600]   but part of the reason why we are in the condition
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.960]   that we are and why we need to keep reminding ourselves
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.320]   of the gospel is because we're not preaching to others.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.880]   One of the benefits of being a pastor
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.200]   is that this is my job, so I have to preach,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.320]   and I want to preach, so the gospel is proclaimed.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.520]   So I can never, I can never forget the gospel,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.360]   but is that only the calling of the pastor?
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.640]   Is that only for the calling
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.120]   for somebody who stands up in the pulpit?
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.160]   No, the reason why in our generation,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.080]   why we keep hearing we need to preach the gospel
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.980]   to ourselves is because we're not preaching it
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.680]   to other people, we're not telling other people.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.160]   Best way to learn something is not simply for you to learn,
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.480]   but to practice it.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.840]   And those of you who are teachers,
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.600]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.120]   We're going over the 10 covenant.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.280]   The people who benefit most from the 10 covenant
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.720]   are the ones who are leading,
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   'cause they're teaching other people.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.680]   Jesus is warning his disciples
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.560]   that at the end of this road,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.200]   you're going to see me on the cross,
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.980]   and if you don't prepare yourself also to go to the cross,
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.280]   you're not going to make it.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.000]   Matthew 10, 16 through 17 says,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.700]   "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.360]   "So be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves,
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.040]   "but beware of men, for they will hand you over to courts
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.080]   "and scourge you in their synagogues."
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.680]   Jesus told his disciples that you keep coming,
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.720]   you keep following me.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.360]   I'm going to say some things that's going to disturb them,
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.640]   and because of me, not despite the fact
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.880]   that you were a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.040]   but because you were a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.200]   he said they're going to hate you, they're going to scourge you.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.120]   He doesn't say that if you make the wrong decision,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.400]   if you go to the wrong place where you shouldn't go.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.520]   Maybe you didn't say it in a gentle way.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.280]   You didn't say it in a way that's acceptable.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.000]   He says, no, because you're going to say
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.760]   what I'm going to tell you to say because of me,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.960]   they're going to hate you.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.480]   Because of me, they're going to scourge you.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.560]   He's not saying it might happen,
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.120]   that if something goes wrong,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.080]   that maybe if you didn't pray hard enough,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.600]   that maybe you didn't prepare enough,
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.120]   maybe you weren't trained enough.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.480]   No, he said, because of me, you will be scourged.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.000]   Matthew 10, 21 to 22.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.720]   "Brother will betray brother to death,
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.400]   "and a father his child and children
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.920]   "will rise up against parents
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.160]   "and cause them to be put to death.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.840]   "Because of my words, it's going to divide families."
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.960]   The truth is going to divide families.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.560]   A father, a mother, a child to the parents,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.320]   because the gospel, either you love it
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.120]   or you're going to hate it.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.640]   He said, you will be hated by all because of my name.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.280]   But it is the one who has endured to the end
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.320]   who will be saved.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.200]   And again, he reminds him in Matthew 10, 24,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.080]   "A disciple is not above his teacher,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.560]   "nor a slave above his master."
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.920]   If the master is hated because of his speech,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.640]   because of the things that he's proclaiming,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.240]   repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.160]   Bear fruit in accordance to repentance.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.360]   If the master preaches this, and we are his servants,
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.280]   and we go out representing the master,
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.840]   but they love us, but they hate the master,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.080]   something has gone wrong.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.920]   They love us.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.360]   How kind we are, how nice we are, how generous we are.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.880]   But they hate Christ.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.680]   And we're no longer his servants.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.760]   Because we have improperly represented him.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.960]   And so he says, "If I am your teacher,
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.720]   "if I am your master, and if you are a good servant,
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.440]   "what happened to me will happen to you."
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.920]   All of this can be easily avoided
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.520]   if we just keep our mouths shut.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.800]   Just be a good citizen.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.960]   Pay your taxes.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.720]   When disasters happen, get some money.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.080]   Fawn a lot, go help the people who are hurting.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.440]   Fight against sex trafficking.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.280]   Fight against immorality.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.520]   You will be loved.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.400]   No one's gonna hate you for that.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.440]   And if you do a good job,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.960]   you might even become a celebrity.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.040]   You're a great citizen.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.320]   But if you do what I do, if you say what I say,
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.040]   he says, "They will hate you as they hated me."
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.000]   And that's why he says,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.200]   "If you're ashamed of me and my words."
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.600]   Why would anybody be ashamed of Jesus
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.880]   who died for us and loves us unconditionally,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.840]   who feeds the poor and raises the dead?
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.040]   Why would anybody be ashamed of that Jesus?
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.640]   No, it is not that Jesus that we're talking about.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.480]   It's the Jesus who called out sinners.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.080]   It's the Jesus who warned the world
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.960]   that if they don't repent, judgment is coming upon them.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.240]   It's the Jesus who called out hypocrisy.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:42.360]   It's that Jesus that they would be afraid to be ashamed of.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:48.000]   What causes shame for Jesus and his words?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.920]   First and foremost, fear of man.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.360]   We're so concerned about what other people will think of us,
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.000]   whether it is a close friend, a family member,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.560]   or a coworker, or oftentimes even strangers,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.320]   that the fear of man has gripped us so much
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.760]   that every decision that we make,
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.200]   every place that we go, is dictated by,
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.520]   well, we're concerned about what other people will think.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.720]   Paul says in Galatians 1:10,
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.840]   "Am I now seeking the favor of men or of God?
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.320]   "Or am I striving to please men?
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.960]   "If I were still trying to please men,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.080]   "I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.680]   If what you say and don't say is dictated by fear
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.000]   of what they will think and the consequences
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.160]   that will come from other people,
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.380]   and he says, "Then you're no longer a servant of God.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.520]   "You're a servant of man because your decisions
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.560]   "are dictated by what they will think,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.840]   "not what God will think."
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.080]   Not just the fear of man, but the love of this world,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.000]   which is interrelated.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   If love of this world is what characterize who we are,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.520]   you will be ashamed.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.680]   Because what Jesus says breaks into the darkness.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.360]   He's basically telling the whole world
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.760]   that your whole life is based upon sin.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.000]   He's not simply saying, "Make sure your Sundays
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.400]   "are spent on Sunday morning."
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.800]   That's not the calling of a Christian.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.640]   A calling of a Christian is your whole life
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.400]   was founded upon a rebellion against God.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.320]   Every thought that we have was against God.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.360]   We are living in rebellion.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.860]   So the gospel basically tells us,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.760]   tells the sinners to turn, to turn from their whole life.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.460]   In James 4:4, it says, "You adulterous do not know
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.420]   "that friendship with the world is hostility toward God."
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.880]   He's not saying friendship with the world
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.520]   is incongruent with God.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.840]   He said it's hostile to God.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.680]   "Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.120]   "makes himself an enemy of God."
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.640]   You see how these words are extreme?
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.800]   He's trying to make it extreme.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.200]   There's no middle ground.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.800]   Either you will hate God or hate the world,
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.240]   but you cannot do both.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.800]   You can love God or love the world,
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.220]   but you cannot do both.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.800]   They're against each other.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.440]   You cannot pursue the world and be concerned
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.600]   and desire and covet the things of this world
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.680]   and then say, "I'm a friend of God."
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.800]   2 Timothy 4:10, it says, "For Demas,
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.520]   "having loved this present world, has deserted me."
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.920]   Here's a man who basically ditched
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   a handpicked apostle from Christ, Apostle Paul.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.880]   This man performs miracles.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.360]   This is a man that Jesus single-handedly chose
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.080]   to be the apostle to the Gentiles,
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.800]   and Demas was a coworker, a disciple of him,
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.160]   and he just walked away.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.840]   It wasn't because of wrong doctrine.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.580]   It wasn't because he had a wrong view of Jesus.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.880]   He just said simply 'cause he loved the world.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:04.160]   And if you look at 2,000 years of Christianity
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.400]   and people who have fallen away from their faith,
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.100]   and they'll give you all kinds of reasons
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.500]   how the church disappointed them
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.260]   and how this and that happened and this happened in life,
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.380]   but at the end, when you dig deep enough,
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.820]   the end conclusion was they loved the world more than God.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:27.040]   If the love of the world is what dictates
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.620]   what we do and don't do, it's just a matter of time
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.360]   that this shame for Christ is gonna get to us.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   I remember years ago when I was a youth pastor,
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.240]   I remember being convicted about this and said,
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.460]   how can I get my youth group to stand up for Christ?
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.720]   And I had an idea.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.200]   Said, I'm gonna take my youth group street preaching.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.100]   And then so I took them out to street preaching.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.340]   I said, where can I go to take them street preaching
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:01.180]   where they're gonna require some prayer and boldness?
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.820]   So I took them to their own schools.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.480]   During the lunchtime, or was it right after?
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.460]   Elder Joe was one of them.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.140]   And so we went, and I, in the corner,
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.420]   as the cars were coming out,
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.780]   and we began to preach the gospel,
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.980]   and obviously, we're weird people, right?
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.580]   And I don't remember, I think Elder Joe was also there,
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.980]   and he was preaching, so he stood in the corner
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.420]   and just preaching the gospel.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.760]   And obviously, after that, you can never be,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.300]   you can never be cool, right?
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.800]   So the world died for them at that day.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.260]   You can't go street preaching in your public high school
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.120]   and then come out and then try to be cool, right?
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:44.420]   Our fear of losing the world causes us to be timid.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:51.200]   We're so afraid of not being cool, or being seen as weird.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.120]   And that's enough for us to keep our mouth closed.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.620]   And think about what it is that we are not saying.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.740]   The judgment of God is coming.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.660]   We all know, sooner or later, we're going to die.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.560]   The only way of salvation is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.940]   Think about what it is that we refuse to say,
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:15.500]   simply because we don't want them to see us as weird.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:22.080]   The power that peer pressure has on people,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.820]   that we can live our lives ashamed
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.060]   of the one who died for us,
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.620]   simply because we don't wanna be seen weird
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.880]   by people that really have done nothing for us.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.580]   Third and finally, what causes us to be timid
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.620]   is our own sins and compromise.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.200]   When you allow sin and compromise
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.040]   to be a regular part of your life,
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.400]   the first thing that happens is you won't be a witness,
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.540]   because the devil is going to use that and say,
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.180]   how can God use you?
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.500]   What a hypocrite, keep your mouth shut.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.300]   What a hypocrite.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.220]   And so that thought is so prevalent in your mind
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.780]   that I don't have the right to tell about God.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.620]   And so as soon as you allow sin
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.980]   to continue to pervade your life,
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.860]   you feel like the only thing you can do
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.700]   is just to keep quiet.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.700]   You say, I love Jesus.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.020]   I'm gonna preach the gospel to myself,
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.360]   to remind me that Christ loves me unconditionally.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.420]   But you can never preach the gospel to other people,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.000]   because Satan will use your sin to keep you quiet.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.460]   He says the consequence of this
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.620]   is that I will be ashamed of you when I come in glory,
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.040]   in the glory of the Father and of the angels.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.340]   Now that scene, when Jesus comes in glory,
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.740]   in glory of the Father and the angels,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.740]   is always in reference to him coming,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.540]   his second coming and his judgment.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:51.380]   He came as a son of man to serve and to save.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.380]   But the scripture tells us that in his second coming,
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.460]   he's going to come in his full glory.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.340]   And the reason why he will come in full glory
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.420]   is because he will come to confront evil.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.200]   He will come to confront sin.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.860]   So when he says, when he comes in full glory,
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.460]   as you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.700]   In other words, when the wrath of God comes,
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.940]   I will not protect you from the wrath of God.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.940]   I will not cover you.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.700]   I will not stand between you and my Father
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.140]   and say, I'm covered, I've covered them.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.340]   He says, I will not cover you.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.380]   Those are pretty serious.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.020]   He's not simply saying, I'm gonna slap you
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.540]   and I'm not gonna give you the reward that you deserve.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.380]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.700]   He said, I'm gonna say, I didn't know you.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.280]   You called me Lord, Lord, but I never knew.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.780]   You had nothing to do with me.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:50.260]   I hope you're disturbed, right?
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.420]   Not simply because I'm saying it,
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.660]   because this is what Jesus says.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:58.660]   So does this mean that because you haven't
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.740]   stood in the corners, you know, street corners
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.180]   and preached the gospel, that you're not saved?
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.420]   That because you had an opportunity to share
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.180]   and then you kind of like were timid
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.020]   that you're not saved?
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.120]   Is that what this means?
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.340]   Who's the biggest denier in the Bible?
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.420]   Who's known as a denier in the Bible?
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.380]   You know it, right?
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.540]   Just being Asian.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.760]   Who's the biggest denier in the Bible?
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:36.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.860]   Peter, right?
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.580]   Peter is the biggest denier.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.640]   He stood in front of Jesus.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.820]   I don't know this man.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.940]   He even cursed because he was afraid.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.380]   So does that mean that because he denied Jesus,
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.860]   he was ashamed of him, that when he comes in glory,
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.620]   he said I didn't know Peter either?
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.340]   Clearly that's not what he means.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.540]   I mean he's the apostle.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.340]   He's the leader among the apostles, right?
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.500]   He is restored, but what he means is
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.300]   this is in reference to somebody
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:14.820]   who has no interest in sharing the gospel.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.420]   Have never shared the gospel.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.360]   Have no plans to share the gospel.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.940]   Because what he's attracted to is not Christ.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.120]   What he's attracted to is not the truth of the gospel.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.060]   In every way, he's rejected Christ.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.140]   He loves the church.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.860]   He loves the benefit of Christianity.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.540]   He loves the people in the church.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.960]   He loves Christians.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.720]   But he does not know Christ.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.220]   So the reason why he's ashamed of him and his words
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.140]   is because he never really believed.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.580]   He never really believed.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.020]   He was in the church, participates,
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.860]   enjoys all the benefits, studies the Bible.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.340]   Maybe he's a scholar.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.740]   He might even be a preacher.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.120]   But he doesn't really believe.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.980]   Romans 8.1, therefore there is now no condemnation
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.720]   for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.420]   This is in reference, this is not in reference
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.680]   to somebody who needs to learn to be bold.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.380]   This is somebody who may be sitting in this room
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.100]   and say, you know what, I don't know if I need to do that.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.940]   You know, like the preachers are called,
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.700]   the missionaries are called.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.300]   But that's not for me, right?
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.140]   That's not for me.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.180]   I just want to live my life.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.720]   I want to come to church and I want to hear a sermon
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.520]   that's encouraging so that I can go back
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.180]   and make good money, take care of my kids,
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.660]   and put away enough for retirement.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.020]   And I got to serve the church in the background.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.620]   I just want to be quiet Christian in the background.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.300]   But feel no sense of urgency to share this gospel,
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.500]   to anybody, that's someone else's job, maybe.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:55.720]   Maybe the reason why is because you don't really believe.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.560]   Maybe.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:04.020]   What gives us boldness, right?
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.600]   Well, first of all, conviction.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.920]   Do we really believe this?
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.620]   Paul says in Philippians 1.20, he says,
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.620]   according to my earnest expectation and hope
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.440]   that I will not be put to shame in anything,
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.940]   but that with all boldness, Christ will even now
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.300]   as always be exalted in my body,
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.100]   whether by life or by death.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.100]   Here's Apostle Paul who is possibly waiting for execution
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.140]   and he's not sitting there writing a letter
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.100]   to people who are sitting at homes and say,
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.400]   "Get me out of here."
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.180]   There's people who are preaching the gospel
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.240]   simply to make it harder for him.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.820]   And instead of complaining about that,
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.740]   he said, "Praise God."
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.300]   Whether by good or bad motive, he's preaching the gospel.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.380]   And he was a single-minded person.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.820]   He says, "Whether by life or by death,
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.300]   "my only concern is that I would not be ashamed.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.620]   "That whether I'm executed or whether I get to live,
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:01.620]   "my only concern is that I am bold for Jesus."
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.500]   What gave him this kind of courage?
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.500]   What gave him this kind of courage?
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.100]   Well, that's why Jesus chose him, 'cause he was special,
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.500]   because he was a man of courage,
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.060]   because he comes from a certain pedigree.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.220]   No.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:20.740]   He met the living Savior and he was convicted
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.800]   that this was true.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:27.120]   He says in Romans 1:16, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.260]   "for it is the power of God for salvation
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.700]   "to everyone who believes."
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.960]   Now, we know that verse.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.800]   Many of you have memorized that verse.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.540]   But the question is, do you believe that?
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:45.460]   With all the causes that we give our life and money to,
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.520]   the most important cause for any Christian is this.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.780]   For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.420]   for it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.700]   The only way that a sinner can be saved
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.340]   from eternal damnation is the gospel,
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.920]   is the blood of Christ.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.340]   You can save this world.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.940]   You can feed all the poor.
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.320]   You can become a billionaire,
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.380]   donate all of it to help humanity.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.260]   And yet, if you do not preach the gospel,
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.740]   all you've done is put a Band-Aid on something
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.020]   that eventually is going to burn.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.400]   He says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.240]   "because it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.580]   "to everyone who believes."
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.060]   Do you believe that?
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.460]   Conviction of that truth is what gives us boldness,
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.660]   if you really believe that.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.040]   If you saw a child playing in the middle of a street,
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.840]   and you see a semi coming,
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   maybe the parents don't see it, so they feel safe,
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.920]   but you've seen it.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.180]   And you've been trying to tell the parents,
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.340]   but no one's listening.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:57.180]   At some point, because you know that danger is coming,
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.500]   you're gonna go into the middle of that road,
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.300]   tackle that child to the ground, grab him to safety.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.980]   You're not gonna sit there and say,
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:07.940]   "You know what, if I do this,
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.840]   "they're gonna think I'm a pedophile.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.360]   "What if the parents are looking at this,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.820]   "I'm tackling the child, how's this gonna look?"
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.340]   So, I'm just gonna tell them,
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.260]   but if they don't do something, then what can I do?
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.220]   Are you gonna just say, "Well, you know,"
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.520]   and just walk away?
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.340]   No, conviction.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:30.980]   Your conviction is going to dictate your action.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:36.700]   And if you are certain that this child is in danger,
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.860]   then I will do everything in my power to save that child,
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.160]   even if they will hate me for a bit,
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.460]   even if they will accuse me of being a sinner.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:50.180]   It is my conviction and the depth and the strength
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.140]   of my conviction that dictates my boldness.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.460]   Somebody who has weak faith,
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.420]   even being called weird is enough.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.700]   That guy's so weird, ah, the door's not open over there.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.140]   If I go to that country, you know,
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.200]   they don't have good food, door's shut.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.780]   The plane ride's too difficult, shut.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:23.560]   When we have weak faith, any little thing is a hindrance.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.240]   Or we're looking for somebody to, literally, right,
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.300]   to fall off a horse and say,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.520]   "What prevents me from being baptized?"
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.980]   Can you explain Isaiah 53, and you're praying,
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.800]   "Lord, can I meet another one like that?"
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.760]   And only when the red carpet is open,
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.740]   please now give me, I need to know how to get saved,
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.600]   who is this Jesus, and you're only in that context
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.860]   will you open your mouth.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.940]   But outside of that, it's like, ah, the door's not open.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.080]   When we have weak faith and we're not convicted,
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.620]   any little stumbling block, any little discomfort
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.820]   is enough to say the door's not open.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.460]   Conviction, secondly, is assurance of Christ's presence
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.180]   with us, assurance of Christ's presence.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.260]   I remember years ago, when I first started going out,
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.180]   street evangelism, I remember very specifically
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.780]   going out to Cerritos College.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.260]   And we would go and talk to people,
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.220]   and I would try to walk with people and share the gospel.
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.420]   And obviously, you know, majority of them are not,
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.020]   you know, were not friendly,
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.220]   but this was something that we were doing.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:32.100]   And I remember one morning, waking up and thinking,
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.860]   and just the thought of the anxiousness
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.920]   of just trying to stop people that I don't know
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.760]   and share the gospel with.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.120]   And, you know, most people, because you see me up here,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.880]   and they say, oh, Pastor Peter gets anxious.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.480]   It's like, this is easy.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.560]   Because I've been doing this for over 30 years,
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.680]   30, more than 30 years, like 36 years.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.320]   I've been standing in front of people preaching,
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.760]   so I don't get anxious about coming up here, right?
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.580]   I know public speaking is anxious for most people,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.480]   but this is easy.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.120]   But even now, if I go out in the streets
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.680]   and try to talk to a stranger, I was like,
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.080]   I don't want to be, I don't want people to be like,
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.760]   you weirdo, or get angry with me.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.780]   So I remember praying that morning and thinking,
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:11.920]   because I was in seminary,
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.320]   thinking, man, if Dr. Robert Saucy came with me,
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.120]   I would be so bold,
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.000]   because he was the top scholar at our school.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.400]   And I remember just being blown away in his classes.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.100]   I'm like, man, this guy really knows God,
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.360]   and he knows the word.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.080]   If I had Dr. Saucy with me, you know,
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.180]   I wouldn't hesitate if they asked me questions,
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.480]   and I could just turn around and say,
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.460]   what did he say, and you go get him.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.320]   And I remember praying that morning, being convicted.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.680]   He said, you're comforted with the thought
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.600]   of possibly another man be with you,
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.760]   but I told you I would be with you.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.160]   In the Great Commission, Matthew 28, 19 and 20,
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.960]   go therefore make disciples of all the nations,
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.200]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.040]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.880]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.900]   And lo, I am with you, even to the end of the age.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:03.720]   I am with you to the end of the age.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.080]   The reason why Jesus was saying this
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.560]   is because the disciples were afraid.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:12.400]   When Jesus told them that I'm going to the cross,
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.160]   they didn't fully understand, but they know now.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.960]   This is after the cross.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.320]   So they know now that if they follow Jesus,
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.600]   that they're gonna be scored, they're gonna be hated,
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   and some of them are gonna be crucified.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.340]   But he said, you be bold.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.880]   All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.280]   You do what I go tell you to do,
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.780]   because I am with you to the end of the age.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:42.760]   When we are assured of who he is in our life
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.040]   and his presence in our lives,
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.800]   it gives us the boldness to be able to preach.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.120]   You know, when we're young,
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.160]   no matter what situation we're in,
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.120]   as long as dad was with us,
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.560]   we can go through a dark alley,
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.940]   and we're afraid and dad holds our hands, that's enough.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.720]   We'll go through an area that we're unfamiliar with.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.220]   As long as dad is with us, we're okay, we're good.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:14.040]   This is the reason why Jesus says, I am with you.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.560]   Even though you may not physically see me,
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.240]   I will be with you.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.940]   I will not leave you as an orphan.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.060]   2 Timothy 1.12, for this reason,
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.700]   I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.300]   for I know whom I have believed.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.740]   I know whom I have, I am convinced that he is able
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:34.460]   to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.140]   Our boldness comes from knowing Christ,
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.880]   and that Christ is with us.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.300]   The reason why we are so timid is because
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.740]   sometimes we're not near him or we don't believe.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.220]   But the conviction of his presence in our lives
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.020]   automatically gives us boldness.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.340]   And finally, or third, walking in the spirit.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:03.120]   Boldness and the Holy Spirit go hand in hand.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.140]   Acts chapter 1.8, the disciples are ready to go.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.900]   Jesus promised that I'm gonna be with you,
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.220]   and then he says, but don't go yet.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.900]   But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.460]   has come upon you, and you shall be my witnesses,
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.540]   both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria,
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.540]   and even to the remotest part of the earth.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.740]   You notice what he says?
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:24.340]   You will be my witness when the Holy Spirit comes.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:29.260]   Not try to be a witness, not work and try to get
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.180]   the formula correct or get trained enough.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.900]   He says, no, when the Holy Spirit comes,
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.500]   you will be my witness.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.100]   And every instance in the book of Acts,
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.940]   when the Holy Spirit falls upon the disciples
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.880]   or the people, the very next text it says,
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.480]   they began to preach the word boldly.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.140]   So boldness and power is associated with the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.700]   That's why the Bible tells us to be filled
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.460]   with the spirit, 2 Timothy 1, 7 and 8.
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.260]   For God did not give us a spirit of timidity,
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.940]   but of power, of love and discipline.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.900]   Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.140]   of our Lord or of me, his prisoner,
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.900]   but join with me in suffering for the gospel
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.260]   according to the power of God.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.580]   In Ephesians 5, 18, do not get drunk with wine,
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.880]   for that is dissipation, but be filled with the spirit.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:18.060]   If we're not walking with the spirit,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.700]   automatically we become timid
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:24.420]   because the power comes from the Holy Spirit.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.700]   If we're not walking in the spirit,
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.620]   if we're not praying in the spirit,
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:31.460]   you automatically become timid.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.400]   This is a spiritual battle.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.380]   This is not because you have great learning
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.060]   or you have so much experience
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.940]   or you have some training that other people didn't have.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.360]   This is a spiritual battle.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.860]   Our battle is not against flesh and blood,
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.220]   but against powers and principalities in high places.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.440]   Therefore, put on the full armor of God.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:01.520]   Power comes from the Holy Spirit.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.900]   So if we're not walking in the spirit,
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.640]   if we're not filled with the spirit,
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.160]   you automatically will become timid.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.000]   Fourth and finally, what gives us boldness is love.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.000]   Love.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.180]   Hebrews 12, two to three, fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.380]   author and perfecter of faith,
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.180]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.320]   despising the shame and sat down at the right hand
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.380]   of the throne of God,
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.560]   for considering him who has endured such hostility
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.580]   by sinners against himself,
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.980]   so that you would not grow weary and lose heart.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:41.460]   Love gives you the boldness to do things
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.000]   that you would not normally do.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.820]   If you're a mom, it is not exclusive to moms,
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.980]   but I know that the moms have a special place
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.020]   in a child's life.
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:04:00.940]   Even the most timid moms become bold
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.580]   when it comes to their children.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.100]   They are willing to say and do things
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.980]   that they are not normally willing to do.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:10.820]   They don't sit there and say,
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.060]   "Ah, you know, I'm an introvert, so I can't say anything."
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.100]   All of a sudden, they become the most extroverted person
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.680]   you'll ever meet because of their love for their child.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.380]   Somebody who normally has no more than one thing to say,
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.580]   you know, and then they're exhausted,
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.020]   but all of a sudden, when it comes to their child,
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.700]   they become as bold as anybody else you've ever met.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.540]   What changed?
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.380]   Their love.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.360]   Their love.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.540]   You become more patient than you normally were,
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.180]   but you also become very bold.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:46.820]   If you think that your child is in danger,
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.700]   if you think that there's a bully,
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.140]   if you think that there's something in their path,
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.980]   all of a sudden, the mom becomes bold.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.540]   They're willing to give their life
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.460]   if it meant it's good for their child.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:03.020]   It's love.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:07.260]   It's God's love toward us and our love for him
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.360]   that gives us the boldness.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.700]   That's why Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 14 to 15,
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.920]   "For the love of Christ controls us,"
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.640]   in some of our translations, "compels us,
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.340]   "having concluded this, that one died for all,
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.220]   "therefore all died, and he died for all,
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.060]   "so that they who live might no longer live for themselves,
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:28.080]   "but for him who died and rose again on their behalf."
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.260]   He said, why does Paul do what he does?
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.700]   Why does he love people that are questioning him?
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.420]   Why does he endure not only to preach the gospel
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.140]   where the gospel was not preached,
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.800]   but put up with these people who are questioning him?
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.180]   And he's arguing with them, "I am an apostle!"
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.360]   He said, why does he endure?
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.580]   He says, "Love of Christ compels me.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.100]   "I am controlled by the love of Christ."
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:03.540]   You know, when Peter, right, we know him as the rock,
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.420]   but also as the denier to his face.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.740]   And so when Jesus wants to restore him
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.660]   after the resurrection, before he commissions him out,
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.240]   do you remember that scene in John 21?
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.980]   Because Peter's mistake was he was ashamed.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:25.180]   He was afraid, he was confused.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.180]   And he looked straight at Jesus and said, "I don't know him."
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.640]   No other disciple did that.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.300]   So Jesus wants to forgive him and restore him,
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.420]   but how does Jesus restore him?
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.420]   John chapter 21, Peter, "Do you love me more than these?"
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.900]   "Yes, Lord, I love you."
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.120]   Peter, "Do you love me more than these?"
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.780]   "Yes, Lord, I love you."
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.180]   Peter, "Do you really love me more than these?"
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.840]   "Lord, you know that I love you!"
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.100]   "If you really love me, then go feed my sheep."
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:08.940]   His shame was restored by acknowledging
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.900]   and confirming his love.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:17.960]   Love is what gives us boldness.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:24.460]   Love from God, love for God,
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:28.540]   which will overflow to the love for the world.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.620]   Part of the reason why we don't love the world
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.700]   that way may be because we don't love God that way.
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:45.660]   If you know the heart of God, you will know,
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:52.060]   you will know, in John 3:16, "For God so loved the world
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:56.740]   "that he gave his only begotten son,
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:00.240]   "that whosoever believes in him shall not perish,
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.880]   "but have everlasting life."
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.920]   That he loved the world to the degree
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.040]   that he would send his only begotten son.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:16.000]   So if you're near God, if you commune with God,
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.160]   if you abide with God, you cannot come away
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:26.840]   from his presence and not recognize his love for the world.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:33.400]   And you can't help begin to love what he loves.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:42.280]   It is our lack of love, not grace,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.640]   not mercy, not gentleness.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.720]   It's the lack of love for this fallen world
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.720]   that causes us to stay quiet.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.080]   We sing about glory.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.320]   We sing about the day he's going to come.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.080]   We sing about his love.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.740]   We celebrate his grace.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:10.360]   Knowing the rest of the world outside of this place
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.080]   is under the judgment of God.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.240]   And somehow we have made not telling them about this
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.820]   a normal practice in our churches.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:26.720]   There's so many weird things going on in this world.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.040]   Men calling themselves women.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.060]   Women calling themselves men.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:39.040]   Turning small children and then questioning
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.220]   their gender is hate speech.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.760]   There's so many weird things going on in this world.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.060]   But of all the weird things that I am the most concerned
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.280]   about, that I believe that God is most concerned about,
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.320]   is what the weirdness in the church.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:04.860]   How we have made keeping the gospel to ourselves normal.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:11.560]   It's normal to live all your life in the church
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.800]   and feel no sense of urgency to warn,
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.260]   to tell people about this good news.
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:24.920]   He says, "If you're gonna come after me,
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.680]   "you must also pick up your cross, follow me."
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.080]   He was ashamed of me before men.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.360]   I will be ashamed of him before my father
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.320]   when he comes in glory.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.840]   And let me finish my message
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.880]   'cause I wanna read this to you.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.880]   The most detailed record of early church fathers
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.600]   who were martyred for their faith is on Polycarp.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.200]   He was martyred in 158 AD and he was the bishop of Smyrna.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.080]   The reason why we have a detailed record of him
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.540]   is because he was so public.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:01.380]   And the people who watched it were so disturbed
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.200]   and inspired at the same time
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.240]   that they took record of the interaction.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.160]   So the Roman proconsul was watching this old man
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.840]   and was pleading with him.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.920]   All you have to do is say these words
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.200]   'cause he didn't want to kill him.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.560]   So this is the interaction.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.260]   The proconsul urged him harder,
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.240]   "Take the oath and I'll let you go.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.540]   "Curse Christ."
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.920]   Polycarp says, "86 years I have served him
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.460]   "and he never did me wrong.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.080]   "How can I blaspheme my king who saved me?"
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.740]   The proconsul says, "I have wild animals.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.400]   "I'll throw you to them unless you change your mind."
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.520]   Polycarp replied, "Call them in
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.960]   "for we are not allowed to change
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.400]   "from something better to something worse."
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.460]   The proconsul says, "Scorn the wild beasts
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.800]   "and I'll have you burned alive
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.460]   "if you don't change your mind."
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.820]   Polycarp, before he is martyred said,
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.620]   "You threaten with fire that burns for a short time
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.480]   "and is soon quenched.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.620]   "You don't know about the fire of the coming judgment
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.660]   "and eternal punishment that awaits the wicked.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.380]   "But why are you waiting?
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.620]   "Come do what you will."
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.780]   And reluctantly the proconsul lit the fire.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.960]   And he was burned alive.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.620]   I remember reading this back in college.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.580]   So moved by this man's faith.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:34.880]   I probably was no more than 22, 23 at the time
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.720]   and I remember reading this thinking,
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.300]   "If the Lord allows me to live this long,
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.200]   "I pray that one day
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.600]   "that I would have the love for Christ like this man.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.280]   "That I would know the love of Christ to this degree
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.240]   "that I would be willing, even at my death,
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.420]   "that the only concern that I have,
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.240]   "that whether by life or death,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.640]   "that I would not be ashamed.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.300]   "I pray that we would come to know this Christ.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.640]   "Don't just admire him from a distance.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.420]   "Deny yourself, pick up your cross
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   "and let's follow him together."
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.260]   Let's pray.
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:26.260]   Father,
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:30.020]   you are worthy of our praise.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.780]   You're worthy of our lives.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.340]   Help us, Lord God, live lives
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.060]   as your ambassador.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:44.860]   That we may be the light that you've called us to be.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.940]   May your name be magnified in us and through us.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.620]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:54.100]   Our praise team is going to lead us
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.940]   in a time of communion song
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:57.940]   and as we open up the communion table,
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.500]   we ask that again, one by one, when you are ready to come,
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.220]   if you're coming down this line here, there's two lines.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.220]   So as you're coming and if you see the line merging,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.820]   something has gone wrong, so please stay in that line.
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.460]   So for the sake of time, we need both lines to go.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.340]   So please come this way and then exit the side.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.540]   If you are gluten-free, the gluten-free stuff
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.580]   is on my right to your left.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.920]   So please go to that side if you need gluten-free stuff.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.640]   And the communion table is a celebration
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.100]   of what has already happened to us.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.500]   That Christ died for us and he washed our sins away.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.300]   We don't come here by our own merit.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.880]   We don't come here because we had a good week in the Lord.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.700]   We come here because we're reminded
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.920]   that only by the blood of Christ that we can have salvation.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.640]   So we come to celebrate, we come in repentance,
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.840]   we come reflecting, and so after we open up the table,
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.080]   we ask that you, when you are ready,
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.680]   come and participate in the communion table.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.480]   So if you're not a baptized believer in the church
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.980]   and you're just here, maybe as a guest 'cause you have,
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.640]   you're just curious about the Christian faith,
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.960]   we ask that you would stay where you're at.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.080]   There is no power in and of itself.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.080]   And so we ask that you would just stay where you're at
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.400]   and just be honest before God.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.680]   Lord, if you're real, if the gospel that I've been taught
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.400]   by my friends and maybe some things that was said today
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.040]   is making me curious and I want to know you,
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.040]   there's no formula.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.080]   You don't have to go ask me.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.960]   Just come before God in an honest prayer.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.640]   Lord, if you're real, if the gospel that I heard is real,
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.420]   open my eyes that I may also see you.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.600]   I want to be forgiven.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.040]   I want a new life in Christ.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.800]   And just offer an honest prayer before God,
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.020]   asking the Lord to answer your prayers.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.360]   Otherwise, we ask that whenever you're ready,
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.720]   one by one, you would come.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.880]   For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.780]   to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.960]   in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.480]   When he had given things, he broke it and said,
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.840]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.320]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
