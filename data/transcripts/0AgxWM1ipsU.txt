[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   [Intro]
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.640]   We close out the week with an email from a podcast listener named Ashley who writes in
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.080]   to ask this, "Dear Pastor John, as parents of two young children, my husband and I find
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.380]   ourselves regularly battling the popular idea that the job of grandparents is to spoil their
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.060]   grandchildren.
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.360]   We are seeking to raise our kids in the fear and admonition of the Lord, but it is hard
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.560]   when our ideas are subverted by the way our parents believe they are loving their grandchildren.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.840]   Any advice on how to approach this with them respectfully?"
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.480]   Thank you so much for your podcast and your ministry.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.040]   They have been instrumental in our walk with Christ.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.920]   What would you say to Ashley?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.240]   One of the built-in problems in America, at least, is that many grandparents have more
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:01:01.440]   money usually than they have geographic presence or energy to spend with their grandchildren.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.240]   Therefore they tend to make up for the guilt feelings of not being near or having energy
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.000]   by giving them more stuff and more expensive stuff.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.800]   So the first thing I would say is to the grandparents listening, I know the feeling.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.040]   I've got 12 grandchildren.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.800]   I know the feeling of having the resources and wanting to give good things to your grandchildren.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:43.280]   But if you're a Christian, keep in mind that having things, things, and giving things as
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.240]   opposed to having relationships and giving yourself are not always the best way to love.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.280]   This takes some serious thought and creative research to discover the kinds of gifts that
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.320]   might really bless the whole family in significant spiritual or educational or recreational ways.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.800]   And under God, the most important people to interact with when thinking these things through
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   is the parents of your grandchildren.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.480]   They're called your kids.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:30.360]   We grandparents should put out of our mind once and for all the thought that going around
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.920]   our children to get to our grandchildren is right.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   It's not right.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.840]   We have no right to do that.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.400]   Those children are told by God to be responsive, to be obedient to their parents.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.600]   Their obedience and responsiveness is to us secondarily and derivatively.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.280]   And what that means for us grandparents is that we defer to the parents of our grandchildren,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.760]   which means we defer to our children.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   That may sound contrary to what we ordinarily have thought about our children and how to
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.160]   relate to them and they to us, but it is built in.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.640]   I'm arguing it's built into the biblical pattern of children obeying their parents.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.000]   Once there is a new unit formed of parents and children, the parents of those parents
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.560]   assume a secondary role in the authority and leadership toward those children, which means
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.200]   that we should consult those parents and we should be willing to listen to them if they
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.960]   say that the gifts we are giving are proving to be unhelpful in the way they're trying
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.760]   to parent their kids.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.180]   And I know this may be painful relationally.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.720]   The older we are, the more humble we should be and the thicker our skin should be.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.120]   We've been knocked about by life more times and we should have some calluses on our skin
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.320]   so that we don't mope and act immature and self-pitying because our kids have to tell
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.840]   us that our gifts aren't helping.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.800]   Back to the question she asked.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.520]   She wants to know what she should do towards grandparents, and I'm talking to grandparents
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.480]   and she didn't even ask me to talk to grandparents, but I felt like I needed to.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   So how do the parents of the grandchildren approach the grandparents if those grandparents
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.080]   are doing things or giving things that the parents find unhelpful?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.360]   And here's the first thing I would say, and it's kind of a general principle I would say
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.120]   about lots of relationships, marriage, friendships.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:07.880]   Don't try to give corrective advice to others, in this case to your parents, in the very
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.880]   moment of disagreement.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.100]   So for example, if it's Christmas or a birthday and the kids just opened the gift from grandmama
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.580]   and you find that gift really inappropriate, that's not the time to deal with it.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.400]   Don't deal with it then.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.440]   The principle is find a neutral time at some distance from the moment of disagreement,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.480]   perhaps over lunch, and gently ask if we can talk about something important and then be
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.240]   as affirming as you can to the motives and to the love that they're trying to express
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.920]   so that that doesn't feel minimized or discounted, and then explain to them to the best of your
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   ability why you think things should be different than they are.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.920]   And it would be helpful if you had thought through—I'm saying this as a granddad—it
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.400]   would be helpful if you had thought through some alternative suggestions for your parents
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.920]   because we grandparents aren't always as wise and creative as we need to be in this
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   regard.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:24.400]   And if you can think of things that would bless your children from your parents, we
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.040]   would, I hope, be willing to hear.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.880]   But I can't end, Tony, without another word to grandparents because of that phrase, "Spoil
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   your grandkids."
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.320]   It is emphatically not our job to spoil our grandchildren.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   That's not funny.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.240]   It's not funny.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   It's not our place to be lenient where the parents are strict.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:03.120]   It is emphatically our role to reinforce with happy unity the parenting that our kids are
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.960]   trying to give their kids, our grandkids, assuming, of course, that it's safe and
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.820]   wholesome.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.900]   There should be a united front—this would be beautiful—there should be a united front
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.280]   of biblical principle that the kids discern in parents and grandparents.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.640]   They should see it as a tradition.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.360]   There's a legacy here.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.440]   These standards are coming down from generation to generation.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.600]   I'm going to embrace them and use them someday.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:41.560]   So let's be done with the notion that grandparents should spoil their grandkids.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.380]   We shouldn't.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:50.460]   We should bless them in every possible spiritual way that we can and shouldn't let material
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.960]   gifts get in the way of that goal.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.560]   That is very helpful and eternally strategic perspective.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.240]   Well, it is time for us to break for the weekend.
