[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Testing, testing.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Alex Lee, can you hear me?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.500]   Ah, ah.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500]   Alex Koh, can you hear me?
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000]   OK.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Jamie Sabandi, can you hear me?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Oh, great.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   All right.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   get the teaching portion started.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Father, there is so much in here.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   My fear is that it's going to be misrepresented.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And so I pray that you would just guide and guard my lips
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   so that your truths would just be indelibly
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   etched onto our minds and our hearts
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   so that we would apply appropriately.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And so we pray for good feeding at this time
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and that you would just align our hearts toward your word
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   and help us, Lord God, to both be in terror of your word
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   but also to be so delighted by it
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   that we coming back to this well for more.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Thank you for the opportunity to just fellowship together
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   through your word.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We ask for your help to have ears that genuinely will hear.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And Lord, open up our eyes to see the beautiful things
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   in your law.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So as I mentioned last week, the flow of Galatians,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   there's three sections of it.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And in almost every section, Paul is upset.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I want to show you this.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And he's pretty sarcastic, it feels like, in English.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So in Galatians 1.6, we're looking at him just appalled.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And then in chapter 3, he goes, "You foolish Galatians,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   "you dummies, who has bewitched you before whose eyes
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   "Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   "Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   "are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And then in chapter 5, just to make sure that they're not
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   forgetting that he's still appalled at how they could switch.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   "You were running well, who hindered you
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   "from obeying the truth?"
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So everything that Paul is saying, it's almost like a passive
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   drifting into this.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's like they're being tricked, they're being obstructed,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   they're being hindered, and they are choosing, it appears,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   a different means to salvation.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So there is a general tone of dismay that we're going to hit
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   just in a couple months, and then in 2024 as well,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   because we study Galatians for a while.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And so what's the desertion?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   What's the problem?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Without fully understanding the specifics,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   here we have an insight into this.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   "You have been severed from Christ."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That pops up into my head a bunch of different questions.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Did they lose their salvation? Are they apostate?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   If they are apostate, how were they called by the grace of Christ?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So I have all these questions already, but I'm not going to go into that
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   until we get to chapter 5, and then we'll let Pastor Mark deal with this in February.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So, "You've been severed from Christ,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   you who are seeking," and that's a very strong word,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   "to be justified by law.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   You have fallen from grace."
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So this is a problem.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   They have been seeking to be justified by man's efforts
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   to live according to the law, and they've somehow fallen from grace.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So this is the problem, and we can't unpack everything that this means,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   but here's the problem.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And we looked at this last week.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   What is the gospel?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's basically news that sinful man can get with holy God.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Basic definition, and I'm sure you guys wouldn't disagree with it.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You might articulate it differently, but that's what it is, right?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Holy, holy, holy God, we can have reconciliation.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   There is a way, and it's extremely exclusive.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   If the Bible is the word of God, and there is only one way prescribed in it,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   it is what it is.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's exclusive.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And this is what Paul Walsh says.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   The true gospel is radically exclusive.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Jesus is not a way.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   He is the way, and all other ways are no way at all.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   He sounds like a Paul, because he is.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But that's, in essence, what we believe.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   If you don't believe it, that means you actually are holding to a different faith altogether.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But that's what the Bible teaches.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   There is only one way, and that one way is very specific, and that one way is very exact.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, even in modern-day contexts, there's going to be a distortion of the gospel.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's not going to be a complete doing away with, right?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Most heresies contain 90-plus percent truth.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Because if it was blatantly erroneous, no one would believe it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But most heretical teachings have a form of truth, but just a twisting of or distorting of its elements.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And why is that the case?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   My question for this passage is, did the Galatians realize that they had deserted?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   They probably did not.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So Paul is just having this very visceral reaction,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   but the Galatians probably are like, "What's the big deal? What are you--what?"
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Because the distortion, they didn't catch.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Okay?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So we have to get this right, but we have an adversary that wants us to get it wrong,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   not in whole, but just enough to cause you to be holding on to a different gospel.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So John 8, 43, it describes a little bit of our adversary working through human means.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Okay?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   This is Jesus. "Why do you not understand what I am saying?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It is because, Pharisees, you cannot hear my word."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And remember, these are religious people.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   For Satan, he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And that's Jesus to the Pharisees.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And here's an example in Genesis 3, verse 4.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   This is one of the first things out of his mouth to the woman.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "The serpent said, 'You surely will not die.'"
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Not only did Eve die, she caused death to be part of every woman, every man, for forever.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Right? Okay?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So Satan uses corrupt, distorted man to propagate lies.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   He's always done that.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And so this agency of man is a very important topic, especially in chapter 1.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Okay?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And I want to highlight some of the verses that we're touching upon either this week or next.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Paul, an apostle, not sent from men, nor through the agency of man.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Verse 9 through 10.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   "If any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you receive, he is to be accursed.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Or am I striving to please men?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Continuing, "For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And later on, Paul says, "I did not immediately consult with man, flesh and blood."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Okay?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So, Paul is basically pointing to a fact that there is God's way,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   and there is a corrupt, polluted, perverted way that man tries to hold on to to access God.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And that is not God's prescribed way.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Okay?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And I want to emotionally help us feel this by walking you through a very familiar illustration.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I bring this up at least once a semester because I love this.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Not the mosquito, I love the image that we can kind of think through.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Okay?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   What's on the left?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Who has one as a pet?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Kylie. Okay, she's--that's weird. Okay?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Does--do you know anybody that has compassion on the mosquito?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Anybody?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   If I were to see a mosquito here and go, "Bah!" in front of all of you,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   would any of you report me to the authorities?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   No.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Why? Because this mosquito has no worth.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Right?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   If anything, it's a negative thing.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   If we were living in an area with malaria, dengue, and Zika,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   you would applaud me for doing this.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   True or false?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   If I said, "Guys, there are mosquitoes in here, and they have dengue, malaria, and Zika.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Before we start Bible study, let's hunt and kill as many as we can."
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You guys would not disagree. You guys actually would join the hunt.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   True or false?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   True.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   If we saw--they're called pupas, all right?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   This floor covered with pupas, these mosquito larvae,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   that are going to grow up to be bloodsuckers.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I took a blowtorch, and I just went, "Hhh!"
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Would you guys applaud that, or would you hate me for it?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   You would applaud it.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   No one in their right mind would catch and release the mosquito.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Right?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   You're like, "But I love all living things. Everything that's been created by the Lord is beautiful.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It has value. Pastor Peter, here, let me grab it.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Let me let it go."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Nobody would do that.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   If you did that, people would turn on you.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But what grace is, is you're not only catching the mosquito,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and you're not killing it,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   you're going to adopt it as your child.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Treat it like an equal to your kid, if you're a parent.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You're going to let it sleep in your house,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   in its own room, with its own inheritance.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You might give it a rat as a buffet. Whatever it is.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   You will open up an account, which seems absurd,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and save your 529 for this little thing.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   That is grace.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Now, here's my question. You guys have heard all of this up to this point before.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   What can a mosquito do
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   to ever convince you not to kill it?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Let's say it comes up to you and lands on your hand,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and does a little bit of, like, "Hello!"
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Would that convince you not to kill it?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Would four mosquitoes landing,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and they make a little letter saying,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   "Peace be with you," in little words,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   would that prevent you from killing it?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   What if it landed on you,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   and looked up with its needle nose,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and said, "Hi!"
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Would that arouse compassion in you?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Would any behavior of the mosquito
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   ever cause you not to kill it?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   No!
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   It would be absolutely absurd of you
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   to entertain the thought
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   that, "Oh, just because it did a little dance."
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Or, "What if it brings you a little cauliflower?"
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Not a cauliflower. The dandelion.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   "What if it brings you a flower?"
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Would you kill it still?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And you wouldn't think of it at all.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   But here's the problem with sinful man.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Satan has convinced sinful man
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   that the distance between me and God
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   is way closer than the distance
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   between me and the mosquito.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Sinful man believes that I have more in common
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   with God than I do to this mosquito.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Are you guys tracking?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The chasm between me and God
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   is exponentially greater than me and this mosquito.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   So for sinful man to say,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   "I can do something to curry favor
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   with holy, holy, holy God,"
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   is an offense.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   What God did in the history of humanity
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   is He took this whole floor
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   is covered with mosquitoes.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   He decided to take a corner and call it His own.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Absurd.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And He didn't just choose not to wipe out
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   that little corner of mosquitoes.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   He chose to call them His own.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   "I will be like a mother to you."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   What?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Does He have a right to choose
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   what section of the room of pupa
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   that He wants to preserve?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Absolutely. He is God.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   What about all these other mosquitoes saying,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   "How? What? That's not fair.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   That makes no sense.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Every single one should just be blowtorched out
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and no one would bat an eye."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   But for some reason, our God chooses to have compassion
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   on this little corner
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and to preserve away.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   The gospel message is that
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   God provided a way back to Him
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   and that is an absurdity
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   to where all the holy angels in heaven are like,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "What is going on?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   This makes zero sense."
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And for man to be like, "Well, yeah, we did it.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   We earned it.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   We were beautiful. We were worthy."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   is absolute blasphemy.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Are you guys emotionally not tracking along?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Okay.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Ephesians 2, 3, 4,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "Among them, we too all formerly lived
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   in the lusts of our flesh,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and we were by nature spawn of wrath."
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   We were the objects designed to be
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   wrath laden.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Created just for wrath.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   But God being rich in mercy.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And that is an infinitely, wonderfully beautiful but.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Because that changes everything.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   But God who is absurdly rich in mercy
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   because of His great love,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   with which He loved us,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and then later He saves us,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   not because of any beautiful work we did,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   but by His grace.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   For what?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Verse 10 of Ephesians 2.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Good works.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   He saved us.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   He predestined us.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   He called us.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   He elected us.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He will change us.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   He will glorify us.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   He will beautify us.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   All we do is in faith say,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "Thank you. Praise God.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   All glory be to you because none of this is me."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Spurgeon said,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   "Giving your heart to Christ is not the gospel."
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Salvation comes from something that Christ gives you.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Not something that you give to Christ.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And Martin Luther, this turned into a hymn.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   "Did we in our own strength confide
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   our striving would be losing?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Were not the right man on our side
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the man of God's own choosing?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Dost ask who that may be?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Christ Jesus it is He.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Lord Sabaoth His name
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   from age to age His name
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   and He must win the battle."
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I mean, unfortunately, the music is kind of strange.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   This hymn, right?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   "Almighty fortress is our God."
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   That's why it's not as popularly sung.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   But this is such a beautiful hymn.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   A bulwark never failing.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Now, I want you to look at something.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   God does it all.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Okay?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   So this is a preview of salvation.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   "For I will take you from the nations.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I will gather you from all the lands.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I will bring you into your own land.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I will sprinkle clean water on you
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and you will be clean.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I will cleanse you from all your filthiness
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and from all your idols.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I will give you a new heart
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and put a new spirit within you.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   and I will give you a heart of flesh.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I will put my spirit within you.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I will cause you to walk in my statues
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and you will be careful to observe my ordinances.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   so you will be my people and I will be your God."
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   How many I wills are in here?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   A bunch.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Salvation is not of man.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Salvation is not man's effort in any way, shape, or form.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   It is 100% God's grace, God's kindness.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You guys understand?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Okay?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   God has done a spiritual heart transplant in you
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   if you are a child of God.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It cannot be reversed.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It cannot be undone.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   This is not something that you made an effort to have.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   You did not change your heart.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   God did it.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   You are not a creator.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   He is creator and you are creation, but you're new.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   he is a new creature.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   The old things have passed away.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Behold, new things have come.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   For neither is circumcision anything,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   So new creations will look like new creations.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   They will not indulge the same things of yesteryear.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   They're brand new.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   There will be works,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   but salvation is not from these works.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's a byproduct.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Okay?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   But sometimes in our folly,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   we want to manipulate details of our lives
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   to prove to God, to prove to others
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   that we can save ourselves,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   that we can improve our lot,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   that we can make ourselves more beautiful to God
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   than that person.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Folly.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   So what is the gospel?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   How are we saved?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Grace through faith plus nothing else.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   But when God grabs your heart and changes it,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   will there be results, yes or no?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Yes.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Okay?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And this is going to be the tension in the book of Galatians.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Where does works play into my salvation?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Right?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Nod your heads if you know that there is that tension coming.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Okay?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The Bible, sorry, parking announcements.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   So that's the teaching portion.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   The mosquito illustration.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Greater distance between me and God
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   or me and the mosquito?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Between me and God.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   There's nothing, just as much as there's nothing
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   a mosquito can do to convince me not just not to kill it,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   but to adopt it as my child.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Even more so, infinitesimally more so,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   there's nothing that you can do to please God
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   in your own efforts.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It has to be completely His grace.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And that's why we give praise.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Because we serve a very strange God who would do such a thing.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Imagine if Kylie did take home a mosquito
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   and give it a name
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and put makeup on it and stuff.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   That's nothing compared to what God did to Jesus on the cross
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   for our sin.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   You guys follow?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Okay?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Some announcements that I'm going to repeat a little bit.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   We have a lot of people here.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   So men, oh, he didn't announce it on Facebook today,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   so maybe we could sneak into the parking spot.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   No, please don't do that.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Save the closer spots for our ladies.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And then, you know, and you guys will walk a little bit farther.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Okay?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Same thing, no parking on Wednesdays over here
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   or on the street.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And if you get here before 5, don't park in our neighbor's lots.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   But here's a very important announcement for parking.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   You heard it on Sunday from Pastor Peter.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   The Kimco lot here, okay,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and then this cafe building lot here,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   we are going to designate it on Sundays
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   for families with small children only.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Part of it is we do not want our kids crossing the street at all.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Not just as you would understand why.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And even if you're driving 15 miles an hour,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   a kid can just dart in.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   All it takes is one bad incident,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and we have a lot of kids now running around there,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and we're trying to remedy this thing.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   But for now, if you guys are able,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   don't park here so that we can have the kids not have to ever cross the street
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   because that's by all means avoidable.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Cool? Okay?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And just because there aren't people like watching you,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   you know God is always watching.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Okay?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   So please do.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And then, if you are a parent,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   one of the things is we have a lot of kids
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   jumping across the little AstroTurf hill
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and playing on the sidewalk.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Please watch your kid, okay, if you are a parent.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   We are going to try to figure out ways
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   where your kids can play in a safer area.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   But for the time being, I know you love to talk to people,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   but watch your kid first.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   That's one that we do have a request for.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Men, we're having a workshop.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Ignore the galbijjim part.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   We're having a workshop where we're going to be spiritually fed
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   with spiritual meat.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And then we're going to learn how to share spiritual meat with one another
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   through the topic of accountability.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And then, if you want to donate $10 for the real meat,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I mean, not the real meat, like cow meat,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   then we'll have that for lunch.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   But today is the last day to sign up.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And then I'm putting the groups together with Pastor Peter tomorrow morning.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   So if you want, you can do this right now if you haven't signed up already.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And if you haven't paid, please remember to pay.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Someone told me to announce something that I completely now don't remember what it was.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Who told me to announce something?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Alex, what was it that you wanted me to announce?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   For babysitting and for facility prep and cleanup.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Yes.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   So we do need a lot of help setting the tables up,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   setting the chairs up for Bible study.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So there is a sign-up sheet that all the small--actually, you should have access to.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's that first email that you got.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Please sign up to help with something if you can.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   We need help babysitting because we do have a lot of parents who are actually here on site right now with their kids.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   But in order to alleviate some of the burdens of them missing so much of the Bible study to watch the kids,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   it would help for all of us to kind of go around and watch the kids.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   So if you can do that, please sign up for that.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And there's other things you can sign up for on that initial email that you received.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Okay?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   So here's a couple of prep questions for next week.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Read and prepare 11 to 17.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   The following weeks is going to feel a lot shorter, but the break was at verse 17.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   So this one is going to feel a lot more wordy, but content-wise it's not a lot.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   So 11 to 17, and one thing that you want to keep in mind as you're preparing is what does Paul's conversion--
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   and this is his longest autobiography, this whole section.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   In the whole of Scriptures, this is the most he writes about himself.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   What does Paul's conversion reveal about the gospel of Christ?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And then what role did Paul play in his own salvation?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I kind of gave it away with the mosquito illustration, but try to discern that from the text.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Okay?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   And I'm going to post these up on Facebook either tonight or tomorrow morning with the verses.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   This is your group's discussion.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Do you tend to wrestle more with legalism or antinomianism?
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   If you don't know what antinomianism means, just think of it as like just, you know,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   one saved, always saved, whatever I do doesn't affect anything.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   It's like no law in my life.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Okay?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   So which way does your pendulum swing?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And what are the potential errors in your understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Okay?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Second, do you struggle with the assurance of salvation?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Through Galatians, it could be a genuine question like, "Did I get here by my effort, or did God save me?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   How do I know?"
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   If so, what are the things that cause that struggle?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And then how do you help someone who is struggling with doubt?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Remember, if you get the gospel wrong, I'm not going to say that, okay?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So how do you help someone struggling with doubt?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Do you give them false hope?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Okay?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   How do you help?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And then how do you make sure you do not compromise the gospel in your efforts to help him or her?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And then lastly, in what ways can your group members help you grow in becoming a better bond servant of Christ?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   All right, let me pray.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Father, we thank you for just reminding us afresh that you are holy and that you are beyond our comprehension.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And it is very strange that you would be such a God of grace and kindness and mercy and compassion.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And I pray that as we reflect on it, cause us to be in awe, wonder, and reverence.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And in response, Lord, help us to fall down in adoration and worship.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And in application, help us to grow to have the same compassion for those around us.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   So Lord, would you empower us to preach the good news of Christ, even if it is foolishness, to those who are perishing?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Because there are many who you will save through your gospel truth.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   So we pray, Father, for your help that we would feed well off of these truths and apply it powerfully in our lives.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   For your glory and for our joy.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   And pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
