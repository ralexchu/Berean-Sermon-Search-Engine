[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.240]   If you would take your Bibles please and head over to Leviticus Chapter 20.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.320]   Okay.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:33.560]   I'm just going to read the first portion of it, Leviticus Chapter 20 verses 1 through
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.560]   5.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.920]   And the Word of God says, "Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, 'You shall say to the
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320]   sons of Israel, 'Any man from the sons of Israel or from the alien sojourning in Israel
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   who gives any of his offspring to Molech shall surely be put to death.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.640]   The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.160]   I will also set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.200]   he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile my sanctuary and to profane
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.400]   my holy name.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.140]   If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.320]   of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death, then I myself will set my face
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.800]   against that man and against his family.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.400]   I will cut him off from among their people, both him and all those who play harlot after
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.580]   him by playing the harlot after Molech.'"
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.360]   So today we're in our continuing study of Leviticus and at Chapter 20 there is an incredible
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.560]   like intensity of the tone as we start this chapter.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.440]   By way of quick review, in Leviticus Chapter 18, much of the command was concerning the
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.700]   holiness of the people and God going over various sexual perversions, calling the people
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.600]   to purity, to abstain from everything from the list of incest, homosexuality, bestiality,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.680]   and all the other types of sexual perversions there were.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.480]   And then in Chapter 19, which was the last time, we talked about a holiness that perhaps
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.160]   we might not be readily thinking about.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.400]   We talked about the holiness that really comes from personal and national moral qualities,
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.920]   namely to have actual mercy, to have a kind of characteristic where you care beyond yourself
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.400]   but you're actually seeking the benefit of the people around you, being both equitable,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.680]   kind and merciful.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   In Chapter 20, what's really interesting is that most of the sins or most of the prohibitions
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.160]   that you see in this chapter were already seen in Chapter 18, 19.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.640]   It's just that it's actually reiterating them with the emphasis on the consequences, on
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   the punishments for those sins.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.480]   And that's why already as you notice when we read, there was an incredible intensity
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   to the section where God says, "You must execute judgment on this individual.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   If you do not, I will."
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.480]   It's pretty intense, amazingly intense.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.120]   So as you take a look at this first section, we look at this first verse or first section
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.320]   of the passage that we're studying and there's a lot going on there.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.460]   So I'm going to read it for us one more time.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.440]   It says again, "But the Lord spoke to Moses saying, 'You shall also say to the sons of
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.260]   Israel, 'Any man from the sons of Israel or from the alien sojourning in Israel who gives
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.080]   any of his offering to Molech shall surely be put to death.'"
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.880]   And we're going to notice that that phrase has appeared many times.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.800]   "The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.680]   I will also set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.560]   he has given some of his offering to Molech so as to defile my sanctuary, to profane my
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.880]   holy name.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.100]   If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.480]   of his offering to Molech so as not to put him to death, then I myself will set my face
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.280]   against that man and against his family and will cut him off from among their people,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.160]   both him and all those who play the harlot after him."
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.480]   They're playing the harlot after Molech.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   Okay?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.960]   The reason why I read that again is because that pattern of defining the sin and then
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.360]   requiring the community of God to recognize it and actually carry out the judgment and
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   then really giving the warning of what that would entail for the community is then now
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.280]   going to be repeated through the rest of the chapter.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.800]   So here are first several observations.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.680]   So what we notice is that infant sacrifice and idol worship was heinous in the eyes of
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.760]   God and must be punished.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.920]   The blank there for you is simply "must be punished."
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.680]   The idea and running theme of the chapter emphasizes this necessity of judgment, okay?
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.800]   That is absolutely necessary.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.880]   Now this kind of thing is not something brand new to us, but there's such a crucial emphasis
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.540]   seen in the chapter.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.480]   What I mean by that is that phrase "must surely be put to death" and that theme is repeated
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.680]   11 times in this section.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.800]   What's more, there is that accentuation of the need and necessity for judgment.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   Why?
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.080]   Because he says, "Oh, you know what?
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   That's what happened.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   My fault."
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   Okay?
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.240]   It's because he says that if the community does not, you know, have concern for this
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.920]   man but rather is in neglect and they do not carry out the judgment, then God Himself
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.200]   would perform that judgment on him and his whole family.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.560]   Right?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   So then it now gets even worse because the judgment is beyond just that one individual.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.300]   And so there is something, again, really interesting about that because then that means the burden
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.240]   of the sin is actually shared by the family who are presumably in the closest proximity
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.920]   to be able to turn the culprit around.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   Right?
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.880]   There's already just an assumption that the individuals who are going to be sharing
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.600]   the responsibility for that person to turn around is actually the family.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.440]   I do believe this is actually in tune with the New Testament, is it not?
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.720]   That those of you who are spiritual, those of you who are close, those of you who are
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   more mature in the faith, that you should first give attention to yourself and then
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.120]   seek, pursue to turn an individual around from their sin.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.200]   And that we have that concept here.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.280]   Now, we have to say definitely there's a caveat, right?
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.240]   Here it's not talking about just turning that person around.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.760]   What's emphatic is here it is the responsibility of the community to execute the individual,
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.960]   to take stones in their hands and to throw it to crush the person to death.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.120]   I mean, just take a moment to think about how intense that is.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.680]   And if you were receiving these words from a scary mountain, because the context is they're
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   at Mount Sinai, okay?
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.720]   The mountain was on fire, it was covered in smoke, it was like a volcano, there was thunder
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.200]   and lightning and God spoke from the mountain, gave words through Moses to the people.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   And he says, "Because of certain sins, there's going to be death and I want you to carry
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   it out."
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.320]   Now, obviously God is not calling us to like vigilante ministry where it's our job to go
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.960]   slap the guy or punish the guy who's sinning, right?
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.000]   That's obviously not the case.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.920]   The New Testament teaches us that vengeance is in God's hands, that the anger of man does
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.080]   not accomplish the righteousness of God.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.000]   However, what's very clear is God does expect the community to be able to discern what is
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.800]   right, what is wrong, and then to be able to enforce it within their own community.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:27.080]   And so, the next point is, sorry, he places the responsibility, okay?
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.200]   He places the responsibility of punishing any man guilty of infant sacrifice or adultery
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.720]   upon the hands of the people while he still enacts his own judgment as well.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.500]   In this section, God says, "The people of the land shall stone him."
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.960]   God could have instantaneously and immediately, miraculously judged the individual by taking
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.880]   away his breath, but he says he wants the community to do it.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.440]   But what's more, he says that he too will enact that judgment by saying he's going to
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.040]   set his face against him.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.120]   Here's an interesting passage from a previous section of Leviticus, Leviticus chapter 18.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.280]   God clearly said and taught the nation, "You are to perform my judgments and keep my statues
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.960]   to live in accordance with them.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.080]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:26.720]   So here's a moment for us to pause and to think about this, that for us in our Christian
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.840]   maturity, God does absolutely expect every single one of us as a believer to have that
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.920]   moral standard according to and accurately to God's standard.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.000]   And it is for us, by the renewing of our minds to exercise the discretion.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.280]   Is this pleasing to God, yes or no?
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.240]   And then God has taught us, "You speak the truth in love."
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.400]   And then God has taught us, "You go to restore the individual."
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   And so here's another passage for you from Herod's chapter 5 verse 14 that talks about
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.500]   maturity, "But solid food is for the mature who because of practice have their senses
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.480]   trained to discern good and evil."
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:19.140]   That we have to have both our assessment of certain circumstances, the actions of ourselves
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.720]   and of the people around us to be able to have that discretion.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.960]   Is this wise according to the eyes of God?
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.460]   And your responsibility is all the more implicit in this passage because what you notice is
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:40.900]   that this chapter as you read it is not written to would-be or potential sinners like chapter
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.900]   18.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.860]   What I mean is chapter 18 is like, "No, you shall not do this."
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.860]   But here he's talking to the community.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.020]   Such a person must die.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.140]   That's a very different audience.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.300]   Chapter 18 is like, "You need to be pure.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.820]   You cannot cross these family boundaries.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.180]   You cannot cross these polygamy boundaries."
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:10.060]   But here it's more so that individual needs to be judged so that there be no sin in your
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060]   midst.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.700]   It's a really interesting thought.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.420]   And this very much correlates to what we find in the New Testament when it comes to 1 Corinthians
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.420]   chapter 5.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.340]   It's a lengthy passage but I'd like us to read it together so please turn there in your
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.340]   Bibles.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.780]   1 Corinthians chapter 5.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.060]   Okay.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.060]   So I don't have it on the screen but please look on your Bibles.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.740]   And I'm going to start reading from verse 1 so please listen and follow along.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.820]   It says, "It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, an immorality of
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:53.260]   such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles that someone has his father's wife.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:12:01.300]   You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead so that the one who had done this
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.220]   deed would be removed from your midst.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.700]   For I on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.100]   who has committed this as though I were present.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.580]   In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled and I wish you in the spirit with
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.940]   the power of the Lord Jesus, I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.620]   of his flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.860]   Your boasting is not good.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.780]   Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.180]   Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump just as you are in fact unleavened.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.860]   For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.340]   Therefore let us celebrate the feast not with old leaven nor with the leaven of malice or
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.740]   wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.340]   I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.420]   I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world or with the covetous and swindlers
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.860]   or with idolaters.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.300]   For then you would have to go out of the world.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.580]   But actually I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:14.380]   person or covetous or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a swindler, not even to eat
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.780]   with such a one.
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.380]   For what have I to do with judging outsiders?
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.060]   Do you not judge those who are within the church?
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.820]   But those who are outside God judges.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.380]   Remove the wicked man from among yourselves."
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.100]   Pretty intense, really intense.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.000]   That's an incredible passage that really kind of sobers you up like, whoa, right?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.100]   But it was the exact same sentiment that Apostle Paul had the same expectation as the Lord
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.600]   towards his community.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.980]   And the sentiment isn't so much that, "Hey, you've got to be so righteous you have a zero
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.300]   tolerance policy."
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.300]   Right?
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   That's not what he was saying.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.700]   But what he was saying is, "You don't care enough.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.740]   Perhaps you're arrogant.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.100]   Perhaps you're self-preserving.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.500]   Perhaps you are thinking more so of your own comfort that you did not go to speak to this
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.060]   person.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.680]   You kept your distance.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.340]   You said, 'Yeah, he's that, but I'm not, so I'm okay.'
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.020]   But so long as you're okay, is it okay?"
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.020]   And the answer is, "Absolutely not."
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.540]   And as a matter of fact, if we're so concerned with ourselves, he actually says, "You are
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.900]   boastful.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   You are arrogant."
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:34.300]   And in my mind, arrogant people and boastful people are the most cowardice because they
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.660]   have so much to lose.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.860]   And that's the scenario.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.820]   Sometimes we don't want to get involved with the sins of other people because we fear losing
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.500]   something in that.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.740]   We have an automatic self-defensive, self-preserving mentality when it comes to getting involved
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.300]   with other people's trouble.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   And maybe we were taught.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300]   I was taught all the time.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.460]   It's like, something's going down and your parents go, "No, no, just go, go, go."
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.340]   And they rush you out of there.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.220]   They say, "Don't even look," or whatever.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.220]   "Don't get involved."
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:12.820]   Well, maybe when you are just trying to survive, maybe when you're in a certain environment
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.300]   where, again, you have no business getting involved, but when it comes to the church
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.620]   and the community of God, when it comes to your people, God says, "You need to care
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.180]   actually all the more."
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:29.180]   Or do you despise that individual that you're not seeking to restore him?
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.080]   That's the mentality here.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.580]   So the emphasis is pretty clear, right?
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:41.340]   That we talked about, A, we all need to have the discernment to be able to say, "Hey,
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:48.580]   by conviction of the Word of God accurately, very accurately, this is against His will."
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:53.020]   But also to have that desire to pursue the individual and say, "I'm willing to get
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.020]   involved here.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.280]   I'm willing to get involved."
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.020]   So the emphasis is there.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.660]   Now, we ask the question then, the reason why this is so intense and the reason why
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.740]   the judgment is so intense, why?
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:13.180]   We have to ask the question, "My goodness, earlier there were different kinds of laws
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:21.860]   pertaining to equity and fairness and balance, and then some of these sins that we see within
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.540]   the passage, we're going to read it in a little bit, but you're going to notice like,
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.460]   'Hey, yeah, I can see why it's so bad, but others of them, not so much.'"
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.900]   There's a question of why is it so intense?
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.280]   Why is the judgment elevated and escalated?
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:44.080]   And the reason why is because, A, or one, the sin that God is talking about here has
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.940]   direct offense to God's holy name.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.780]   That's the rationale that God gives for many of these instances.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:57.900]   He says, "When you do this, you defile my sanctuary and you profane my holy name."
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:07.480]   So there's an element here, it's God takes what we do as a community very personally,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.120]   right?
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.080]   Like he takes it personally, like, "Oh," it's like you did it directly to him, and an individual
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.960]   might be like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, I wasn't straight up trying to rebel against you,"
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.400]   but God takes it that way.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.440]   Why?
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:31.120]   Is because when the people of God, especially pertaining to the sins of worshiping Moloch,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.640]   and later on it talks about going to mediums and spirits, and later on it's going to talk
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.620]   about sexual perversions, God says, "What you do in that moment is rebel against my
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:49.220]   very presence," because right now they're in the context where God in the book of Exodus,
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.220]   it's a carry-on, right?
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:56.220]   God in the book of Exodus met them, revealed his glory, covered in the cloud, and then
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.180]   said, "I want you to build a tabernacle."
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.180]   Why?
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:12.780]   Exodus 25.8 says, "Let them construct a sanctuary for me that I may dwell among them."
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:19.260]   God's intention was that his very presence would be seen, evidenced, experienced, and
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.020]   enjoyed amongst the people of God.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.900]   In the Old Testament, it's covered, the glory is covered, right?
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.300]   But nonetheless, the intention of God is revealed.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:35.300]   And so, when the people of God persist in these idolatries, when the people of God go
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.300]   to Moloch, when the people of God go to mediums, when the people of God go to perversions of
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:47.100]   sexuality, what they do is they strive against God's intention to be one with his people.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.500]   And we're going to talk more about that in a little bit, but just keep that in mind,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:59.620]   that the reason why the punishment is escalated to capital punishment is because God has taken
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.380]   it personally as a rejection of his intent to be one with his people.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.380]   Okay?
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.820]   All right.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.660]   So more on that later to come.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.660]   Number three.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:16.620]   Oh, here we go.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.860]   The sin of turning to mediums and spirits.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.500]   Take a look at the text here, and in verse six through eight, the word of God says, "As
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.820]   for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists, to play the harlot after them,
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:35.580]   I will also set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.700]   You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the Lord your God.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.140]   You shall keep my statutes and practice them.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.420]   I am the Lord who sanctifies you."
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:53.420]   What's more, in verse 27, way down at the end of the chapter, he talks about the same
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:59.060]   concept and he says, "Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.500]   be put to death.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.700]   They shall be stoned with stones.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.540]   Their blood guiltiness is upon them."
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.580]   Okay?
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.860]   As we take a look at that, the simple truths are there that both the conjurer, okay, the
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:18.420]   person who is the medium, and the person who uses their services are guilty and therefore
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.020]   punishable by death.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.220]   They're worthy of capital punishment is what the Lord says.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.140]   So here's another instance where we ask, like, "Oh, we get it?"
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:34.380]   Because God is spirit, he does not condone any consulting with demons, any consulting
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.580]   with other spirits, fake spirits, whatever it may be.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.460]   But there's that question again.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.860]   Why is it so severe?
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.340]   What are they doing?
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.660]   Why do people seek mediums, you know?
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:52.780]   And to tell you truthfully, it's not so far-fetched from when people seek mediums and spirits
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.860]   and superstitious stuff and even in our day.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.860]   Here's kind of a running list, right?
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.220]   The medium literally is just an intermediary, okay, meaning he's a channeler.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:11.180]   He communicates on behalf of the people, okay, to dead spirits.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.540]   He's like the mediator, right?
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:20.500]   And when you think about that, then the people are going to that medium so that they could
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.660]   seek future knowledge.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.340]   Many people try to consult spirits, especially ancient spirits, so that they could predict
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.340]   the future.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:33.540]   They can talk about what can I expect in terms of the success of my endeavor, the business,
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:41.020]   The next one, we have that people have this practice of seeking blessing from their ancestors.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.780]   You know, the idea of like, "Oh, Father, look down on us, have grace," right?
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.620]   As they look to their ancestors who are before them, "You know what it means to suffer.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.780]   You've gone before us.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.380]   Bless our path."
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.460]   There are individuals who seek protection from these spirits, right?
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.660]   To say that they have a shroud of, you know, even this mentality that there's just this
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:06.700]   like entire mass of people who've gone before us and died, who are watching over our steps,
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.160]   and in specific cases when they intervene into our lives to protect us from danger and
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.700]   make sure we don't suffer too much.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:19.420]   And then lastly, there are many individuals who look fondly at these mediums, or not fondly,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:25.140]   but try to pursue it and then look fondly at this practice because they want to regain
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.820]   what was lost, right?
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.260]   Individuals who clung so tightly to their family, and when the patriarch or matriarch
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.260]   or whoever is the leader leaves, they want to cling back and regain that power that they
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:41.620]   had or whatever it may be, and that's why they look to these things.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.380]   But if you think about it then, when you take a look at those things that I highlighted,
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.460]   future blessings, you know, seeking the blessings and protection, what we can conclude is it
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:57.620]   looks like the people are looking for a deliverer, looking for life solutions, looking for a
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:03.180]   rest from suffering, looking for a savior, a deliverer from their hard times, looking
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.400]   for a God, right?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.820]   So all coming back and connecting it to this, we said God takes it very personally when
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.860]   people consult Moloch, when people consult mediums.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:23.340]   Absolutely so, because when we think about what they're seeking, they're seeking another
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.500]   person who will provide what God only provides, and that's why God sees the sin of seeking
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:34.220]   those things from mediums as adultery, as adultery.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.660]   God sees the sin of offering anything to Moloch, let alone precious babies, but anything to
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.180]   Moloch as absolute harlotry, absolute harlotry.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.300]   And so for us, we take a moment to think about this, and there's some applications for us.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:58.940]   Now, we may not be specifically going to Moloch, and we may not be going to mediums.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:04.220]   However, the pursuit can be something we sympathize with, right?
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   The pursuit of the deliverer, the mediator, the savior, the provider, the help, the rest,
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.660]   the replacement God.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.860]   That is something that many people actually have a very difficult time with, and we have
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.260]   to see that the way God does.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.300]   We have to make sure we understand God's heart.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.980]   He desires to dwell with us.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.780]   He desires to be one with us.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.260]   He has made in his first steps.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.620]   He's shown himself.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.860]   He's come down.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.460]   And then, to have the people say, "We've already got somebody else."
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.580]   Of course God is going to take that person.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.220]   Of course he's going to be offended.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:47.620]   Of course he's going to be livid, and then he's going to judge.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.660]   I created you for me.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:56.740]   And they're in a context right now, in the context of the scene where they're at, where
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.940]   they're covenanting.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.820]   I want to be your God.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.260]   You're going to be my people, and we're going to have this relationship.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.220]   But that's what the people are sinning against, and that's why it's so severe.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.540]   So I just want to make sure that we kind of feel the brunt of that, because the terminology
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.220]   then that God uses is not simply, "You're making a mistake," which sometimes we downplay.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.220]   We're not simply doing what everybody else does, going through life, making our mistakes,
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.660]   and then maturing as we go.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.780]   But God says, "I see it like wicked flirtation with the gross world.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:38.660]   I see it like unfaithfulness, hearts of cheaters, seeking approval, affection from the basings
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.660]   of this life.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.580]   And what's worse, God will call it prostitution."
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:50.260]   And he calls it, "You are whoring yourself after Mullen, seeking his blessing.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.620]   You sacrifice your babies."
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.540]   An ultimate last-ditch effort to be blessed by Mullen.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.780]   That's horrendous.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.780]   It is detestable.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:07.740]   And at this point now, I want to say a couple other things about this, because there is
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.360]   an element of we have to understand the heart of God.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.900]   It almost seems a bit of a dangerous area that I'm going into now, but I'm going to
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:23.280]   ask the question, have you ever wondered how sad God was during this time?
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.300]   Have you ever wondered in our day, when we come to church and it's just like, we have
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.900]   certain moments where we're like, "Oh man, I hit a plateau.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.900]   I'm apathetic.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.740]   I honestly don't really care that much.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.380]   And it's just hard for me to get excited."
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:47.700]   Have you ever in those moments, took a moment to ask, "How sad is God?"
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.540]   Now God is almighty.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.660]   God is infinite.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:56.980]   God is not a God that's like us, insecure and wondering, "Oh my goodness, what's going
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.980]   to happen in the future?"
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.860]   That's not God.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:06.900]   But God is grieved when the ones he loves reject him, feel apathetic towards him, and
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.140]   does not reciprocate the kind of love he shows.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:17.140]   I feel like just in this chapter, when you read the law, you can hear God's heart.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.140]   Why?
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.940]   Because he says certain things which perhaps come off with high emotion.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.900]   Oh, I think I went a little too far ahead.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.140]   Here, Leviticus chapter 20, verse 7.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:34.380]   You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am the Lord your God.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.900]   When you read it, did you read it like, "I am the Lord your God.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.900]   Obey!"
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.100]   Right?
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.780]   Or did you read it like, "Do not chase after the idols.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.140]   I'm the Lord your God."
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.140]   Right?
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.820]   Did you read it like, "Consecrate yourself.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:57.020]   You shall keep my statutes and practice them, because I'm the one who sanctifies you."
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.540]   And then take a look at this next passage.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.900]   He says, "You are therefore to keep all my statutes and all my ordinances and do them,
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.700]   so the land of which I am bringing you to will not spew you out.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.700]   Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nations, which I will drive out before
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.700]   you."
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.700]   Right?
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.700]   I'm going to drive out the people before you.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.260]   "For they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:25.220]   Hence I said to you, you are to possess their land, and I myself will give it to you to
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.220]   possess it.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.980]   A land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.980]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.980]   Right?
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.820]   Do you think he's saying, "I'm going to bless you with this wonderful land.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.660]   I'm the Lord your God!"
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.660]   Right?
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.180]   That's not the tone, I think.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.540]   He says, "I separated you from the peoples.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.580]   You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal, the unclean, between the
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.500]   unclean bird and the clean bird.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.060]   You shall not make yourself detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.260]   on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.620]   Thus, you are to be holy to me."
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.620]   Why?
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:07.420]   "Because I am, so I the holy, sorry, I the Lord am holy, and I have set you apart from
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.060]   the peoples to be mine."
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:15.540]   That's incredible.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:22.860]   God saw his people, the whole congregation of people, as a precious possession for him.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.580]   And his love is being poured out in every single fashion to protect them, guard them,
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.860]   lead them, and then ultimately sanctify them.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.420]   He says, "I'm the one who's going to bless you.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.500]   I'm the one who's going to deliver you.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.180]   I'm the one who's going to cause you to prosper."
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.180]   And you look to Molech asking him to bless you?
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.580]   You go to your mediums asking them to deliver you?
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.620]   Is it not appropriate for God to feel sad?
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.580]   Rejected?
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.080]   You know what's really crazy?
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:02.820]   Is that the sacrifice to Molech and the horrible practice of sacrificing infants to babies
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:09.500]   and the idol worship of this unreal God clearly was existence in this time.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.700]   Yes, already people were practicing them.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:24.380]   At this time, it was about 1445 BC, and king after king after king, the vast majority of
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.380]   them practiced idol worship to Molech.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.580]   Did you know even King Solomon near the latter half of his reign, he set up a high place
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.420]   where the sacrifice to Molech was happening?
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:40.380]   Did you know kings like Ahaz and Manasseh and all these people, they all sacrificed
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.300]   to Molech?
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   That's over 900 years.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.340]   From this time to then when King Josiah reformed that and said, "Dude, get rid of that high
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.340]   place."
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:55.780]   That's 900 years of unfaithfulness, rejection.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.260]   That's wild to think about.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.900]   Have we ever considered how God feels about that?
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.900]   Because to tell you truthfully, I felt so rebuked because there was a sentiment when
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.380]   I read through the passages initially.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.700]   I said, "Oh man, clearly this chapter is all about death.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.460]   You deserve to die."
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:20.520]   And then when I read like, "Oh, when a man sleeps with just a woman who happens to be
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.740]   on her cycle or like an individual uncovers the body of somebody and then he says, "They
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.980]   all deserve to die."
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.180]   As a matter of fact, burn both of them, right?
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.380]   And you're just like, "What's going on?"
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.980]   But then once I started thinking, "How does God feel though?"
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.180]   It really challenged my sense of, "This is inappropriate."
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.100]   It really challenged my sense of what is appropriate judgment and not.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.420]   And as we get into that question of what is appropriate and not, I want us to think about
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:54.180]   this, the heart of idolatry and what God is actually judging.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.460]   I want us to remember, lest we be like, "Well, I don't really go and worship Molech.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.700]   I don't go and worship ancestors.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:06.940]   That's like, you know, ancestors before us, but we've completely let go of that, right?"
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.220]   Remember that Molech is not real.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.980]   Mediums are not real.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980]   Idols are not real.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.740]   Do you know what they are?
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.740]   They're created by you and I.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.180]   Let me repeat that.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.180]   Idols are not real.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.580]   They're not real things.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.020]   They're created by you and me.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.580]   They're created by people.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:33.140]   Remember that these things are created representations of our hopes and dreams, the Israelites'
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.140]   hopes and dreams.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.620]   Molech is their created solution to their problems that they see in their time.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.380]   Molech is their wishes and desires carved into wood.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:49.340]   Molech is their ultimate human attempt to acquire blessings on their terms.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.940]   It doesn't have to be Molech.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.100]   Throughout generations and generations, there were always something.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.740]   Egyptians, powerful nations, mediums, alliances with superpowers, asterisk poles, whatever
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.660]   it may be, they found a replacement for God.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.060]   And that's the conviction for us today in this passage.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:17.560]   I am willing to bet most of us struggle with these, you know, perhaps unnamed idols, which
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:24.580]   we turn to as our dreams, hopes, solutions, wishes, desires, and blessings.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.780]   And they become to us a replacement for God.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.700]   And that is what God is judging.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.460]   That idolatrous heart to seek the blessing outside of our Creator.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:44.620]   That idolatrous heart to seek that rest, satisfaction.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.220]   God wants to be our all in all.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.140]   And yet so many times we reject Him and replace Him with something else.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.660]   That's what God is judging, and that's why it's so intense.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.140]   And one might say, "Wait a minute.
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.140]   That's every sin."
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.820]   Bingo.
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.360]   And that is why every sin is worthy of death.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.260]   And that is why every sin is so destructive.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.420]   And that is why God and before the Lord, there is no diminished small mistake of sins.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.140]   And there are no such things as, "Ah, everybody does it, so let's bypass this."
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:24.180]   Every single sin before the Holy God is idolatrous.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.180]   It is.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.500]   And so I wanted to make sure that we understand that today.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.580]   Now going through the rest of the passage, we're going to speed up a little bit and take
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.540]   bigger chunks.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:41.580]   And what's really interesting then is we see that that selfish heart, the heart seeking,
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.580]   right?
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:48.020]   The heart lusting after that satisfaction, the fulfillment, and the hopes.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.420]   Most often it will present itself with sexual lust.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.700]   And that's what we were learning back in chapter 18, right?
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.460]   We were learning that when a heart is selfish, maybe you're selfish with your time, you're
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.820]   kind of selfish with your authority, you're selfish with your powers, meaning you use
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.100]   it for yourself, right?
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.280]   You use all the privileges you have for yourself.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:13.140]   What you will find is that the way then it will typically express itself is through sexual
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.380]   lust.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:20.580]   And so in the next sections we have lots of sins against family and crossing immoral lines
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.340]   of sexuality.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:26.780]   Now before we read the entire section, I want to say this.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:32.260]   When we read the law of God, we are going to see his heart is kind of what we were looking
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.620]   at earlier, but we're also going to see God's value system, right?
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:42.060]   When you look at the law of the land, you are going to understand that land's values,
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.620]   what they really treasure.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.460]   Case example, America.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.160]   We value money and success.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:55.300]   And that's why if an individual is guilty of the felony of laundering money, you know,
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:00.840]   if they're guilty of taking finances and putting it into other countries or even actual cash
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.100]   and mishandling currency, did you know that the typical sentence can range from a minimum
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:12.320]   10 years to a maximum of 20, 30, 40 years, depending on how big the infraction, some
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.260]   people have mounted like multiple lifetime sentences, right?
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.660]   But did you know that in America, the average person who is guilty of rape, convicted and
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.100]   tried and guilty, typically only serves six years.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.580]   The average sentence that's give out is about nine years.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.500]   Now the thing about it is you're just like, what?
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.940]   But there's a sense to which, yeah, the voice or the value, so to speak.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.880]   And so that law of the land kind of shows you what are certain things that the people
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.220]   are like, this is unacceptable, right?
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.220]   It kind of shows.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:50.100]   Well, when we look at this, then we have the majority of this chapter and then now repeating
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.200]   chapter 18 and other sections, you know, it's going to come up again, talking about these
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.180]   infractions, perversions of sexuality and against the family as well.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.940]   So that's kind of intro to this next section.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:08.860]   First, there is sin of cursing the parents in verse nine and verse, oh, it's up there.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:15.100]   Verse nine reads, if there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.100]   be put to death.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.740]   He has cursed his father or his mother.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.340]   His blood guiltiness is upon him.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.260]   Moving forward, the next section is verse 10 to verse 16.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.900]   I apologize, that's kind of small.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.260]   And it says, if there is a man who commits adultery with another man's wife, so there's
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:38.340]   adultery, one who commits adultery with his friend's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.300]   shall surely be put to death.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.320]   If there is a man who lies with his father's wife, he has uncovered his father's nakedness.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.540]   Both of them shall surely be put to death.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.840]   Their blood guiltiness is upon them.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.180]   If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.300]   They have committed incest.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.040]   Their blood guiltiness is upon them.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.580]   If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.420]   committed a detestable act.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.560]   They shall surely be put to death.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.940]   Their blood guiltiness is upon them.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.720]   If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother, it is immorality.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.900]   Both he and they shall be burned with fire so that there will be no immorality in your
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.940]   midst.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.720]   If there is a man who lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.620]   You shall also kill the animal.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.380]   If there is a woman who approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.020]   and the animal, and they shall surely be put to death.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.500]   Their blood guiltiness is upon them.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.540]   So within that passage, there's a lot going on there.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.300]   Okay, there's a lot going on there.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.940]   But we saw everything that, again, was repeated in the chapter 18, so I'm not going to go
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.180]   over each one.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:54.300]   But there was everything from adultery to incest, homosexuality, polygamy, bestiality.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.660]   And sometimes when we read this in our modern day, we're like, "My goodness, where is the
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.660]   self-control?"
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.660]   You know?
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.460]   "My goodness, this is like rampant sin.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.140]   There's no restraint."
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.640]   But in thinking about this, it's kind of like, "Wow, this has existed from long, long ago,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.940]   and this is also existent today."
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.580]   Why are these sexual perversions also punishable by death?
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.720]   We mentioned this earlier, and we're going to say it again.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.940]   Sexual perversions destroy God's highly precious possession.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:35.100]   Earlier, we made the mention that the laws signify, at least point to us, what does He
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.900]   value.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:43.360]   And what He clearly values is the relationship, the purity of the relationships that we have.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.220]   God absolutely cares for the vertical relationships.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.180]   God actually values the horizontal relationships.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:54.660]   On all dimensions, God cares for the relational value that exists in all of us.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   Why?
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:01.100]   Because those relationships really mark us as bearing the image of God.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:06.100]   And so with that said, when we think about these sins where there is no care for these
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:12.900]   relational values and relational purity, as a matter of fact, there's a selfishness of
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:19.580]   going to even the cost of breaking friendships, even breaking the boundaries of family, breaking
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:26.620]   the boundaries of what's natural, breaking the boundaries even of human to animal.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.660]   Here I just want to move a little bit quickly and say this.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:36.300]   In this moment then, one of the convictions we're going to have is the sins that we sometimes
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:42.900]   presume to be individual and private, the sins that we presume are unseen and therefore
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:49.540]   does not hurt anybody, is actually destructive relationally.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.260]   Is destructive, absolutely destructive on multiple levels.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:58.460]   Perhaps our rationale says certain things like, "Oh, but I need to escape.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.740]   The week was so hard.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.140]   I need the rest."
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.340]   No one's going to know and no one's going to care.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.660]   But those we know are all lies of the devil.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.620]   Rather, we recognize that within this context, what's going to happen when an individual
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.980]   pursues daughter-in-law, individual pursues a friend's wife, individual pursues boundaries
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:24.460]   that are not meant to be crossed, even if those sins are private, we're going to end
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.140]   up deeply hurting the ones we love.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.620]   We're going to cheat people of their dignity.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.780]   We're going to sin against their character, and ultimately we are going to break the relational
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.780]   bonds that God has ordained.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:44.780]   So when we think about this then, we recognize that God absolutely takes these sins very
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:50.140]   seriously, even if this world, this current generation, would be like, "Dude, that's
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140]   me and my body.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.580]   That's me and my relationship.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.980]   If we're consenting, what's the big deal?"
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.220]   But God says no.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:04.300]   He takes these absolutely seriously, and in every one of those sections throughout this
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.100]   chapter, he's called it for what it is.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.660]   He's called looking at people's nakedness a disgrace.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.380]   He's called it abhorrent.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.820]   He's called it for what it is, sin.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.500]   So moving quickly, I'm just going to pass this section here and go to some application.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:29.140]   Earlier, we talked about how we really want to see the heart of God, and I asked an interesting
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.620]   question that perhaps sometimes we should think about even more regularly.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.100]   How does God feel about all this?
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.020]   Is he in our radar?
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.060]   Are we acknowledging him?
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:46.340]   But here now, we should definitely think about our theology of what is sin and how does it
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.420]   affect us.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:53.580]   Application one, we have to make sure that we see every sin as a destroyer of our relationship
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.060]   on every dimension.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.080]   On every dimension.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:07.320]   We have to remember that the severity of sin is in the context of God's covenant relationship.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:13.580]   We have to remember that our sins even against each other are on the context of family relationships.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.300]   We're absolutely brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.740]   We're co-heirs, right?
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.180]   We're in the household of God.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:26.020]   And so that's why I believe when God gives the punishment within this chapter, it fits
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.900]   the bill.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.140]   God regularly in the scriptures gives punishment that is what's what we call just desserts,
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   right?
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.140]   So people are like, "Oh, I'm so hungry.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.140]   How come you don't give us food?"
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   And then God says, "Okay."
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.220]   And then he just shoves them with the food in their mouth, right?
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.220]   When they start complaining like, "Oh, we don't have this king."
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.700]   He's like, "You want that king?
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.700]   Okay."
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.940]   They get a king and they abuse him, exploit them, and press them, right?
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.740]   There are some just desserts.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:57.500]   Well, likewise, when there is a breaking of the covenant, God says that I'm going to cut
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.060]   you off from me and I'm going to cut you off from the people, right?
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:08.340]   And in that way, God addresses that element of the relational consequence of the sins
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.340]   we commit.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:13.780]   And then secondly, as a second application, I just want to make mention of the fact that
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:19.940]   for us, when we think about sometimes the more predominant sins that affect us in our
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.660]   day, yeah, there's materialism.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:28.620]   Yes, there's trying to, you know, not be honest, dishonest game.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.020]   There's greed, right?
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:36.700]   But for this generation, there is a prevalence of sexual immorality that is attacking every
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.980]   single one of us.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.700]   And with that said, I want us to make sure how the...
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:48.020]   Like, at least see how these various passages in both chapter 18, 19, and now 20 is highlighting
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:56.180]   for us that sexual sin is almost a surmounting fruit of the general selfishness that exists
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.580]   within us.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.460]   And so the general worldliness that we exhibit in our life, that's going to feed our sexual
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   perversions.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.300]   There's a passage in scripture, 1 John chapter 2, it's up there for us now.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.140]   He says, "Do not love the world or the things in the world.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.340]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:20.140]   For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.860]   pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.700]   The world is passing away, and also its lusts."
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.340]   Here's the thing.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:38.980]   I really feel like, you know, the fight against sexuality, or sexual immorality-wise, many
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.060]   people feel like they're powerless and losing.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.260]   And to me, that's so unfortunate.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:51.580]   But the way I see it is, if you're at a point where the lust, the passions are strong, like,
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:57.540]   you're probably at a point where that- let's describe sexual immorality as, like, an incredibly
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:02.500]   buff monster, or a guy who's been working out.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.220]   Our selfishness, earlier what I mentioned, of our time, our self-interest with our thoughts,
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:12.580]   our expectations of people serving us, our self-interest with our powers and resources,
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:17.900]   that's like making that monster work out, you know, lift heavy, eat protein, and all
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.900]   that kind of stuff.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.700]   We're drinking the shake of our other selfishness.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.940]   And by the time we're facing sexual- temptations of sexual immorality, we're absolutely going
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.580]   to lose.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.220]   Because the scripture, when it talks about sexual lust, it talks about it in a way where
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:39.340]   it reminds me, in Romans chapter 1, that there is these passions, these lusts that are degrading.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.020]   And even though they see the power of God, even though they see God as creation, that
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.020]   lust is so strong, it's just plowing through that and saying, "I don't care, I want what
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.020]   I want."
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:53.220]   And if that's what God says, then I'll give you over to your lust, right?
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:00.780]   The New Testament calls these passions epithumia, which is cravings, it's a hunger, it's a yearning.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.700]   And if it's been fed by selfishness, it's going to be so wrong and so strong, and that's
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:09.260]   why so many people feel like, "I don't have the power to combat it."
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.280]   So as a practical challenge to every single one of us, because the chapter had so much
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.900]   to say about sexual lust, in the discussion we're going to revisit just, "Has there been
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   any progress?"
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:25.060]   From chapter 18 to chapter 20, has there been any progress or movement, forward thinking?
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.780]   Has there been a strengthening of your soul?
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:33.340]   And I want to say, don't just think about fighting sexual immorality head on, but think
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.180]   about the totality of your life.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.500]   Are you orienting your life on feeding yourself?
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:45.060]   And the monster of sexual immorality is going to be so strong, of course you're going to
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   lose.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.820]   You know, I remember a time, you know, earlier on when I was, you know, like one of my first
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:55.180]   sermons I gave, I remember using how I love cars as an example.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.900]   And I did, I love cars.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.120]   And so because I did that, I had some friends buy me subscriptions to car magazines for
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.120]   like birthdays and stuff.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.120]   They gift me with it, right?
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.700]   It's like $30 for a one-year annual subscription.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   I get it, I'm like, "Cool!"
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:13.340]   You know, I'm like reading through it, only to realize this is filling the picture of
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.720]   the kingdom of Mark.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.140]   Because in order to have Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Bugattis, and all this kind of stuff,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.060]   you know what you got to have?
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.100]   You got to have millions.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.220]   You got to have millions, and you got to own stuff.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.220]   You know what else you got to have?
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.740]   You got to have mansions to store your cars.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.140]   So if you have millions, you have mansions, and you have cars, guess what else fills that
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.140]   scene?
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.540]   I mean, do they have middle-aged, graying guys laying on the hood of the car saying
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.540]   like, "Hey, hey, hey, behind this car."
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.580]   No, what do they have?
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.480]   A woman in bikini laying on the top of the hood.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.720]   I remember thinking, "This is feeding my flesh."
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.840]   I remember thinking, "It's just a car magazine.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.240]   I'm getting rid of every single one of these things.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.040]   Please don't buy me car magazines, okay?
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.440]   I'm trying to get rid of it all."
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.440]   Why?
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.840]   Because it's filling the picture of the kingdom of Mark, and in the kingdom of Mark, I'm going
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.160]   to have my way.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.400]   That's why sometimes fighting sexual morality seems so tough, because you're going against
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   the kingdom.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.200]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:19.760]   You have to fight selfishness at its core towards idolatry, towards the pursuit of all
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.080]   the things we talked about, the safety, the deliverer, the medium, whatever it may be,
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.280]   that we dare not go against the Lord.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.680]   A way of conclusion, I know I went a little long already, but I want to conclude by reading
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:40.400]   again the section where God is reiterating His exhortation to be faithful to His command.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:47.480]   And this is what He says, "You are therefore to keep all My statutes and My ordinances
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:53.840]   and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.080]   Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nation, which I will drive out before
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:03.280]   you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:09.600]   Hence I said to you, you are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.120]   possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.360]   I am the Lord your God, who has separated you from the peoples.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.880]   You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean animal, and
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:27.280]   between the unclean bird and the clean, and you shall not make yourself testable by animal
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.680]   or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   unclean.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:41.920]   Thus, you are to be holy to Me, for I the Lord am holy, I have set you apart from the
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.560]   peoples to be Mine."
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.240]   What's really interesting is thinking about the context again.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:57.520]   In context, they're standing on dirt, looking at desert in front of a mountain, not in a
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.380]   land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.200]   What they need now most of all is to trust God's loving word.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.000]   You will be Mine, and that trust is going to cause them to be faithful.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   That's the same for you and me.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.760]   Let's pray.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.280]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much, God.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:25.880]   Surprising Lord, we feel like just looking at your law, we saw your heart, Lord, that
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:31.480]   through your law, you are sparing your people, protecting your people.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:37.880]   And likewise, as you are a good Father, we recognize, Lord, you're showing us, Lord,
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   both the principles, the commands, but also the reason why.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.160]   And I pray, Father God, that we would understand it, and what's more, Lord, that we would respond
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.360]   with love, with trust, and I desire, Father God, to follow you.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:01.040]   I pray for any individual here who feels far from you, Lord, today, God, that they
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:06.960]   would recognize, Lord, that your ultimate intent in sanctifying these people, Lord,
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:12.440]   is to be one with them, and God, that you are on a mission to cause us to be perfected
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.120]   in Christ.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:19.360]   And so, Lord, that too, Father, we trust and desire all the more, Father God, to draw near
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.440]   to you.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.240]   We thank you again for your word today.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   It's in Christ's name.
