[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Hi, my name is Sang, and I'm married to Lynn, and I have two kids, Hunter and Haley, and
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.840]   I'll share my testimony today.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.280]   I grew up on an island called Saipan in the Pacific Ocean, and I started attending church
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000]   at an early age with my mom and my sister.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.600]   I don't remember the details, but I do remember standing up to accept Jesus at our church
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   summer VBS.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   Sadly, I don't remember if I really knew what I was standing up for.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.740]   Maybe it's because all the other kids were standing up.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.400]   I always went to church growing up, and in a different island called Guam, I was baptized
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.960]   when I was in high school.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.620]   Again, the details are a bit fuzzy, and I'm not too sure what I was thinking or believing
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.360]   at that time.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.360]   Come to think about it, because of my inability to remember such a significant event, I have
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.640]   a lot of doubts about my belief and acceptance of Christ while I was in high school.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.920]   From Guam, I moved to Irvine to attend UCI and started attending church, and I remember
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.640]   in college, I was really passionate as a Christian.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.280]   I went to church as often as I could.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   I went on two short-term missions and was actively serving at church.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.060]   Yet even for my college years, always going to church, serving, sadly, I don't really
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.040]   remember acknowledging the gravity of my sinfulness or having that great thankfulness of Christ
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.600]   saving my soul or desiring to really know God myself through his words.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.280]   I don't remember studying the Bible much either to know about God and about Jesus, and it's
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.960]   likely that I served church to glorify myself.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   Personality-wise, I know I'm very conscious of what others think, especially at church,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.000]   and my service might have been to satisfy that personality need.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.840]   What I can remember clearly is when I started attending Berean, I began to ask a lot of
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.720]   questions about church, about myself, about my faith, about my salvation, and about the
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.560]   doubts that would often creep into my mind when I felt to sin.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.360]   Is my faith genuine?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.080]   Do I have real assurance of salvation?
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.040]   God gave me this desire to know more about him through his words and the messages that
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.000]   were preached in order to answer those questions.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.960]   I remember learning for the first time, at least from what I can remember, about Genesis
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.280]   315, the first mention of the gospel in the Bible.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.400]   I remember being blown away that the hope of Christ was stated from the beginning, and
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   as a Christian, a lifelong Christian, a bit ashamed that I didn't know this.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.000]   It helped that the church leadership constantly reminded us to read and study his words ourselves.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   And by doing so, it led me to realize how sinful I am, that I'm deserving of death
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.800]   and condemnation.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.040]   Yet because of his love for me, Christ died, shed his blood, resurrected, so that I can
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.200]   be forgiven of my sins and be united with God.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.280]   Colossians 1, 21 to 22 reads, "And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.440]   mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshy body through
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.560]   death in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach."
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.960]   And because of that, I have hope.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.080]   I constantly fall to sin, turn and drift from God, much like the Israelites, and yet there
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   is hope for me because of what Christ has done.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   His blood has cleansed me once and for all.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.600]   As a child of God, I can now find true rest in God.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.640]   The burden of working, providing for my family, and just dealing with the chaos of my life,
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.240]   it's doable for me because I can find rest in the arms of my Father.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.000]   Constantly in my life, I have sought the things of the world to find comfort.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.220]   Yet I realized that true rest and peace comes from being in the presence of my Father above.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.440]   Being a dad myself, I would pretty much do anything to provide for my kids and to protect
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.240]   them.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.520]   Even if they don't listen, even if they make mistakes, even if they told me that they hate
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.400]   me, I'll continue to love them and do all that I can for them.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.200]   I know and I believe that God's love for me is so much greater than that, more than I
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.400]   can comprehend or imagine.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.840]   I know there will be struggles and difficulties as I live my short life on earth, but it is
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.640]   my hope and prayer that I won't drift away and waste my life.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.600]   But focus my eyes on Christ and run this race with His guidance.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   [silence]
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   [pouring water]
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   [indistinct]
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   This might not work after.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   [laughter]
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   Thanks, seriously, thank you so much for that testimony.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   What a reminder for all of us that everything that you said is true for every single one of us.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   As much as we love our kids, God loves all of you.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   So, you understand when you go into the water that you are being united with Christ in His death?
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   When you come out, you are being united with His resurrected life?
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   Yes, I do.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   [pouring water]
