[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   "and his mouth was wrapped around his waist,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   "and his food was locusts and wild honey.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.800]   "Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.200]   "about the Jordan were going out to him,
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.300]   "and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan,

[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.300]   "coming to his baptism, he said to them,

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700]   "'but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.'"
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.540]   Let's pray.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.300]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000]   We pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.100]   would convict and lead us.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.400]   And we ask, Lord God, that you give us fertile hearts,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.400]   that your word would come,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.600]   and that the enemy would not snatch it away,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.400]   that we would understand,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100]   that our hearts may be changed,
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.600]   that we may have a clear vision of Christ.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.700]   So help us, Lord God, to give you worship
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.600]   that is acceptable.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.900]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900]   Okay, Joe, can you check the air conditioning?
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.500]   All right.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   You know, as we said that we wanna spend this week,
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.300]   and then next week as we're talking about Christmas,
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.000]   when was the last time that you wanted something so badly,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.900]   you know, that you couldn't sleep,
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.100]   that you really wanted something?
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.400]   And again, the older we get,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.800]   it's harder for us to get excited about anything.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.600]   Some of you guys who are close to graduation,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.400]   you got like one more class, or six more units to go,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.600]   and then you know you're gonna graduate,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.200]   and you're just waiting for that day you can graduate,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   and you can have freedom,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.200]   you don't have to wake up in the morning,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   you don't have to do papers,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.600]   you don't have to worry about finals.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.200]   You know, some of you guys maybe got a Disneyland annual pass,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500]   and you know, you got next,
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.300]   you're gonna be on break in a couple weeks,
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.700]   and then you're waiting eagerly anticipating for that.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   Some of you guys just started dating,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.200]   you just had your DTR,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600]   and then you know,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.800]   you made your first date coming up next Saturday,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   and you're praying that Jesus would not come until then,
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400]   at least, so you can experience your first date.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.100]   Whatever it is that you're eagerly waiting for,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.400]   like when was the last time you were so excited,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   and so eager to have that, you know?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.800]   If we're not careful,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.300]   we can be dictated,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.900]   our whole life can be dictated by whatever happens
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.900]   to catch our attention at that moment, you know?
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.000]   And that's why, you know, again, you know,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.500]   you guys are gonna think I'm picking on the Apple,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   but Apple's so genius, you know what I mean?
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.400]   Because they know how quickly we get satisfied
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.600]   or dissatisfied with something,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.100]   so every six months or so, something new constantly comes,
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.300]   kind of like gather our attention,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.200]   and you know, like that excitement of one phone,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900]   then it kind of dissipate three months later,
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.200]   and they build anticipation for the next phone,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.000]   and then you get that,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.800]   and then after a while you get tired of it,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.300]   they build anticipation for the next, you know?
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.100]   And that's the genius, that's the marketing genius,
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.000]   where you can have the same thing
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.500]   and just makes little, you know, switches,
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.700]   and then next thing you know, like,
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   it's like, oh, I need that, and you're waiting for it,
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   people are getting in line to get it.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.300]   I think, in my opinion, that's a microcosm of life itself.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.500]   It's not just Apple, you know, I know I pick on Apple,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.300]   but it's not just Apple, life itself.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.100]   We have so many things to distract us in life.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.600]   If we're not careful, whatever circumstance,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.900]   whatever situation that you may be in, right?
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.700]   If you're a parent, there are certain temptations
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.900]   that come to you because you're a parent.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   If you're a college student,
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.100]   there are certain temptations that come
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.500]   because you're a college student.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.900]   There's certain temptations that come
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.200]   because you're single and you're working,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   you have money, right?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.200]   When you get older, there's separate temptations that come.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.400]   But if we're not careful,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.300]   we can just kind of drift along in life,
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.500]   and then wake up one day realizing
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.400]   that you are going from one hope and one thing to another,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   and then you wake up one morning,
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.100]   and you know, you're in your 50s and you're in your 60s.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.900]   Now, I don't know when midlife really is, you know?
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.100]   I used to think midlife was somewhere in your late 30s,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.700]   but it seems like people are living longer and longer.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   And I see people heading into midlife crisis
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   sometime in their 40s.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.900]   And I can understand, I didn't understand in my 30s,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.300]   like, why are these guys all of a sudden getting a red Corvette
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   and doing crazy things, you know?
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.100]   And all of a sudden, these guys, you know,
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.700]   used to drive Priuses,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.500]   and all of a sudden, they got a motorcycle,
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.800]   and they're driving all over the place in their 40s.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   I can understand now why.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.000]   The reason why I think the midlife crisis happens, okay,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.300]   is because you kind of, life just happens to you, you know?
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.000]   In college, you think about life,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   you say, "Oh, I got all these dreams.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.000]   I'm gonna be a doctor. I'm gonna be this.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I'm gonna be that."
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.700]   And then you graduate, and life isn't exactly the way
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.000]   that you thought it would be in high school,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.400]   and then in college, you work hard to prepare.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.700]   And then, you know, you find somebody great,
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.000]   and you get married and have kids,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.200]   and then you live like that for five, six years,
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.900]   and you realize, "Huh, that's it."
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.200]   It really wasn't what you thought.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.400]   Whether you are making money or not making money,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.100]   whether you have a good job or not, have a great job.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.700]   And then that, once you get to that point,
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.100]   next 20, 30 years, looks exactly the same.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.300]   Okay? Are you depressed?
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.400]   Right?
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.800]   I thought you were supposed to encourage us.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.000]   I'm about to encourage you,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   but I need to depress you first, all right?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.800]   That's life. That really is life.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.500]   And so, when that really hits you is in midlife.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.400]   When you're about halfway through,
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.700]   you're looking ahead, and then you're looking back,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.300]   and you say, "I don't want the first half of my life
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.200]   to be repeated at the second half of my life."
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.000]   And so, what ends up happening is,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.100]   and then you feel like, "Well, I can't change now.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.400]   What am I going to do? Is this it?
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   Am I going to just keep going down this path,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.600]   and that's it?"
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.000]   And so, when that thought hits you,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   you all of a sudden, "I got to do something."
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.400]   And then, so, if you're a secular person,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.300]   I mean, you might think of like, "Okay, I'm going to do this."
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.900]   And maybe they cheat on their wives,
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.900]   get a motorcycle, and do crazy stuff.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.200]   They're going to travel. They're going to go bungee jumping
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   to make something of their life.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400]   Even if it is superficial.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.100]   So that when they hit their 50s and 60s and 70s,
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.300]   they can look back and say, "Oh, yeah, I did this."
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.300]   You know?
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   "What was your life worth?"
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.900]   And it's like, "Oh, I did this."
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.800]   See, we live half of our lives
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.400]   hoping and thinking like, "If I do this, this is going to happen."
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.700]   And then we live the second half of our lives
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.600]   regretting what he did, and trying to make up
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.300]   for the mistakes that we did in the first half of our life.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.800]   And that's the sad state.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   That's the sad, true state of mankind.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   They're always thinking that something today,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.900]   I mean, I'm not happy today, but something tomorrow.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.100]   Something, if I work hard enough, there's going to be a pay-off tomorrow.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.800]   Right?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.500]   If we're not careful,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.100]   we can live by the impulses of our flesh.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.700]   And one year goes by, two years go by,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.300]   and the older you get, right?
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.700]   And I think you all would testify,
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.300]   the older you get, time goes by much faster.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.700]   Because relatively, time gets shorter for us.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.200]   Right?
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.400]   And here's the truth.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.200]   If you're not careful,
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.000]   ten years, like that, it's gone.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.700]   You know?
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.900]   If you're not careful, boom, boom,
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.900]   you wake up and you're in your 50s and 60s,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.800]   and that was it.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.000]   That was your life.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Right?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That was your life.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.500]   Went to church, you know?
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.800]   Like, you had to find some good places to eat.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.500]   You know?
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.600]   Find the best yogurt shops in this area.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.500]   You know, new food coming out, new movie coming out.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   You know, the sports team, what sports team,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:21.000]   to get, what are some exciting sports things that are going on right now?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.600]   And then you live 20, 30, 40 years, and that's it.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   That's your life.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.100]   If you were to put your life resume,
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.900]   it's like, became a Christian, went to college,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.000]   got married, had kids,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.300]   went, you know, binge jumping,
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.200]   I traveled to these places,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.900]   ate some good food,
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.000]   and caught a huge fish.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.700]   That's your resume at the end of your life,
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.600]   if you're not careful.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.000]   We have to be careful that
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.200]   we actually are pursuing the things
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.600]   that we profess to be the most important thing in our life.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   Now, we say it in our mind, we put it on paper,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.900]   but if we were to examine what you really value
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   by the amount of money you spend,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.200]   the amount of time you spend,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.300]   and how much time you spend talking about it with other people,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.600]   based upon that,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   based upon the tangible things that we can see,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.000]   can somebody look at your life and say,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.700]   "That's a follower of Jesus Christ."
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.100]   They're pursuing Jesus.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.800]   When they talk to you for more than an hour,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.400]   at the end of that hour, would they say,
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.200]   "That guy is a follower of Jesus."
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.000]   Or would they say, "You are a Lakers fan."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.600]   Or, "You are a Warriors fan."
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.900]   That, "This guy loves hockey."
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.200]   "This guy has mastered all the video games that ever existed."
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.000]   Right?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.600]   What is it that we are pursuing?
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   What is it that we are eagerly waiting for?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.800]   The nation of Israel
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.700]   has been waiting for the Messiah for over 600 years.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.400]   Right?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.900]   To them, He was not just some theological person.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.300]   He wasn't just some being that was going to come,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.000]   who was going to be a leader among the Jewish religious sect.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.400]   To them, the coming of the Messiah was the answer to all their problems.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.100]   Remember, at 730 AD,
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.500]   the Assyrians came and they basically took
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.800]   the southern kingdom into captivity.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.100]   So, the ten kingdoms went and they disappeared in 730 AD,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.900]   at least for the most part.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.600]   And then about 100 years later,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.100]   the Babylonians come and they conquer the Assyrians,
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.700]   and they take the other two tribes,
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.300]   the tribe of Judah and Benjamin,
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.200]   and they go into captivity.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.100]   So, for over 600 years,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.500]   the nation of Israel did not have a legitimate nation.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.700]   And it was the most evident during the time of the Romans.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.000]   Even, and where that was most evident
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.800]   was when they went to worship at the Temple,
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.400]   and bowed down to the statue every time they entered the Temple.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.300]   And what that signified was,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.400]   that no matter how great you think your God is,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.500]   our leader is greater than yours.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.100]   And so, they had to live under that,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.100]   because they had no power.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.600]   And so, that's why when Jesus came,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.300]   and He was getting all this popularity,
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.800]   one of the first questions they asked,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.200]   "Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.300]   Basically, what they're asking is,
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.700]   "The money that you're giving to Caesar
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.000]   is giving them power to do this to us."
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   So, for 600 plus years,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.800]   as they were under the domination of foreign nations,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.200]   grandparents, parents to their children were saying,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.300]   "Yes, because our forefathers sinned,
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.300]   God judged us, and this is the state that we're in.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.000]   But, one day the Messiah is going to come,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.200]   and the Kingdom of Heaven is going to be restored."
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.100]   And when that happened, all this will come to an end.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.000]   And again, you have to understand
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.300]   that position that they were in,
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.100]   that if the Syrians, the Babylonians, the Persians,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.600]   whoever was in charge at that time,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.400]   anytime you say, "You know what?"
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   The king decides, "You know what?
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.700]   All the girls who are at the age of 20 to 30,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.000]   who are the prettiest in the land,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.300]   or the most talented, and most gifted,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.600]   I want them to marry Persian men."
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   And it was done.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.800]   Here's a guy who comes, and he becomes a billionaire.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.100]   He's like, "Hey, you're a Jew.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.700]   You don't have any, you have too much money.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.900]   And I'm going to come and put a tax on that,
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.500]   and take all your money."
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.300]   You have to understand that to live under a foreign,
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.200]   foreign government that was oppressing them,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.600]   meant that they didn't have the kind of freedom.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.700]   They had to worship the gods that they established,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.000]   or even the god that you worship
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.400]   had to be within the parameters that they established.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.700]   So their hope was that one day Messiah was going to come,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.200]   and they were going to deliver them.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.300]   Zechariah 9, 9-12,
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.100]   you know that passage about Jesus coming in,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.000]   riding on a donkey.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.500]   It says, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.100]   Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.200]   Behold, your king is coming to you,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.500]   righteous and having salvation,
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.600]   as he, humble and mounted on a donkey."
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.700]   Jesus said from the very get-go that he was the Messiah.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.300]   When he rode on that donkey coming to Jerusalem,
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.700]   that's 700 years of prophecy.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.900]   More than 700 years of prophecy
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.200]   that he's going to come and make everything better.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.600]   I want you to listen to the rest of the prophecy.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.000]   He says, "Humble and mounted on a donkey,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.100]   honor called the fall of a donkey.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.300]   I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.700]   and the war horse from Jerusalem.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.600]   And the battle bull shall be cut off,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.300]   and he shall speak peace to the nation.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.800]   His rule shall be from sea to sea,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.100]   from the river to the ends of the earth."
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.400]   In other words, he's saying that all the battles,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.500]   all the war that suppressed you,
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.700]   that he's going to finally conquer all of them,
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.400]   and then he's going to bring peace with the other nations,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.800]   and he's going to bring peace within the nation.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.900]   In Micah 4, 6, "In that day," declares the Lord,
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.500]   "I will assemble the lame,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.400]   and gather those who have been driven away,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.800]   and those whom I have afflicted.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.400]   And the lame I will make the remnant,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.500]   and those who were cast off a strong nation,
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.600]   and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   from this time forth and forevermore."
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   He said he's not only going to bless the rich,
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.500]   the aristocrats, he says the lame who are outcast,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.400]   even they will benefit when this Messiah comes,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.200]   when the kingdom of heaven is restored.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.300]   Amos 9, 11, 15, "In that day,
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.400]   I will raise up the booth of David that has fallen,
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.500]   and repair its breaches,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.800]   and raise up his ruins,
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.400]   and rebuild it as in the days of old.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.700]   I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel,
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.400]   and they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   They shall plant vineyards and drink their wine,
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   and they shall make gardens and eat their fruits.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.200]   I will plant them on their land,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.000]   and they shall never again be uprooted out of the land
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.300]   that I have given them, says the Lord your God."
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.700]   See all this is the description of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.000]   And so the whole purpose of John the Baptist
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.500]   was to come to prepare,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.200]   because this Messiah that we've been prophesying,
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.800]   in fact, if you read any of the prophets,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.400]   majority of the prophets are pretty dark,
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.300]   it's pretty depressing.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.200]   You think I'm depressing, they're much more depressing.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.400]   If you read the prophets,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.800]   almost every prophet is warning the nation of Israel,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   judgment is coming, judgment is coming.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.900]   Those of you who've been studying Isaiah with us,
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.300]   we're in chapter 9 now, it's 9 chapters of judgment.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.300]   And we have about 40 chapters to go, right, of judgment.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.600]   And in between we're going to have some hope
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.800]   about the coming Messiah,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.600]   but majority of it is about judgment
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.800]   coming to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.400]   Go to Ezekiel, it's no different.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.800]   Jeremiah, it's no different.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.600]   But the glimmer of hope that we see in all the prophecies
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.800]   is that in the midst of God declaring judgment,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.400]   He says, "But God will not stay angry forever.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.200]   He's going to send His chosen one.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.900]   He's going to send the Messiah,
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.000]   and on that day..."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   So what I read to you are three verses
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.600]   out of hundreds of verses that I could have chosen
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.700]   that the nation of Israel was clinging onto for dear life.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.300]   John the Baptist, it says in John 1, 6, 7,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.800]   "There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.400]   He came as a witness to bear witness about the light
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.300]   that all might believe through him.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.400]   He was not the light,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.000]   but came to bear witness about the light."
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.200]   Jesus says of John the Baptist, Matthew 11, 11,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.000]   "Among them that are born of women,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.300]   there has not risen a greater man than John the Baptist."
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.700]   Just think about that.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.000]   Think about how exaggerated of a statement that may sound.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.300]   What do you know about John the Baptist?
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.300]   He wore strange clothes, had a strange belt.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.500]   He lived out in the wilderness,
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.700]   and he liked to be in the water.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.300]   I mean, what do you know about John the Baptist?
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.400]   That he'd say, think about who he's talking about.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.000]   He's talking about greater than Abraham.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.100]   Greater than Abraham?
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.600]   Abraham left everything.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.800]   He was a rich man in the world of Chaldeans,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.500]   walked out into the desert,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.500]   risking his life because he believed in God.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.600]   He was willing to sacrifice his own son.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.300]   The only way that the promise of God
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.100]   could be fulfilled through his son,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.000]   he was willing to sacrifice that to God.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.900]   And Jesus says, "John the Baptist is greater than him."
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.100]   Oh, come on.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.200]   Greater than Abraham?
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.800]   He's greater than Moses.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.500]   Moses lived in 40 years out in the desert,
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.000]   leading a million people,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.300]   complaining every time they got hungry,
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.900]   every time they got thirsty.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.800]   40 years he led these people.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.400]   And he didn't volunteer for it.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.500]   God chose him.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.600]   And at the end of his life, because he hits the rock,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.900]   and he misrepresents God,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.600]   he doesn't get to go to the Promised Land.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.200]   And he's probably the greatest leader
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.700]   that Israel has ever had.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.600]   And Jesus says, "John the Baptist is greater."
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.200]   I would think if Jesus said that,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.500]   I would say, "Wait a minute.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.200]   Are you really saying what I think you're saying?"
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.000]   Well, that's what he said.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.400]   I mean, if anybody else said it,
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.500]   I'd say, "Oh, okay, he's not talking the truth."
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.600]   Jesus said that.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.000]   What made John the Baptist greater than everybody else?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   We don't know,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.000]   because the Bible doesn't describe his childhood.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.100]   It doesn't describe much.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.400]   All we are told is,
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   John the Baptist came to prepare the way
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.600]   for Jesus to come.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.600]   The only thing that I could think of
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.800]   that makes John the Baptist greater than anybody else
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   is the proximity to Christ.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.700]   He was the very last prophet to be sent
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.700]   to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.700]   We know that he was a cousin of Jesus,
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.600]   was born six months earlier.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.400]   And again, we don't know a whole lot,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.200]   but his whole ministry was to go prepare.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.000]   Jesus is coming.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.300]   The Kingdom of Heaven is coming.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   Prepare.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.000]   Now, how did he spend his time preparing?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.700]   He didn't go and decorate.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700]   You know, "Go decorate your house,
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.400]   because the Messiah is coming."
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.500]   So when he comes, it will be festive.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.500]   It's like we have the President of the United States
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.200]   coming into, you know, whatever,
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.400]   and then you clean up the streets
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.600]   and put the lights up so they know.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.400]   He doesn't do any of that, right?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.300]   He didn't say, "Hey, prepare for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.300]   You know, go read your Old Testament verses
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.800]   and make sure that you know these verses."
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.000]   Again, none of these things in and of itself
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.600]   is wrong or God is displeased with.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.300]   But that was not his primary message.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.100]   His primary message to prepare them
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.500]   was to repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.800]   The thing that you've been waiting for,
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   for 600, 700 years to come,
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.600]   and it's about to come,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.800]   and the way that you need to prepare is to repent.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.600]   If you notice, if his message was to prepare the way
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.800]   for the Messiah, you would think,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   we would think the natural thing to do is go to the Temple,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.000]   because that's where the Bible is being taught.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.600]   That's where the people were being discipled.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.800]   That's where the rabbis hung out.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.000]   So you would go there and you would discuss with them,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.600]   because that's where the religious people were gathered.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.800]   Instead, he goes out to the wilderness of Judah,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   and he's living like a homeless guy.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.500]   And I'm not sure exactly what drew people to him,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.800]   because it doesn't talk about any miracles.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.600]   He wasn't out there healing people.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   We don't hear about miracles of John the Baptist.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.500]   He was just a strange guy out in the wilderness.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.300]   Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   and I baptize you as baptism of repentance.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.100]   And hundreds of people, thousands of people
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.400]   are coming out to the wilderness.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.700]   What was it about John that people were so intrigued
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.600]   that even the leaders of Israel left their Temple,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.200]   their comfort zone, and went out to see him?
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.800]   I think it was something about John
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.500]   that they recognized in Jesus, they recognized in John.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.200]   He didn't speak like the other Pharisees.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.700]   He didn't speak like the other scribes.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   There was a kind of authority in him,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.300]   because the Holy Spirit anointed him.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.500]   And he was preaching repentance.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.100]   Prepare for the coming of the Messiah by repenting.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.600]   See, the Temple itself was the problem.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.900]   Part of the problem why people were not able
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.400]   to receive the Messiah is because
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   of what was happening at the Temple.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.000]   Worship at that time became a ritual.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   It was just something that you did
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.800]   because it was something that they've always done.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.300]   You just do it, because that's what good,
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.100]   faithful worshipers of God do.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.300]   It was mainly done so that they can see,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.000]   it's like, "Oh, I went."
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.700]   Kind of like us, like you go to church,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.600]   and if you don't go to church,
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.900]   people are going to ask, "Where were you?"
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.700]   And so on, that's, "I got to go."
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's not the only reason,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.500]   but a lot of what we do sometimes
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.100]   is because that's the expectations of people.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.300]   Well, that was the Temple worship.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.900]   They did it for themselves to be seen by other men.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.400]   And then the worst part of it is
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.900]   that they used the outer court
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.100]   where the women and the Gentiles were supposed to come,
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.600]   that they converted, and they were selling,
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.800]   and they were bartering things in there
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.900]   so that they couldn't worship.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.800]   They made it a den of robbers instead of a place of prayer.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   So the only place where we see Jesus
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.000]   absolutely lose it is at the Temple.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.500]   He started his ministry by cleansing the Temple,
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.900]   and then he ended his ministry by cleansing his Temple.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.700]   And he was making a point.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.200]   What is happening in this Temple is not pleasing to God.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.500]   And that's why John the Baptist,
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.300]   he doesn't come to prepare the religious people.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.800]   He goes out to the wilderness,
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.200]   and he calls out the sinners to himself.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.000]   In fact, when the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.500]   and the priests started to come to him,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.400]   remember what he said?
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.600]   "You brood of vipers,
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.200]   bear fruit in accordance to your repentance."
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.700]   Your repentance is not genuine.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.600]   He says to repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.100]   It's coming.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.700]   And the only way that you're going to be able to recognize it
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.600]   is if you repent.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.200]   You know, some of the songs that we sing,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.600]   like the Christmas songs that we sing,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.000]   and sometimes we sing it when we're young,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.900]   and we don't really think about the lyrics.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.500]   I want to go over one of the lyrics to you.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.100]   It says, "You better watch out.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.400]   You better not cry.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.300]   You better not pout, and I'm telling you why.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.200]   Santa Claus is coming to town."
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.700]   He's making a list, checking it twice,
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.000]   going to find out who's naughty or nice.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.900]   Santa Claus is coming to town.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.600]   He sees you when you're sleeping.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.300]   He knows you when you're awake.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.700]   He knows if you've been bad or good,
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.200]   so be good for goodness sake.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   So you better watch out.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.000]   So you better not cry.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.900]   You better not pout, because I'm telling you why.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.900]   This is a song that we learn when we're little kids,
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.900]   and we sing it, we don't really think much about it,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:21.600]   but it's absolute heresy.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.200]   Don't say that to the children, you know.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.600]   They go to school and say, "This is heresy, teacher."
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.000]   Basically what this song says is,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.600]   "You better get your act straight."
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   Because if you're not perfect, if you're not doing these things,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.000]   the problem with this song is,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.100]   He knows those who are naughty and nice.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.900]   But the problem is, if the Messiah was coming,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.300]   if God was coming to judge between right and wrong,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.900]   and say, "All the good people stand here,
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.500]   all the bad people stand over here,"
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.600]   we would all be in big trouble.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.200]   We would all be in big trouble.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.400]   The Scripture clearly says that we are all naughty.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.800]   That we're all naughty.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.100]   And so, if you look at the book of Romans
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.200]   that we've been studying, right, for three chapters,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.400]   for three chapters, Paul's been preparing
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:18.200]   the Jews in Rome to be introduced to Christ.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.400]   Three chapters.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.200]   He's preparing a foundation so that he can say,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.400]   "Here's Jesus."
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.800]   So basically, in a nutshell, what Paul is doing
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.400]   in the book of Romans, the first three chapters,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.500]   is exactly what John the Baptist is doing.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.800]   He's preparing the way for Christ.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.300]   He's calling people to himself.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.800]   In fact, Acts 19.4, when Paul describes
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.300]   John the Baptist's ministry, he says,
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.800]   Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   telling the people to believe in the One
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.300]   Jesus Himself said," Luke 19.10,
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.700]   "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.000]   He didn't come to distinguish between good or bad,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.700]   because we were all bad.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.000]   He came to seek the lost.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.200]   Matthew 9.12-13.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.000]   When these Pharisees said, "Why are you spending
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.600]   all your time with these tax collectors and these sinners?"
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.800]   Jesus says to them, "Those who are well
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.400]   have no need of a physician, but those who are sick,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.200]   go and learn what this means.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.100]   I desire mercy and not sacrifice.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.200]   For I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners."
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.400]   John the Baptist was preparing the way
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.800]   for the Messiah to come, because without repentance,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.900]   you will not recognize Him.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.000]   And everyone who was unrepentant,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.700]   when the Messiah came, they saw, of course they saw Him.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.800]   They saw the miracles.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   Many of them ate the miraculous bread.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.100]   But when Jesus came, not only did they reject Him,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.000]   many of them crucified Him.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.800]   They were that blind.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.900]   So the way that John the Baptist and Paul
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.700]   is preparing the way to receive and see the Messiah
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.600]   is to call them to repentance.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   See, 2 Corinthians 4.4, as you guys know,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.800]   it says, "The God of this age
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.200]   has blinded the minds of the unbelievers
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.300]   to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.400]   What authority does Satan have over the world
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.300]   that he is able to keep their eyes blind?
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.900]   And I think you and I know the answer to that.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.800]   It's sin.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.500]   Sin is what blinds us to God.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.800]   Sin is what causes people to come to religious festivities,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.000]   come to worship week after week, hear the gospel.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.700]   We can dissect the gospel.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.800]   We can talk about the glories of Christ,
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.300]   and you just don't see it.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.900]   You don't get it.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.700]   You can hear the message week after week,
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.800]   year after year, and never see the glory
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.500]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.100]   Because once you see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.300]   you will change.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.000]   You will change.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.700]   It's just like if you've tasted something good,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.500]   you want more of it.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.300]   The fact that there is no appetite for the things of God
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.900]   may be a sign that you have not seen,
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.800]   that you may still be blind.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.000]   In Matthew 5, verse 8,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.900]   Jesus gives a sermon at the mount,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.300]   and on the message of the sermon at the mount,
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.300]   he talks about how to enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.000]   And in that sermon at the mount, the Beatitudes,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.600]   one of the things that he said is,
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.900]   "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.800]   In other words, if your heart is not pure,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.600]   you are blind.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.400]   He didn't say, "Blessed are those who learn."
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.300]   He didn't say, "Blessed are those who know theology."
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.400]   He didn't say, "Blessed are those who do good things."
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.300]   He said, "Blessed are those who are pure in heart,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.600]   for they shall see God."
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.100]   See, if Jesus is coming, and he's the Son of God,
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.000]   he's going to do fantastic things.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.500]   But to be able to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.400]   to see who he is,
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.100]   he says, "Your heart must be pure."
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   So John the Baptist was preparing their heart
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.500]   to make it fertile, so when Jesus came,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.300]   and he preached about the kingdom of God,
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.500]   that they would recognize him.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.000]   Hebrews 12, verse 14,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "Strive for peace with everyone, and for holiness.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.100]   Without it, no one will see the Lord."
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.200]   If there is sin that we compromise,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.700]   if there is sin that we justify,
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.900]   "Well, you know, why did you eat that?"
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.100]   And you say, "Oh, it's the woman that you put into the garden."
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.500]   "Why did you eat that?"
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.300]   "Oh, it's the serpent that you put in the garden."
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.600]   Any sin that you try to justify
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   cannot be justified by God.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Any sin that we compromise and we justify for ourselves
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.400]   cannot be justified by God.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   Because justification comes
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.500]   when we recognize that we have no ability to justify our sins.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.600]   And we come and repent.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.100]   And we recognize who we are.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.000]   What prevents us from seeing the glimpse of the glory of the gospel,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.700]   which changes us,
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.100]   is because we constantly make excuses for our sins.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   We make excuses why we are the way we are.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.400]   We make excuses for the impurity.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.700]   We make excuses for the way that we live.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.500]   It's because of our society.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.700]   It's because of the way we live.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.300]   It's because of life being hard.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.700]   But any excuse that we make,
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.300]   any sin that we justify,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:38.000]   will prevent us from seeing Christ as He is.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.700]   John 1, 9-10.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.600]   "The true light which enlightens everyone
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.800]   was coming into the world."
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.400]   "He was in the world,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.100]   and the world was made through Him,
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   yet the world did not know Him."
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.200]   Can you imagine the tragedy of this verse?
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.000]   That their own Maker has come into the world.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.500]   It wasn't just the Messiah.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.400]   It wasn't just about some kingdom and Israel being restored.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.900]   It was their Maker.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.200]   Stood in front of them.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   Fed them.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.300]   Healed them.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.800]   Preached to them.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.300]   And they didn't recognize Him.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.100]   You know, I think one of the harshest diseases
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.100]   or sickness to deal with in life is Alzheimer.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.100]   You know, the older I get, I hear more and more about it.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.100]   And you hear stories about how, you know,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   husband and wife, and the wife or the husband
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.500]   gets Alzheimer in the last 15, 20 years.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.400]   They don't recognize their own wife.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.000]   They don't recognize their own children.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.700]   You know, it's part of living in this fallen world,
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.500]   but that's the reality.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   I can't imagine waking up one day
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   and seeing my children that I love,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.300]   and, "Who are you?"
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.500]   Or vice versa, coming down, you know,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   try to give them a hug, and like, "Who are you?"
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.700]   And treating me like a stranger,
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:06.300]   because they don't recognize me, or my wife, or my family.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.700]   He says that was a tragedy
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.900]   of when Jesus came into the world as a light,
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.600]   and everything was made by Him, for Him, sustained by Him,
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.500]   and they did not recognize Him.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   What caused them to be this blind?
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.600]   See, in the Scripture, the sinful state
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.900]   is often described as blindness, right?
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.900]   The greatest deception is you think you see
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.400]   when you don't see, right?
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   You think, like, "Oh, I see a cliff, and I see a bridge,
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.900]   and there's no bridge there," right?
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.400]   That's a dangerous place to be.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.900]   He says sin is what's causing us
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.500]   to not be able to see the glimpse of God.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.400]   Why is seeing God so important?
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.200]   And why is repentance so important
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.400]   so that we may see who God is?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   Because when we see Him, we change.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.600]   We change.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.200]   1 John 3, 2, it says, "Beloved, we are God's children now,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.600]   and what we will be has not yet appeared.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.900]   But we know that when He appears,
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:17.400]   we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is."
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   Why will we become like Him?
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.900]   What causes us to be glorified with Him?
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.200]   He says, "When you see Him."
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.400]   When you see Him as He is, He says, "You shall be like Him."
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.600]   And the reason why we only see traces or glimpses of it
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.200]   is because we're wrestling with sin.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.400]   But one day, when we are glorified,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   and all of sin, inside and out, is dealt with,
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.000]   He said, "We will see Him as He is,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.500]   and when that happens, you will change."
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.400]   1 Corinthians 13, 12,
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.300]   Now I know in part, then I shall know Him fully,
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.600]   even as I have been fully known."
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:02.000]   Right now, we're seeing dimly, through a dimly lit mirror.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.400]   And so everything that we are seeing of Christ
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.100]   is just bits and pieces.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.100]   And so, what John the Baptist is doing is,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.600]   the Messiah is going to come,
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.900]   but if you're going to recognize Him, you have to repent.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.200]   You have to own up to your sins.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.000]   And not superficial like the Pharisees,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.300]   who were confessing one thing, and doing something else.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.600]   He says, "If you want to see God, you must repent.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.700]   You must own up to the sin that is internal.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.300]   You must own up to the compromises that you make.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   You must own up to everything that you say,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.800]   'Well, I'm doing it because of them.'"
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.600]   Do you spend more time
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.000]   frustrated with the sins of other people than yours?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.200]   Do you spend more time
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.800]   hoping, and maybe even praying,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.100]   that other people around you will change,
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.800]   so that you can change?
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.700]   Is that any different than Adam saying,
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.200]   "Well, I sinned because of that woman that you sent."
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.000]   C.S. Lewis describes his vision,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.100]   his growing vision of Christ.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.900]   And as a Christian, so I'm going to read it,
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.000]   and I'm going to explain a little bit,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.800]   because I had to read it several times
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.300]   for me to really understand what he was saying.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.200]   But this is what he says.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.100]   And this is about his experience,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.900]   about a growing glimpse of the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.000]   He says, "Up until now, each visitation of joy
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.200]   had left the common world momentarily a desert."
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.700]   Let me explain that, ok?
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.800]   So if you get it, ok, you're an A student.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.400]   So if you don't get it, you're like me, ok?
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.600]   Basically what he is saying is
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.700]   every time he had this spiritual encounter,
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.400]   like he went to a revival or whatever,
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.900]   every time he experienced this visitation of joy,
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.100]   the common world momentarily became a desert.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.500]   In other words, it became rubbish.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.900]   It's just, I just, the more I experienced God,
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.200]   the less I wanted of this world.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.000]   Basically that's what he is saying.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.600]   "Even when real clouds or trees were in my vision,
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.800]   they have been so only by reminding me of another world."
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.200]   So even when I saw the beauty of creation,
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.400]   he said it reminded me, like,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.700]   "Oh, one day I want to be in Heaven."
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.000]   "And I did not want to return to ours."
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.600]   In other words, it became harder and harder
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.200]   to want to live here.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   But he says, "But,
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.500]   but now I saw the bright shadow of holiness
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.300]   coming out of the book into the real world."
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.200]   In other words,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.800]   the Word of God was beginning to affect him.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.000]   That it was coming into the real world
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.300]   and resting there.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.700]   Instead of comparing,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.200]   he said that the holiness
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.800]   that was resonating from the Scripture
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.000]   was coming out,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.900]   and it was resting there,
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.800]   transforming all common things
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.900]   and yet itself unchanged.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.900]   Instead of now looking at,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.000]   "Look how beautiful things in Heaven,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.300]   or God is, and the future will be,
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.000]   and how bad the creation is."
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.300]   He says now,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.200]   that the Word of God, the holiness,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.000]   is coming out and is transforming everything.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.500]   Everything common began to change for me.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.900]   Or more accurately,
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.100]   "I saw the common things drawn
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   into the bright shadow."
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.000]   Did you understand that?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.500]   In other words, it wasn't no longer
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.800]   just a comparison between
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.300]   what I'm going to have in Heaven
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.100]   and then this nasty place that we live.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.900]   He said, "No."
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.600]   He said, "The holy things that I was seeing
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.100]   opened my eyes to see the beauty
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.700]   of His creation."
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.400]   A more simple way that he put it,
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.600]   he says, "I believe in Christianity
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.300]   as I believe that the Son has risen.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   Not only because I see it,
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.700]   but because by it I see everything else."
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.400]   Why is seeing God,
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.000]   the ability to see our Creator,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.900]   why is it so important?
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.700]   Because until we see
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.900]   the glory of our Father,
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.500]   everything else is tainted.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.900]   Seeing God causes us to see everything else
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.700]   the way God intended.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.700]   And until our eyes get open
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.100]   to see our Savior,
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.800]   and I'm not just talking about understanding,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.200]   I'm not just talking about reading,
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.600]   I'm talking about He illuminates us.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.100]   Because the barrier between us and God
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.400]   is taken away,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.000]   and we repent and He forgives us,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.200]   and we have this free access,
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   and we are seeing His glory.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.600]   It changes everything.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.700]   You know, the story of Job
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.600]   is a heart-wrenching story.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.500]   But the conclusion of Job,
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.900]   if you do not know Christ,
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.900]   will make no sense to you.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.200]   Because here's a man who was righteous.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   He's chosen because he's righteous.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.900]   Satan and God has a conversation.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.000]   He says, "If you take away this hedge of protection,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.900]   let me at it, and he's going to curse you and die."
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.200]   So God says, "Okay, I trust."
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.500]   And then He takes it away,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.000]   and then all these horrific things happen.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.300]   He loses his children.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.000]   He has the worst health possible.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.600]   And then the worst part of it is,
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   after all that has happened,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.400]   the rest of the book of Job
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.200]   is his friends coming
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.700]   in three separate cycles.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.600]   He says, "You know what?
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.100]   This doesn't happen to righteous people.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.100]   You must have done something wrong."
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.300]   And Job is like,
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.700]   "What could I have possibly done?"
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.500]   He says, "There's no way. God is just.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.300]   God will not allow this injustice
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.100]   to happen to a righteous person.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.900]   So there must be some kind of sin
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.200]   that you're hiding from us."
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   And then one guy is done.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.100]   The next guy would come.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.100]   He's like, "He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.300]   Let me tell you what's going on."
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.900]   Right?
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.700]   It may not be you.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.700]   It's probably your grandparents.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.800]   It's your grandparents.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.000]   It's some ancestors.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.600]   "You must have done something wrong."
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.300]   So they go through three cycles.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.900]   And then he's like, "Oh my gosh.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.600]   I got the best friends in the world."
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.700]   And then they come back again.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.800]   Right?
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.400]   And there's three separate cycles of this.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.200]   Four, 45 plus chapters.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.400]   They're coming and say,
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.000]   "This is happening to you because of your problem."
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.300]   Can you imagine that?
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.500]   The worst horrendous thing
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.700]   that you can possibly think of.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.000]   And then you're looking for friendship
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.200]   and some, you know, some sympathy.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.500]   And they said,
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.200]   "Well, you probably deserved it."
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.100]   [Laughter]
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.100]   And he's arguing with them.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.900]   He's like, "No!"
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.400]   And then God shows up at the end.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:07.700]   Right?
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.300]   God shows up at the end.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.200]   And when God shows up,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.900]   right, this is the part that's hard to understand.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.000]   If you're not a Christian.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.700]   If you've never seen God.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.300]   God doesn't answer the question.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.100]   Because all throughout his life,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.700]   you're, they're trying to answer,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.000]   "Why is this happening?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.400]   Why does tragic things happen?
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.700]   Why does God allow this?"
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.500]   And so you would think,
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.700]   "You guys are all dummies.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.800]   You guys are all wrong."
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.000]   And finally when God shows up,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.700]   you say, "This is why this happened."
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.300]   Never answers.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.400]   God shows up and he says,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.000]   "Pull up your pants."
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Right?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.500]   "Pull up your pants and take it like a man."
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:44.800]   Right?
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.100]   That's basically what he says in my translation.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.300]   He says, "Pull up your pants.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.200]   Take it like a man."
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.100]   And then all he does, he says,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.400]   "Do you know who I am?"
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.700]   That's basically, in a nutshell,
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.600]   that's what he says.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.400]   "Who are you?
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.600]   Do you know who I am?"
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   And so you're reading that.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.300]   It's like, "Wait a second.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.200]   I missed something."
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:06.900]   Right?
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.600]   Where's the answer?
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:08.800]   Right?
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.500]   Here's the answer.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.100]   There is no answer.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.100]   That's all he says.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.300]   "Do you know who I am?
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.400]   Do you know who I am?"
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.300]   He says that over and over, basically.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.500]   At the conclusion of that,
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.800]   you would think Job would say,
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.300]   "Oh, man, forget this.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.100]   I'm not worshipping God anymore.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.000]   This is what I get?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.300]   This is what I get for worshipping God?
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.900]   I lose all my children, my wealth, my health,
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.300]   and then these friends?"
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   Right?
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.400]   And then he doesn't even answer.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.000]   He doesn't give me a solution to this.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.100]   But his response tells everything.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.900]   He says in Job 42, 5-6,
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.800]   "I had heard of you by hearing of the ear.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.000]   All this time, I heard
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.500]   because people were telling me about you.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.300]   I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.400]   but now my eyes see you.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.900]   Therefore, I despise myself
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.600]   and repent in dust and ashes."
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.300]   In other words, he's saying, "I'm done."
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.100]   You know, we want logical conclusion,
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.500]   logical answers.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.500]   But the answer was God showed up.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.400]   When God showed up, it was okay.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.200]   When God showed up, he forgets.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.400]   When God shows up and he sees God,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.000]   "I heard of you, but now I've seen you."
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.900]   And he has the same response as Isaiah,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   "I am done.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.200]   I am unworthy of you."
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.300]   That's his response.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.900]   He doesn't say, "God, you're not worthy of my praise."
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.100]   He doesn't say that.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.300]   He says, "I'm not worthy of you."
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.900]   See, salvation happens when God opens our eyes
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.400]   and we see Christ.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.800]   Isn't that why you come here every single week?
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   Isn't that why you bought a Bible?
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.600]   Isn't that why you put up with difficult people?
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   Because you've seen the glory of Christ
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.200]   and you want more.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.800]   And why would anybody want to go to heaven
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.900]   if you don't want Christ?
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.000]   See, the story of Job will not make any sense
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.500]   to a non-Christian.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.000]   But every single one of you here,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.500]   if God opened your eyes even just a little bit
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.900]   and you've tasted and you've seen
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.800]   who Christ is,
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.900]   this is why we come.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.900]   This is why we persevere.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.000]   And this is why we change.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.400]   That's why Jesus says, "I am the way,
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.900]   I am the truth, and I am the life.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.700]   And nobody comes to the Father but through me."
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.400]   He says, "Prepare the way for the Lord.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.600]   Make His path straight."
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.200]   How are we going to pursue Christ?
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.600]   How are we going to make this path straight
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.700]   so that we may have a clearer vision of our Savior
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.400]   and be changed?
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.000]   I pray that the next couple weeks that we have,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.200]   that it's not just something that we think about,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.600]   we talk about,
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.500]   but we make a decision that I'm going to pursue Christ
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.200]   tangibly.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.000]   How will we prepare for His coming?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.300]   He says, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.700]   Would you take a minute to pray with me
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.200]   as we again welcome the praise team to come up?
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.100]   And I'm going to read a psalm for you,
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.900]   and I pray that this would be our prayer,
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.800]   not only today, but as we think about Christmas
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:44.200]   and as we think about the preparation of the coming Messiah.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.200]   In Psalm 139, and I pray that this would be our prayer,
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   and I encourage you to pray this after I read this.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   It says, "O Lord, You have searched me and known me.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.500]   You know when I sit down, when I rise up.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.900]   You discern my thoughts from afar.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.400]   You search out my path and my lying down,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.700]   and are acquainted with all my ways.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.800]   Even before a word is on my tongue,
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   behold, O Lord, You know altogether."
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.600]   And verse 23 says, "Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.400]   Try me and know my thoughts,
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.900]   and see if there be any grievous way in me,
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.200]   and lead me in the way everlasting."
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.400]   Let's take some time to pray
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.300]   and make that a sincere prayer that we offer up to God.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   Let's pray.
