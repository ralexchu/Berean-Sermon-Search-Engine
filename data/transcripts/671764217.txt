[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Good morning, church family.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.020]   My name is Yigao, generally referred as Holly.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.800]   By God's grace, I'm grateful to stand here today to reflect on my walk with Christ and
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.520]   testify my faith through baptism.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.280]   I grew up in a secular family with a secular education, secular friends in China.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.320]   In 2014 in Beijing, when I was 17, I was invited to a family church by my best friend from
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.600]   school.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.400]   Seeing the genuine love and care people of my age had for one another, as well as from
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.280]   the Sunday school teachers, I felt at peace and felt truly at home than anywhere else.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   The next year, I publicly shared my testimony in front of the church family.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.160]   I received sprinkling over my head as a professing believer.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.760]   Before my sprinkling ceremony, when I heard the choir singing, "Because he lives, I can
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.320]   face tomorrow," I cried because for the first time of my life, I had hope.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   At that time, I wasn't aware of the different modes of baptism and its biblical significance.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.960]   My understanding of God began there, but with very little understanding of who he was and
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.160]   who I was called to be.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.400]   I struggled with sins and with securing my hope in Christ.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.960]   From 2015, I went on a lengthy detour in my spiritual life.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.320]   I went to Sweden to pursue my undergraduate studies.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.640]   However, without much understanding from the Bible, my faith was not deeply rooted in the
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640]   word.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.000]   Therefore, I couldn't distinguish how a healthy Bible believing, Christ-following church should
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.500]   be like.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.520]   After two years at a secular church, God used different people and his own word to reveal
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.840]   my limited understanding of who he truly is.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.380]   In 2017, I encountered a Chinese sister with a rather solid church background.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.080]   In January 2018, we left the secular church and started fasting and praying together with
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.740]   intensive Bible studies and Bible reading.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.360]   To repent and flee from sins to the Lord, I was craving for and savoring the sweetness
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.480]   of his word, of all his grace and love, forgiveness and holiness.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.000]   As a child, clinging with all her strength to a string of life, I started understanding
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.520]   the depth of my sins and my need for salvation through Christ.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.640]   In particular, the sermon series on the holiness of God from Paul Washer revealed God's holiness
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.600]   and justice in the Bible drastically different from my totally deprived nature.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.040]   Therefore, I understood my desperate need for salvation and holiness because he is holy.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.920]   The Spirit opened my eyes and heart to grasp and believe in good news presented in the
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.080]   Bible and revealed my self-centered sins that he hated.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.160]   I repented from my rebellion against God and believed that my sins are forgiven through
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   my professing faith in Jesus Christ, confessing him as the Lord and Savior of my life with
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.000]   my mouth and heart.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.640]   By God's grace, he saved me from dominion of sin, leading to the condemnation of hell
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.320]   on the judgment day.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.080]   Christ's precious blood shed on the cross as a ransom justified me so that I am saved
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.760]   from God's wrath and could stand blameless before God in the last time.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.280]   My relationship with God has now been restored and I have received the promised Holy Spirit
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.080]   and eternal life in him.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.040]   According to his great mercy, he has caused me to be born again to a living hope through
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, crucifying my old self.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   I no longer seek to live in my own ways but to obey his will and be an imitator of Christ.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.600]   Therefore, I believe that I am saved and will not be put to shame because he is faithful.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.240]   I now have the confidence in my salvation because my eternal relationship with God has
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.760]   been restored and secured through my faith alone in Christ alone by God's grace alone.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.680]   Because Sweden has very few Bible-believing churches, I moved to a different city to join
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.720]   Bible-teaching church.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.000]   Along the way, God used Berean through the China mission team since our meeting in 2014
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   in China.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.120]   Through fellowships, Bible studies, and online resources, God grew and led me until today.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:39.680]   I am very grateful to be able to pursue my graduate studies here at USC and all the more
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.280]   to be here at Berean to serve and be served for the building of his church, the body of
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.360]   Christ.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.000]   so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.720]   into his marvelous light.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.800]   For you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.200]   You have not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.640]   First Peter 2.9.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.600]   Since immersion expresses our death in the flesh and our new life in Christ's resurrection,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.280]   I would like to be baptized today through immersion.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   Thank you.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   [Applause]
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   [Applause]
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   [Applause]
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   [Applause]
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   [Applause]
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.560]   [Applause]
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   [Applause]
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   [Applause]
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   [Applause]
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.060]   (applause)
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:15.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
