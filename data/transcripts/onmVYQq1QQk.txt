[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with one big huge or love you bet I the queen of
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.680]   I cannot believe what J.K. has pulled off here
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.940]   Witnessing our first Theranos moment. I got great news. I took all the money I put in Luna
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.160]   From an undisclosed location. Mr. Elon Musk
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.720]   People actually fucking listen to us talking over zoom way more work than I thought I was signing up for
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.880]   I want to talk about a lot of stuff that's broken right now that we know how to fix but we aren't
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.200]   Bad customer service and health care the defense industry in America is fundamentally broken
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.480]   There's no doubt that it's a left-wing monoculture that's suppressing ideas and someone needs to fix that that these
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.600]   Prestige outlets like the New York Times have so much credibility in our culture
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.640]   They have the power to destroy people's careers what went wrong that this would happen
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.000]   Journalism has adjusted we've gone from being
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.480]   people whose primary job is to be curious about why things happen to being
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.920]   Advocates a government shouldn't be running a hundred billion dollar surplus. It's not a for-profit organization. No
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.360]   The obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed more money than it had
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.920]   Because so many people just want a yes or no answer. They want to say this is the future this isn't they don't want to
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.720]   Think about a distribution of outcomes, which is really the way the world works
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.600]   Let me just start by saying that investing is really fucking hard
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   [Applause]
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:59.760]   So we get to approach these problems but often the solution is east meets west
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.160]   For women to believe in themselves we make amazing founders people who are true
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.920]   Entrepreneurs I think at scale and think and think very very big we're very much into freedom here in Miami
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.800]   And we try to facilitate people's growth and success. That's it. That's all we do. I think sometimes
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.560]   We have to think very deeply about
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.280]   The suffering people have had especially when it's different than the suffering that you and I have had
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.640]   Yeah
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080]   If you remember your physics velocity has a direction and sometimes going really really fast is actually negative
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.160]   Velocity because you're going the wrong way. I mean I get trashed by media all the time. It's fine
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.560]   I don't care but it's indicative of the fact that even though I have like a lot of resources
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.200]   I do not actually have the ability to stop the media from trashing me and that's actually a good thing
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.480]   Well, you just broke the fucking internet with Elon. He was in a great mood. Yeah, I was
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.700]   He likes hanging with his besties like say when does prestige matter most it's when someone you don't like saying something
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.440]   You don't like what drives the country forward
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.400]   This is what drives knowledge forward is people able to disagree Russia isn't aggressive because it's surrounded by NATO
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.960]   It's surrounded by NATO because it's aggressive but to sacrifice Ukraine in pursuit of this broader geopolitical for him
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.400]   It was a game. It was his show and for me, of course everything I love not a coward
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.560]   You can take me on straight up as a man. I appreciate it
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.160]   You just kind of have to say like fuck you and move on with your life
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.040]   If you're sitting on excess liquidity right now and want to invest for a long time
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.720]   Was that a transition from war three to?
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.240]   The best way to protect yourself against the downside is to enjoy every last bit of the upside and now we have inflation
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.200]   But we also have lots of business formation and we have new ways of doing work
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.760]   The trends that existed for 20 years
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.520]   Still exist that inflation will roll over so I'm willing to underwrite to that
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.120]   There is going to be a big beautiful bull market in real stuff and it is just beginning
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.920]   Best entrepreneurs are incredible storytellers as a way of attracting the best talent and then as a way of attracting customers
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:19.320]   And I don't want to die without having used whatever influence I have to proselytize for ideas
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.240]   I believe in you need strong leadership companies are there to make products that people and organizations want to need not
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.520]   Necessarily to fight over political ideals the world's never gonna run out of new ideas for business software
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.360]   And there will always be an opportunity there for new companies
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.120]   But we cannot debate is how important it is that the United States win and that democracy wins and that freedom comes to all
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.120]   these countries
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120]   You
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   You
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   Thank you
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.920]   >> Hey you are coming, we'll see you next year.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.480]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
