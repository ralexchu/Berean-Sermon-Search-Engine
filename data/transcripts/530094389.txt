[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Okay, thank you.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:16.120]   If we can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 19.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.600]   I want to read Luke chapter 19, verse 28 through 44.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.400]   And then I'm not going to read it, but the text that we're going to be in this morning
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400]   is in Zechariah.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.560]   Okay, Luke chapter 19, verse 28 through 44.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.280]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.200]   After he had said these things, he was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.920]   When he approached Bethphage and Bethany near the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.680]   of the disciples saying, "Go into the village ahead of you.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.760]   There as you enter, you will find a coat tied on which no one yet has ever sat.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.120]   Untie it and bring it here.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?'
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.400]   You shall say, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.540]   So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.840]   As they were untying the coat, its owner said to them, 'Why are you untying the coat?'
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.880]   They said, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.120]   They brought it to Jesus and they threw their coats on the coat and put Jesus on it.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.780]   As he was going, they were spreading their coats on the road.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.760]   As soon as he was approaching near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.140]   the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.520]   they had seen, shouting, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.920]   Peace in heaven, glory in the highest.'
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.120]   Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, 'Teacher, rebuke your disciples.'
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.740]   But Jesus answered, 'I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out.'
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.680]   When he approached Jerusalem, he saw the city and wept over it, saying, 'If you had known
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.200]   in this day, even you, the things which make for peace, but now they have been hidden from
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   your eyes.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.440]   For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw a barricade against you
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.560]   and wrestle around you and hem you in every side.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.320]   And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.480]   leave in you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.'"
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   Let's pray.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.300]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.900]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to convict and lead us.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.540]   I pray that your word would make sense.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.140]   It would cause us, Lord God, to see the depth of your grace and love for us.
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.180]   Lord, as we begin this Passion Week with Palm Sunday, help us to understand what you were
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.340]   doing, what you are doing, that our hearts may be surrendered to you.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.860]   We pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.260]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.380]   As I've already said, this is a very busy week, probably the busiest week out of the
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.540]   whole year for us as a church because every single day we have something filled.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.300]   And so at the end of it, usually Sunday night, especially the pastoral staff and the leaders
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.380]   are pretty exhausted.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.300]   And I'm sure you guys are exhausted.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.700]   Sunday morning, we wake up early in the morning, give our devotion, and then there's a lot
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.260]   of things going on this week.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.620]   And the reason why we do this every year is because our natural tendency is to drift.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.220]   You know, the whole thing that we've been talking about in Hebrews is because our natural
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.220]   tendency is we get caught up and tangled with, you know, everyday things and raising children,
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.340]   paying bills, concerned about what's going on, whether it's political, economical.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.820]   And so our natural tendency is to just kind of drift from God.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.340]   So God tells the nation of Israel all these things that he plays, all these rituals and
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.220]   sacrifices and festivals in order to cause them to stop, break into their normal routine,
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.300]   and for them to remember what God has done because their natural tendency is to forget,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.900]   especially this year, right?
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.220]   Because the pandemic, you know, when we survey the church, when we survey what's going on
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.660]   outside the church, we hear a lot of people saying that they're fatigued, they're tired,
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.220]   they're distracted.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.540]   And I'm sure most of you are sick and tired of being on the Zoom.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.900]   You know, we're just waiting for us to get to, what is it, orange and then hopefully
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.140]   yellow soon, you know, and then whatever normal is to get back to normal so we don't have
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.380]   to be wearing these silly masks, you know, that we'd be done away with.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.180]   But in the midst of all that's been going on, and it's not just because of the pandemic,
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.460]   our natural tendency is when we are not striving after God, we don't drift toward God.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.220]   We don't sit there and get entangled and get busy and take care of our children and then
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.040]   wake up six months later, it's like, "Oh, I feel this passion for Christ."
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.620]   We don't drift toward God.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.540]   We drift away from God.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.960]   So if we're not deliberate about keeping our heart focused on Christ, if we're not deliberate
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.840]   about anchoring ourselves to Christ, we naturally have a tendency to drift.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.480]   And so these times are very important for us in order for us to renew our first love.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.940]   We can go through the rituals, like, "Yeah, I've been coming up to Bible study.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.240]   I haven't missed church, and I haven't missed this, and I haven't missed that."
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.980]   But again, our natural tendency is to the minimum.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.680]   We just kind of go through the motion.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.160]   We check out the box, but at the end, we find our hearts so hardened away from God, and
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.580]   sometimes we get so hardened that we even question, "Do I even believe this?"
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.720]   So we want to take this time this week, Monday through Friday, going over each day, and I
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.500]   hope that what you get out of it this week is not simply logically, "Oh, this is what
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.940]   happened in history.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.660]   This is what he did in the first day, second day, third day."
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.060]   Hopefully through each of these events that you recognize that Christ was deliberately
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.020]   walking toward the cross and how each one of these events led him to that point.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.260]   So that when we come and have communion on Friday, that communion, that we really have
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.700]   a rich understanding of what it is that we're participating, and we're hoping that by next
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.400]   Sunday when we come to celebrate Easter, that our singing would be louder than normal, right?
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.920]   That our praising will be louder than our usual way of singing, that hopefully it'll
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.940]   kind of cause us to be focused and to renew our first love toward Christ.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.700]   So today is Palm Sunday.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.020]   Palm Sunday is the kickoff of the day where Jesus is deliberately riding on his donkey
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.620]   headed toward Jerusalem.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.060]   And the reason why this is so significant is up to this point, Jesus was very, very
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.260]   quiet about his identity.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:44.580]   Even though the crescendo of excitement toward him has been growing and it's headed toward
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:52.700]   that place, his riding on the donkey was a very deliberate act where he's going to start
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.340]   the, you know, knock the first domino, and then each domino that, again, that's going
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.060]   to fall is going to ultimately lead him toward that cross.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:09.500]   You know, in the Bible, in the four Gospels, there's maybe about 10 to 12 major events
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.040]   that are recorded on all four Gospels.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.660]   So we know that every one of these events are extremely important because as you guys
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.420]   know, each one of these Gospels are different eyewitnesses, different testimonies, where
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.940]   you have Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John giving different, a Jewish angle, a Gentile angle,
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.100]   you know, Jesus's humanity angle, his deity angle.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.400]   And so each one of these angles highlight different aspects of Jesus's identity and
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.460]   what he has done.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.240]   That's why even though they're talking about the same life of Jesus, that you're going
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.720]   to hear different things.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.340]   So when something is repeated, you know it's important.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.740]   It was important enough that they all highlighted it.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.640]   The triumphal entry is one of those events, one of those dozen events that are highlighted.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.100]   But among, even among the same events, if you look at the four Gospels, you will notice
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.740]   that there are certain things that one person emphasizes and certain things that another
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.420]   person does not include.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.500]   This triumphal entry, even though they have, they talk about different angles, there's
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:14.120]   one event in the triumphal entry that is mentioned in detail in all four Gospels.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.440]   And that detail is Jesus getting the donkey and riding that donkey into Jerusalem.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.400]   So all the things that could have been highlighted in him coming into Jerusalem, telling his
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.460]   disciples to go get the donkey, and then to tell them, they're going to say, "Why are
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.460]   you taking my donkey?"
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.660]   He said, "Well, the Lord has need of it."
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.900]   And it's all okay.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.280]   That's recorded in all four Gospels.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.320]   So what is the significance of this donkey that is highlighted in this detail in all
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.420]   four Gospels?
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.820]   So what I want to go over this morning is to go over the three aspects that Jesus was
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.660]   declaring and he was fulfilling in the riding of the donkey.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.060]   There is, it is not some random event that takes place.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.440]   "Oh, he came into Jerusalem.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.540]   He just happened to be riding on a donkey."
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.540]   Right?
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.460]   No, there's something about this riding of the donkey that was highlighted for us that
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.820]   we are to take some time to examine carefully what is its significance.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.980]   So first one, why did he ride the donkey?
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.540]   Number one, Jesus rode the donkey to fulfill biblical prophecy.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.420]   In Zechariah 9, verse 9, it says, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.380]   Behold, your king is coming to you.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.860]   He is just and endowed with salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.740]   fold of a donkey."
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.320]   He was fulfilling that particular prophecy.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.980]   He was declaring to all the people who have gathered together, "I am that guy.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.180]   I am the Messiah."
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.860]   Up to this point, Jesus was very hush-hush about his identity.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.380]   Remember, every time he would fulfill some sort of miracle, he would tell his disciples
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.420]   to keep it quiet.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.620]   Remember the very first miracle of turning water into wine?
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.280]   Jesus tells his mother, "Why do you involve me?
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.380]   It is not my time."
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.580]   So up to this point, he would perform these miracles and people would say, "He must be.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.260]   He must be."
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.300]   But he never clearly said publicly to everybody that this is who he is.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.820]   He kind of kept it quiet because he knew once his identity came out, that the first domino
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.060]   falls that it's going to lead him directly to the cross.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.540]   But this prophecy of him riding on a donkey was not just in Zechariah.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:31.700]   In fact, even before that, all the way up to Genesis 49, verse 10 through 11, Jacob
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.860]   at the end of his life is giving blessing to his 12 children.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:41.100]   And in his blessing, he gets to Judah and he says this, "The scepter shall not depart
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.100]   from Judah."
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.020]   In other words, you're going to be a kingly line.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.540]   "Nor the ruler's staff between his feet until Shiloh comes."
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.060]   And Shiloh is in reference to the Messiah.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.020]   "And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.460]   He ties his fold to the vine and his donkey's coat to the choice vine.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.340]   He washes his garments in wine and his robes in the blood of grapes."
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.740]   Did you see that?
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.740]   Even as early as his blessing to Judah, it's clearly spelled out that when the Messiah
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.100]   comes, he's going to be riding on a donkey.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.600]   He's going to, again, talking about the vine and the wine, meaning his blood being spilled,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.380]   that he's going to come and to take his place.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.900]   So this was not new to the Jews.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.420]   They've been saying, "How are you going to recognize the Messiah?"
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.680]   Well, he's going to have the words of God.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.180]   He's going to perform some miracles.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:37.180]   But when you see a man coming into Jerusalem riding on a donkey, you know that that is
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.140]   going to be fulfilled.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.220]   So Jesus, for the first time in ministry, is publicly declaring to everybody there,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.100]   "I am that man."
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.460]   See, it was a very deliberate act.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.340]   What happens this week didn't happen to him.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.660]   It wasn't that he made some poor choices and maybe he shouldn't have cleansed the temple
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.580]   and he got the leaders angry and that's why they did that.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.980]   Maybe he shouldn't have chosen Judas and betrayed him.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.040]   Maybe he shouldn't have been praying out there at night.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.940]   It didn't happen to him.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.620]   Jesus says, by his own words, "No one takes my life.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.420]   I lay it down on my own accord and I take it up."
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.540]   He says he did it.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.540]   He planned to do it.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:29.380]   In fact, the Bible has over 300 different prophecies about Jesus' life, his disciples,
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.980]   his birth, the place of birth, betrayal, crucifixion, how he's going to be crucified, his resurrection,
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.340]   over 300 prophecies that were given in the Old Testament that Jesus fulfilled in his
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.940]   birth, life, ministry, death, and resurrection.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:52.820]   Meaning every part of what Jesus was doing was planned and was very deliberate.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:58.420]   In Numbers 23, verse 19, it says, "God is not man that he should lie, nor the son of
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.020]   man that he should repent.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:06.420]   Has he said and will he not do it, or has he spoken and will he not make it good?"
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.620]   Whenever you go on a job interview, you want to know, is he faithful?
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.780]   Can we rely on that person?
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.740]   Does he say what he says he's going to do?
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.300]   Or maybe you have friends or maybe you have people in your community who say, "If he says
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.420]   it, you can trust him.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.020]   If she says it, you can trust him."
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:28.220]   So this statement in and of itself is a beautiful statement that God does what he says he's
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.820]   going to do.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:35.500]   So without any context, that statement alone is a very honorable, respectable character
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   to have.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:43.140]   But when you put that in the context of Israel's history, when you put that in the context
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:49.980]   of our own history, that because God said he will do it, think about how many times
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.700]   in Israel's history that God would have had every right to revoke his promise.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.260]   I mean, we don't have to go that far.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.580]   Every single king in Israel's history, almost every single king, was evil and they led them
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.580]   astray.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.520]   They committed horrendous acts of idolatry.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.940]   Any part of Israel's history during the kings, he could have just stepped in and said, "That's
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   not true."
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.620]   The book of Judges, any one of those times, was that, "Oh, maybe through the desert they
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.620]   were faithful."
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.540]   Have you read the book of Numbers?
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:29.220]   If you look at Israel's history from the moment that they are conceived until the end of the
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:36.020]   Old Testament, every part of it is a list of every curse that they deserve.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.260]   So before they go in, God said, "If you live righteously, here's a blessing.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.460]   If you live unrighteously, here's a curse."
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.100]   And so if you look at the history from that point on, it's curse after curse after curse
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.280]   after curse.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.460]   So when you look at the statement, Numbers 23 verse 19, in the context of Israel's history,
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.820]   not even when they were in Egypt were they faithful.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.820]   Not even prior to Egypt were they faithful.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:05.060]   Even the patriarchs, if we study them carefully, they weren't necessarily great men.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:10.380]   And yet God says, "Because I made my promise, I will fulfill it."
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.340]   We don't even have to look at the Israelites.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.620]   Look at ourselves.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.620]   Look at ourselves.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.560]   Not only before we met Christ, after we met Christ.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.260]   When you look at your life carefully, how many events in your life can you examine and
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.260]   say, "You know what?
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.100]   I didn't deserve the grace of God.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.940]   God shouldn't have been patient with me."
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.780]   How many times in our lives could we stand before God saying, "You know what?
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.420]   I did good.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.420]   I am righteous.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.580]   I deserve the grace of God."
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.300]   If we're honest with ourselves, we're no different than the Israelites.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.500]   And the only reason why we celebrate this week is because God said He would be faithful
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.380]   despite us.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:58.180]   And so everything that takes place in this week is God's intentional plan to go to the
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.500]   cross for our sins.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.100]   See, this Palm Sunday is the first domino that falls.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.180]   You know, it's kind of like the cat's out of the bag, right?
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:15.180]   When we have DTR, the determining the relationship, those of you who are young and cool and hip,
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.660]   okay, DTR, when you have feelings for somebody and you contemplate, "Should I tell her?
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.020]   Should I not tell her?"
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.700]   And then so you say, "When's the right time?
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.700]   Should I?
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.700]   Am I going to get rejected?"
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.620]   And so you contemplate all of that and you weigh the pros and cons and, you know, you
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.940]   gear up and then, because you know once it comes out of your mouth, you can't take it
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.940]   back, right?
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.780]   So again, I've shared before about how I approached Esther.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.060]   And so I waited a year and a half of praying, "Is it the right time?
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.060]   Not right time?"
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.960]   Resisting, and then finally she's going to go to Boston to go to some dumb college.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.020]   And so I thought maybe this is the right time.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.620]   And thinking that maybe we're on the same page, maybe she's dropping hints.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.740]   And so, okay, okay, I'm taking her.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.420]   And then I asked her, "What are you thinking about me?"
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.420]   And she's like, "Like a brother."
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.980]   Right?
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.420]   It wasn't what I wanted to hear.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.080]   And so there was obviously misunderstanding.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:15.540]   But I remember when she said that, my heart just dropped because I prepared for so long.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.500]   And it's like, man, if I knew that this was the answer that was going to come, I probably
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.080]   wouldn't have gone through the trouble to say this.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.700]   But too late.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.020]   The cat's out of the bag.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.060]   So I used to have a discipler.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.980]   He used to always say, "If a guy takes out a sword, he should at least cut his toenails."
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.220]   You have to let it sink in.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:43.140]   In other words, if you're ready for battle, you should at least cut your toenails.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.140]   You should use the sword.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.500]   Anyway, if you don't understand what that means, I remember him saying that and saying,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.860]   "Well, the cat's out of the bag.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.180]   Might as well go forward."
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.060]   And so that's how we got started.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.860]   And I just told her, "Well, it's too late now.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.180]   So this is how I feel, and I want to marry you."
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.540]   What do you think about that?
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:08.000]   So I went forward, and that's how we got here, by the grace of God.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.480]   So this Palm Sunday is God deliberately knocking down the first domino.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:21.580]   And this is going to cause the crowds to be stirred, the leaders to pay attention, because
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.340]   they've been trying to get to Him for a long time.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.260]   But now Jesus is saying, "Here I am."
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.900]   And there's a reason why He goes to the temple as soon as He goes to Jerusalem, because He's
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.980]   challenging the leaders and publicly saying, "I'm here.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.980]   You've been looking for me.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.020]   I'm here."
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.420]   This is Palm Sunday.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.180]   Jesus deliberately and willfully walking into danger because He knows that this is going
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.940]   to lead Him to the cross.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:55.040]   He's riding on His donkey to fulfill that promise, that prophecy, to let people know
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.580]   that it's time.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:02.380]   Secondly, Jesus rode the donkey to establish His kingdom.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:07.180]   You know, people often think like Jesus is the humble servant, right?
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.780]   But in Zechariah 9, verse 9 and 10, it says, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.580]   Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.420]   Behold, your King is coming to you!"
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.900]   Your King is coming to you.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.700]   He is just and endowed with salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.700]   fall of a donkey.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.980]   "I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:33.180]   of war will be cut off, and He will speak peace to the nations, and His dominion will
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.580]   be from sea to sea and from the river to ends of the earth."
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:45.400]   See, during times of war, typically the King would be riding on His horse to exemplify
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.300]   power and authority.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.800]   But in times of peace, the King would be riding on a donkey.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.960]   So it wasn't unusual for a King to be on a donkey.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:02.500]   In fact, in 1 Kings 1.33-34, when David is anointing his son Solomon to be king, he puts
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.540]   him on a donkey and parades him.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.800]   In 1 Kings 1.33, it says, "The king said to them, 'David said to them, "Take with
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.020]   you the servants of your Lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.840]   him down to Gihon.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.440]   Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.880]   blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon.'"
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.400]   So it was a very common practice in Israel to have the kings riding on the donkey to
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.880]   be anointed.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.980]   So when Jesus came on a donkey, He wasn't simply refusing His kingdom.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.660]   He was actually declaring the King has arrived.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.300]   He was making it very clear that that's who He is.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.960]   You have to understand that the people were very eager to make Him king.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.480]   See, they weren't resisting Him as a king because they wanted Him to be king.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.600]   Remember, after He feeds the 5,000?
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.620]   They're so enamored with Him, they wanted to forcefully make Him king.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.440]   So Jesus had to break away from them.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.160]   So they didn't have a problem with making Him king because they thought if they made
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.320]   Him king, I mean, He's opening the eyes of blind people.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.000]   Women who are hemorrhaging for years get healed.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.560]   Lepers who couldn't join their families were walking back into their homes and able to
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   go to the temple.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.640]   Anybody who's hungry, He just breaks the bread and just give it to them, and they eat.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.900]   You get free Medicare.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.760]   You get free food, right?
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.880]   You get to go back into the temple.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   You're restored to your family.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.920]   I mean, if this guy's our king, we're set.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.880]   In fact, when Jesus came in and He was under the trial with Pontius Pilate, He said, "They
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.720]   are saying that you are the king of the Jews.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   Are you He?"
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.680]   And Jesus says, "It is as you say."
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.160]   Jesus was not forsaking His kingship.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:01.480]   Jesus is actually publicly declaring, "I am the king."
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:09.160]   But the problem is what they wanted from their king was to come and fight for them because
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:16.040]   they thought that if their king came, just like Moses delivered the Israelites from the
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.840]   Egyptians, that our Messiah and our king is going to come, and He's going to fight for
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.080]   us, and He's going to put us in this right place.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:28.960]   But Jesus says in John 18.36, "Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.560]   If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting so that I would
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:39.600]   not be handed over to the Jews, but as it is, my kingdom is not of this world.'"
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.800]   Think about how much energy is being poured right now to make this kingdom, this earthly
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.920]   kingdom a better place.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.200]   Because we think if we love Jesus, we need to unite and fight for these causes because
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.840]   we want this kingdom to be the place that we want to live.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.280]   See, that's exactly what the Jews were wanting and begging.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.400]   Because they thought that when Jesus came, whatever oppression that they felt, whatever
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.360]   disenfranchisement that they felt, because they were being treated as second, third,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.160]   fourth class citizens in the Roman kingdom.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.400]   So if Messiah comes, He's going to deliver us from that so that we can have the same
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.160]   benefits as the Roman citizens.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.880]   We can go where we need to go.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   We can have our children go to the schools that they want to go.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.040]   So we need the Messiah to make this right.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.680]   And that's why they were so excited.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.960]   In fact, the book of Matthew says the excitement was so great, there was a seismic stir, where
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.840]   we get the word seismology, an earthquake.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.000]   In fact, they said there, many historians think that there were probably close to 2
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.320]   million people in Jerusalem.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.480]   And the way that they calculate that is they have a record of how many lambs were killed
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.920]   during the Passover.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.200]   And so there's 10 people.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.660]   Usually you would need one lamb for every 10 person.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.520]   And so they calculated all of that, and they said it could have been as many as 2 million
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.920]   if they go by the number of the lambs.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.720]   The lowest number I've seen is somewhere around 250 to 500,000 people.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.600]   Whether you believe it's 250,000 or 2 million people, there was a tremendous number of people
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.980]   in Jerusalem.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:18.280]   And on top of that, Jesus just healed Lazarus, a very prominent person.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.380]   And so this rumor started to spread.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.380]   Is He the Messiah?
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.380]   Is He the Messiah?
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.700]   And they said, well, He healed Lazarus.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.020]   He actually even raised somebody from the dead.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:34.640]   So all these people came into town thinking, finally, our king is coming, and He's going
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.940]   to overthrow the Romans and put us in the right place.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.260]   See, Jesus came, and He wasn't resisting His kingship.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.540]   But the problem was His kingdom is not of this world.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.300]   They wanted to get going.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.800]   Remember Peter himself.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.980]   That's what was in his mind at Gethsemane.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.740]   When the guards of the temple came, remember Peter?
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.740]   That's what he was thinking, too.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   He took out his sword.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.740]   He was ready to fight.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   He's a fisherman.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.620]   He doesn't know how to wield a sword.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.740]   So he swings, and he misses, and he cuts the ear.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.620]   It's very comical.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:18.260]   And all it says is Jesus picked it up and put it back on.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.260]   Peter was ready to fight, because that's what all the Jews were thinking.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.380]   Now.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.380]   Is it now?
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.900]   You want me to take the sword out now?
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.340]   And Jesus said something weird that they didn't understand.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.340]   "He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.980]   Okay, so we're not going to use swords?
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   Maybe spears?
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.980]   Like, what?
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.720]   What are we ... We're about to fight.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   We have our general.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.240]   We have our king.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   They didn't understand.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.700]   And when Jesus said, "If this was my kingdom, I don't need you."
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.260]   You guys can't even get along.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.260]   I don't need you.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.100]   I will bring angels of my own and wipe them out.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.420]   I don't need a tiny sword that can't even hit the middle of the head and cut off people's
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   ears.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   I don't need soldiers like you.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:13.020]   He said, "But this is not my kingdom that I came to fight for."
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.380]   Colossians 1.13, "For he rescued us from the domain of darkness, transferred us to the
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.900]   kingdom of his beloved son."
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.980]   We're in the kingdom of his beloved son.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.700]   He's our king now.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:30.900]   See, this kingdom that we are a part of is already perfect because we have the perfect
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.100]   ruler.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:37.140]   This kingdom is already economically perfect because he's our ruler.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.580]   The only problem that we have is we keep reaching back to the old kingdom.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.700]   We keep wanting to live in both kingdoms.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.780]   But Jesus says, "I have come to establish my kingdom."
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.660]   Hebrews 4.16, it says, "Therefore, let us draw near with the confidence to the throne
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.860]   of grace so that we may receive mercy and find grace and help of need."
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.820]   Notice here he says, "To draw near to what?
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:06.740]   To the throne of grace, to the kingdom where our Lord reigns."
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:14.700]   We get into so much trouble because we think that the greatest need of our generation,
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.940]   greatest need for us, for our children, for our future, is to make the right decision,
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.540]   have the right leaders, have the right people, have the right family.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.660]   And if we do that, then we will be good.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:32.500]   You remember in 1 Samuel 8, verse 7, where the Israelites are demanding a king for themselves?
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.780]   And Samuel is offended by that because God was ruling through his prophets.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.740]   But he said, "No, all of our problem is because we don't have a king like they do.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.140]   If we had the king that they had, we wouldn't have this problem."
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.380]   So they demanded to have a king of their own.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.500]   And God says to Samuel in verse 7, the Lord said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of people
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.340]   in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.580]   rejected me from being king over them."
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.860]   This is why they miss Jesus.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.060]   Because the kingdom that they were thinking about, and they thought the solution was that
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:16.380]   somehow God helped us to get the king that we want.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.860]   Sometimes we think of lordship as, these are the things, this is what I think is going
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.060]   to make me happy.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.100]   And then we come to Jesus like, "Please help me.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.180]   Help me pay my bills.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180]   Help me to have peace.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.260]   Help me for my family.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.260]   Help me to do this."
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:34.020]   And Jesus becomes nothing more than a cosmic bellhop that comes and is just waiting to
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.300]   serve us.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.900]   He's a holy servant just waiting.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.900]   What do you want?
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.900]   Oh, what's going on?
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.900]   Oh, you're sad?
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.420]   Are you hungry?
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.860]   He came to establish his kingdom.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.540]   And that's what the riding of the donkey was.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.540]   I am the king.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:29:02.460]   See, if we're not careful, we embrace Jesus as our savior, but we reject him as our king.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:09.380]   Because a savior doesn't demand undivided loyalty, because he saves us.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.380]   He just comes to save us.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.260]   He just forgives us.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.580]   What a king does.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:20.940]   A savior does not judge your spending habits, but the king does.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:27.160]   A savior does not ask for obedience, but the king does.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:34.380]   If you do not know King Jesus, you may not know the Savior Jesus, because they are the
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.100]   same person.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.620]   You don't embrace the cross and then reject his kingdom.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:47.660]   You don't embrace Jesus as my servant, and he serves me, and he loves me, cares for me,
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.620]   and then you know nothing about the kingship of Christ.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:57.820]   See, the donkey represented his kingship to establish his throne.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:05.020]   Third and finally, Jesus rode the donkey to ultimately bring peace.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.740]   In Zechariah 9.10, it says, "I will cut off the chariots from Ephraim and the horse from
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:15.900]   Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be cut off, and he will speak peace to the nations."
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.940]   He's going to come as a king, humbled on a donkey, but the purpose of all of this, he
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.620]   says, is to bring peace.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:28.940]   In fact, remember when I read Genesis 49.10, this prophecy of the coming Messiah, he says,
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.340]   "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the rulers shall be between his feet,
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.820]   until Shiloh comes."
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:39.880]   The word Shiloh in Hebrew means tranquility, peace.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.080]   In Isaiah, Jesus is called the Prince of Peace.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:52.000]   The irony of all of this is that that's exactly what the Jews wanted.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   They wanted peace.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.740]   In fact, they wanted it so much that every time they greeted each other, they would say
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.740]   "Shalom."
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.300]   "Shalom to you," and then the person receiving that will say again, "Shalom to you."
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.660]   And so for generations after generations, they would say, "Peace, peace."
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.380]   But the word Shalom means more than simple peace.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.100]   It was understood that when God brings peace, when He gives you peace, that there's going
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.420]   to be wholeness.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.900]   Whatever is broken is going to be mended.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.860]   Whatever has gone wrong is going to be fixed.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.180]   It means to be complete, to be whole.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.100]   You know what's interesting?
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.700]   Is that the Muslim world, they greet each other in similar fashion.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:41.100]   If you have any Muslim friends, the way they greet you is "Maleka As-salam," right?
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.180]   Or "As-salam maleko," that's what it says.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.060]   "As-salam maleko" basically means, "Peace be unto you."
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:54.100]   And then the person receiving that will say, "Maleko as-salam," meaning, "Unto you,
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.980]   peace," in reverse.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.760]   So that's the way that the Muslim world greets each other.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.820]   So the Jews would greet each other, say, "Shalom," and the Muslims will greet each other by saying,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.700]   "Peace unto you."
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.500]   And the irony of all of this is that even though we, you and I, may not say, "Peace unto you,"
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.340]   when we say, "Happy New Year," or "Happy Birthday," right?
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.220]   "Blessings to you," we mean the same thing.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.740]   Like, we want to be whole.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.420]   We want whatever has gone wrong to be fixed.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.780]   If you are sick, to be healed.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:31.500]   If you're having financial problems, hopefully in the new year, God will bless you with money.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.660]   Whatever has gone wrong, God bless you.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.140]   And so that's what we mean, "Shalom," and that's what they mean when they say, "Shalom."
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.740]   And the irony of all of this is that as they were desperately waiting for the king, and
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:51.660]   as they were desperately waiting for peace, in Luke chapter 19, 41 to 42, as Jesus is
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:57.100]   riding on the donkey with the seismic stir of possibly up to two million people waving
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:04.660]   the palm branches, receiving their king, we find Jesus weeping in verse 41.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:09.920]   When he approached Jerusalem, he saw the city and wept over it, saying, "If you had known
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.220]   in this day, even you, the things which make for peace, but now they have been hidden from
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.300]   your eyes."
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   What they have desperately so wanted, they completely missed, and they ended up crucifying
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.760]   him.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.180]   So much of our lives is seeking peace.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.940]   If you came from a poor family, you think, "Man, if I could just make money, and I don't
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:43.300]   want to have the turmoil that my parents went through, so if I can just have a successful
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.580]   business, I will have peace.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:55.200]   If my children go to the right school, under the right politicians, I would have peace.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.580]   If I just had the right friends, right environment, and right neighborhood, and the right house,
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.260]   I will have peace."
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.260]   And so we strive from place to place, and there's so much talk right now about going
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.380]   to different states to find peace.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:17.620]   And if we're not careful, if we're not careful, we will fall under the same delusion as the
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:22.340]   Jews as they were waiting for the king and wanting so much to have peace, thinking that
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.500]   somehow if they changed, if they moved the puzzles around and bought the house in the
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.780]   right place and went to the right area, our children would have peace, I would have peace,
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.900]   I would be able to worship God in peace, I would raise our children in peace, retire
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.060]   in peace.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:48.460]   In the middle of seeking peace, they completely missed the prince of peace.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:58.900]   You remember in Genesis chapter 22, where Isaiah is called, or Abraham is called to
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:04.780]   sacrifice Isaiah, and we know this whole event is a fulfillment of that promise.
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:12.300]   As Abraham takes up the knife to strike him down, just as God told him to, God says, "Stop,"
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   and he says, "I will provide."
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.420]   And that's exactly what he's doing this week.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:25.220]   He's fulfilling that promise that he made, and he will take the place of Isaac to be
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.020]   that sacrifice.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.220]   In Genesis chapter 22 verse 3, it says this, "So Abraham rose early in the morning and
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:40.300]   saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and Isaac, his son."
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.140]   Isaac rode that donkey to go to the cross.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:53.460]   So him being on that donkey not only represented his public and specific fulfillment of his
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:59.900]   will, it wasn't just simply to him to declare his kingship, it was to bring peace that only
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:00.900]   he could bring.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.820]   In Ephesians 2, 17, it says, "And he came and preached peace to you who were far away
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.340]   and peace to those who were near."
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.780]   Again in Ephesians 6, 15, talking about the gospel, "Your feet will be preparation for
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.340]   the gospel of peace."
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:24.540]   In the last year or two years, we've been hearing that phrase, "No justice, no peace."
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.060]   No justice, no peace.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.260]   And we are hearing it, we're reading it, declaring it.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.760]   People are united for this purpose.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:41.860]   But be careful, because that's exactly what the Jews were doing.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:48.660]   Because they thought that if their king came, that he was going to fix the government.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.800]   He was going to fix the economy.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.980]   He was going to fix their family.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.580]   He was going to fix their future.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.080]   He was going to fix their standing.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.820]   He was going to fix their temple.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.780]   Yet in the midst of all of that, they completely missed him.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.420]   Jesus says in John 14, 27, "Peace I leave with you.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.240]   My peace I give to you.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.260]   Not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.500]   Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful."
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:22.580]   You cannot have the peace of God without the peace with God.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.900]   So this week is to get us to be recalibrated.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.260]   Recalibrate our hearts, because our natural tendency, my bet is, there's not a single
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.580]   person in here who doesn't have some sort of turmoil in your heart.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.740]   There's not a single person in here that doesn't have something to grieve over.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.420]   There's not a single person in here that doesn't have something to pray desperately over, whether
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.140]   we are actually doing that or not.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.380]   But where do you find this peace?
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.060]   Do you believe that Jesus is our peace?
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.300]   Do you believe that Jesus is the Prince of Peace?
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:05.460]   So we pray that this week, as we go over the details of what happened every day, that we
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.940]   don't look to man for answers.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.420]   We don't look to government for answers.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.100]   We don't look to organizations for answers.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.380]   We don't hold hands and say, "You know, we're going to finally get the justice that we deserve."
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:24.180]   Because the only person who can actually declare desire or demand justice is Jesus Christ.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.940]   A sinner who demands justice is demanding punishment.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.980]   It is not justice that you and I desire.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.420]   It is mercy.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.740]   And that's exactly what Jesus came to do, to give us mercy.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.660]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:47.940]   And I want to read a portion of this hymn that you guys all know very well.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.940]   It is "Well With My Soul."
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:56.540]   You know the story behind Horatio Spafford, who was a famous and very successful attorney
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.180]   who made a lot of money, and he turned that money into more money by purchasing all this
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.180]   property.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.180]   So he became a very wealthy man.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.500]   But there was a huge fire that broke out in Chicago, and he lost everything overnight.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.980]   Feeling distraught, he sent his family, his four girls and his wife, over to England so
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.700]   that possibly he could start over over there.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:23.060]   But on this journey, the ship has a shipwreck, and all four of his girls died, and only his
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.100]   wife survived.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:29.340]   She ends up going to England and sends him a wire saying, "All is lost.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.020]   All four of our children are gone."
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:37.700]   In his bereavement, he gets on the boat to go join his wife to comfort her.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:43.260]   And on his journey, riding the boat, they were crossing exactly the same place where
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.940]   his daughters died.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   And on the intercom, the captain of the boat said, "This is where that other boat sank."
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.780]   And as he was looking upon the waters, he wrote this hymn.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.620]   And in this hymn, he says, "When peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:08.340]   sea billows roll, whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say, it is well with my soul.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.900]   It is well with my soul.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:17.480]   Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, let this best assurance control
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:23.360]   that Christ has regarded my helpless estate and has shed his own blood for my soul.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.140]   It is well with my soul.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.960]   It is well.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:33.820]   My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin not in part but the whole, is nailed
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.140]   to the cross and I bear it no more.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.140]   Praise the Lord.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.140]   Praise the Lord.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.140]   O my soul, it is well.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.140]   It is well with my soul.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.140]   It is well."
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:47.340]   How can a human being write this?
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:54.380]   In the situation that he was in, watching over the very waters where his four beloved
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:01.000]   daughters drowned, to say, "It is well with my soul.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.540]   It is well with my soul."
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:11.580]   Only a man who has found peace in Christ can write these words.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.580]   These aren't words that a natural man can write in the situation that he is in.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.580]   It is well with my soul.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.220]   It is well.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.620]   What makes you well?
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.540]   What do you think is going to make you well?
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.660]   What are you pursuing because you want peace?
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:36.380]   I pray that each one of us would take this week deliberately to walk through the steps
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.180]   as he goes to the cross and recognize that this is why he came.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:49.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
