[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   Let me pray and then we'll jump into the message today.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.040]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued faithfulness over our lives.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.740]   As we have our last service in 2017, I pray that you would help us to remember your grace
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.480]   and your goodness and to refocus our attention, Lord God, in preparation for the coming year.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.900]   We pray, Father God, that you would open our eyes, soften our hearts.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.180]   May your word have more impact than just our ears, that our lives, Lord God, may be changed,
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.400]   that you would examine us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us, that our faith and
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.080]   our worship may truly be in spirit and in truth.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.620]   Again, can you believe it's 2017?
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.320]   It's the last Sunday of 2017.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.400]   And again, I really feel like I just said this yesterday, and I'm sure some of you guys
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.040]   who've been here for a while, it's like a broken record.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.920]   It just goes by that fast, that quickly.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.600]   And you get to a certain point in age where you don't realize time going on until you
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.460]   see your kids growing up.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.000]   And then last week, again, seeing all the young children up here that didn't exist a
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.120]   few years ago actually come in and singing and that ministry and group growing, you kind
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.620]   of see the time going by as you see the children getting older.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.040]   It is really going by quick.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.840]   And I was reflecting upon 2017, and there's a lot of crazy things that are going on in
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   the world right now.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.280]   You know, obviously we have the, you know, North Korea who tested the nuclear bomb this
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.380]   year.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.300]   And I know we watch this in the news, and there is an alarm as far as the news is concerned,
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.940]   but it's not real to us because we're so far removed.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.160]   Sometimes we watch these things that are happening, and it just doesn't seem real because it's
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   far off.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.780]   It's another continent.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.640]   It's just something that the leaders have to deal with.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.360]   But the possibility of nuclear war, at least that I can remember, has never been this serious.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.480]   And so, again, it just doesn't seem real to us, but these are serious issues that are
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.320]   taking place right now.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.160]   The persecution around the world, at least in the time that I've been a Christian, I've
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.360]   never seen it to this extent, where there are millions of people literally risking their
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.520]   lives just to get together and have worship that we're having here.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   This is just assumed.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.640]   You know, you come to church on Sunday, and my biggest concern is make sure the air conditioner
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880]   is working properly, and I've got to get here a little bit earlier just in case there's
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.520]   traffic, so I don't want to miss Sunday.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.240]   But there are millions of people around the world.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.840]   They have to think twice when they take their children to church that are they going to
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   be safe today.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.240]   And this is happening right now.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.560]   And again, there's always been persecution, but the degree of persecution that we're seeing
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.760]   around the world, I've never seen it, at least not in my lifetime.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.840]   But along with that, there's a lot of exciting things as well.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   I mean, with the persecution, there's never been a time that I remember where evangelism
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.920]   has become so prominent.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.940]   And we hear stories of very difficult areas in the world where people are literally risking
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.520]   their lives, and they're experiencing revival in the midst of persecution and risking their
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.840]   lives and many people being martyred.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.000]   But many, many other people are also coming to faith as a result of this persecution.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.080]   And so it kind of reminds me a lot of the early church.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.640]   When you study the first two, three hundred years of the early church where intense persecution
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.480]   led to a massive spreading of the gospel, and it is taking place right now.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.300]   In fact, this morning, I got a very encouraging email from our pastors in India, and just,
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.340]   you know, they're preparing for our team coming.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.880]   There's about 15 of us that will be leaving next Friday, not this Friday, but next Friday.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.420]   And he sent me an email saying how excited they are.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.820]   And you know, one of the concerns that we've had that I shared with you was that the pastors
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.100]   are getting persecuted, and there was an incident where the local leader actually dragged out
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.580]   a Christian from his home because they refused to participate in the idol worship that the
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.620]   leader of that village asked everybody to participate in.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.620]   And so the pastors had to go and talk with them and calm them down, and I don't know
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.780]   exactly at the end how it ended, but again, the persecution in India is at a level, again,
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.040]   that I haven't seen.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.220]   But he also said that along with the ministry that we've been doing, to going out and doing
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.980]   eye care and wound care and VBS and various things that we've had, he said a lot of the
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.700]   previous village leaders that had us come are actually asking us to come back.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   And they're Hindus, and they're asking us to come back because they said, again, I'll
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.800]   share this with, again, the team who are going out to India, because I just got it this morning,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.820]   and we're saying that because of the sacrifices and the generosity of the people who went,
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.140]   and many of you who've donated and helped us out with that, that the Hindus have a very
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.340]   good view of Christians, that you guys are kind enough to do all this, even to us, and
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.940]   we would have never thought of you, but you guys are coming and doing this for us.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.020]   So the Hindu leaders are actually asking us to come, to do that again in their village
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.820]   and how excited they are to have us come back.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.380]   So even in the midst of heavy persecution, the work of Christ is, again, I haven't seen
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.380]   it like this.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:30.620]   I've been a Christian for about 33, 34 years, and to this level, the hatred in the politics,
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.420]   the Republicans and Democrats never, ever got along, at least that I can remember, but
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.780]   to this extent, where you have half the country thinks the other half of the country is an
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.700]   idiot, and vice versa, and the kind of rhetoric and the kind of attack that both sides have
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.900]   on each other, and I'm just kind of curious how this is going to, what kind of fruit this
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.780]   is going to bear in the next election, or maybe when the Democrats come into power,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.780]   and maybe there's going to be a retaliation.
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.420]   I don't know what's going to happen, but I've never seen it to this degree.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.780]   So the world that you and I live in, and even in just a short period in 2017, the things
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.000]   that are taking place, even though it may not seem real, if you take a step back and
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.320]   soberly examine what's going on, we have to admit that there's something extraordinary
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.260]   being stirred up in our generation.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.300]   Now, is this going to lead to the coming of Christ?
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.980]   We don't know, but we are told that as Christians that we are not to be caught off guard like
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.820]   the rest of the world, where the thief comes in and breaks in and be surprised by a second
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.820]   coming.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.260]   He told us to watch and to be sober.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.100]   Watch for the signs of the times, and the signs that he told us to watch for are very
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.180]   similar to the things that are going on now.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.380]   So again, we don't know if the previous generation, maybe they had certain things that happened
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:56.020]   and caused them to think this way, but whatever the case, we have to admit that some of the
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.380]   things that are taking place around us, any one of those things could explode that can
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.260]   affect the world.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.940]   We have to be careful that we don't respond to the current atmosphere, whether it's political,
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.700]   economical, or whatever it may be, like the rest of the world.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.540]   Getting together like, "Oh my gosh, the world is going to end.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.060]   What if the nuclear bomb goes off?
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.740]   What if these terrorists, they get into our country?"
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.500]   All of these concerns, and looking for some politician, looking for the UN, looking for
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.760]   something to come along to fix all of this.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.380]   We have to be careful as Christians that we don't respond to what's happening in the world
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:44.800]   like the rest of the world, because our hope is firmly rooted in Christ.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.180]   Maybe there's things that are happening in your life.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.980]   All of these things are political, and we're just kind of removed from them.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.900]   We're just watching it from a distance.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.180]   There's probably a lot of personal things that maybe we know of or don't know of that
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.500]   caused your world to get rocked, whether it's a job or a relationship, whether it's an economic
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.460]   struggle, whatever it may be.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.460]   There may be something a lot closer to you that you've been wrestling with anxiously.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.780]   But one thing that I've realized as time goes by, the most precious thing that we have is
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.780]   time.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:24.020]   At some point, you think it's money, because money, you can buy this and you can buy that.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   But money comes and goes.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.540]   There are periods when you have enough.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.180]   There's a period when you have abundance.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.340]   And there are periods when you don't.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.380]   And you can have that later.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.780]   You can have it now.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.220]   But time, once it is spent, is gone.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.780]   2017, no matter what you did or didn't do, all your regrets, you're never going to get
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.820]   2017 back.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.060]   That's it.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.260]   You have your teens, that's your period.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.580]   If you're single, that period of singleness is going to be gone.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.460]   You get married, that period, that period that God gives is that.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.940]   And you don't get a second chance on that.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:04.060]   So the older I get, I realize just how precious time is.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.300]   So the question that we have to ask ourselves at the end of every year as we reevaluate,
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.300]   how was my time spent?
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.060]   Did I spend my time or was it invested?
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.820]   Did I invest it on things that I value?
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.420]   These are important things and that was my target and that's what I ran for.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.660]   Or did I just spend my time?
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.420]   The difference between the two is the difference between pursuing Christ and just drifting
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.820]   along in the world.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.800]   Just coming to church and obviously hearing sermons, being part of a Bible study, does
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.540]   not automatically mean that you have invested your time.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:51.820]   To passionately pursue Christ, would you say that that characterized 2017?
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.580]   Or you just kind of went with the flow?
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.300]   It just happens that your flow happens to be a part of a Christian community.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:04.620]   But was there a deliberate pursuit of the things of Christ?
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.540]   Oftentimes we think about revival.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.860]   And again, I don't know how many of you have at least spent some time praying for your
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.660]   spiritual life.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.380]   And I'm sure many of you who have children pray often for your children, for their spiritual
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.380]   lives.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.780]   But how passionately did you pray for your personal spiritual life, where you are in
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.340]   your walk with God?
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.700]   How did you pursue Him?
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.020]   This idea of revival, oftentimes we think of us drawing near to God or God drawing near
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.980]   to us and how that is going to be so wonderful.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.020]   But the idea of revival is asking God to be near.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.980]   And God, when He draws near, He examines every part of our lives.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.500]   He examines our finances.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.980]   He examines what you're watching.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.500]   He examines the way you spend your time.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.260]   He examines what you allow in your heart, in your thought.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.820]   Revival happens when God appears in our lives and His light of righteousness exposes all
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.420]   of our sin, not to simply bring us shame, but to repentance.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.540]   So that through repentance that we may have this deep fellowship with God.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.500]   Revival is not some superficial thing where God comes and He touches your heart and everything
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.740]   just feels good because God is around.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.860]   Revival happens when He draws near to us, this holy, holy, holy God.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:31.900]   Have we been pursuing Christ or have we been just been wishing?
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:37.900]   What was our 2017 like when you examine, was it spent or was it invested?
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.280]   Apostle Paul says in Philippians 3, 8 through 16, "Indeed, I count everything as lost because
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.380]   of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ, Jesus my Lord."
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.740]   He says everything, everything, and he's literally talking about everything.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.340]   "In light of Christ, for His sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.100]   Him as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ."
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.340]   He lost everything.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.980]   See, Apostle Paul didn't meet Christ on the road to Damascus and opened his eyes and said,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:16.300]   "Wow, I was completely wrong that salvation doesn't come from obeying the law."
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.260]   He didn't go from that and realize that I was completely wrong about Christ and say,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.820]   "Wow, I was completely wrong about that," and then went home, got married, had kids,
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.660]   and lived happily ever after.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:32.940]   His encounter with Christ absolutely changed his perspective of what was and was not worth
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.020]   pursuing.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.100]   So his theology about God and righteousness and salvation, once that got changed, his
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.100]   life changed.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.380]   What he pursued changed.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.540]   That's why he says, "Even though I lost everything in light of what he gained in Christ, all
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.420]   of that seemed rubbish."
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.820]   "And be found," verse 9, it says, "in Him, not having a righteousness of my own that
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.900]   comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.540]   that depends on faith, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and may
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:13.780]   share His suffering, becoming like Him in His death, that by any means possible I may
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.100]   attain the resurrection from the life."
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.460]   He found what Jesus was saying about the kingdom of God.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.100]   It's like a treasure that a farmer found, and he sold everything to gain it.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:31.420]   In light of Christ, all of it was considered rubbish.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:39.660]   How much of our Christian frustration is wanting Christ and the world?
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.380]   How much of our pursuit of Christ is frustrated because we're pursuing Christ and the world
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.380]   at the same time?
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.980]   Where we know, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know that that
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.980]   is not possible.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.100]   Jesus said, "The world and Christ, it is in conflict.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.860]   The world is under condemnation of God."
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.020]   He says, "If you love the world, the love of the Father is not in you."
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.460]   This is not deep Christian theology.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.740]   This is not Theology 401.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.380]   The first thing that you learn about being a follower of Christ is that the world and
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.260]   his passion, it died for me.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.500]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.660]   It is no longer I who live.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:23.380]   And yet, if we're not careful, we live all our lives trying to prove the Bible wrong.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.820]   Why can't we have it all?
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.420]   Paul says in verse 12, "Not that I have already obtained this, or am already perfect, but
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.420]   I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus made me his own."
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.780]   Paul realized that the moment that he met Christ, that he died.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.100]   I don't belong to myself anymore.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.940]   He didn't just open my eyes so that I can have different thoughts about Christ.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.340]   He said, "He purchased me.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.660]   I belong to him.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.340]   And so now I try to live my life and press on to possess what he's already possessed
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.340]   for me."
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.500]   Brothers, verse 13, "I do not consider that I have made it my own, but one thing I do,
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:05.420]   forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead."
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.780]   You think maybe Apostle Paul might have thought that as he was being beaten and stoned, and
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:17.060]   as his countrymen were questioning his motives, as he was evangelizing and he would leave,
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.660]   and then the false prophets would come in, is the only reason why he's saying that to
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.100]   you is because he's trying to make money off of you?
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.780]   Do you think in the midst of all of that, that possibly there are times when Paul may
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.140]   have looked back into his old life and thought, "Man, it was easy before I met Christ."
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.780]   That he was well-known, he could have been a member of the Sanhedrin if he wasn't already,
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.380]   and how privileged he was as a man, as a Jewish man.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:48.160]   Do you think possibly that Apostle Paul may be here saying, "Forgetting what is behind,"
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.860]   because possibly this is a thing that maybe he wrestled with?
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.380]   But he says he presses on, "forgetting what lies behind and straining toward what lies
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.340]   ahead."
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.540]   How much of our Christian life is frustrated because we have this tendency that we have
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.620]   one eye on Christ and the other eye on the things that we are called to leave behind.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.380]   And we want to try to take as much as possible.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.680]   And we all know that death is coming.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   We all know that.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   That's a fact.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.940]   You don't have to be a Christian to know this.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   We all know this.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:30.940]   But so much of our investment in light of eternity is for 20, 30 years.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.520]   So much of our dedication, so much of our frustration, so much of our prayers, so much
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:46.060]   of our passion is dedicated to have a good 20, 30 years in light of eternity.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.940]   And yet, Paul says, "I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.100]   in Christ Jesus."
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.940]   Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if anything you think otherwise,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.420]   God will reveal that also to you.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.100]   Only let us hold true to what we have attained.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.660]   Hold true.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.100]   Hold true to what we confess.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.600]   Hold true to the doctrinal statements that you say you believe.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.860]   Hold true to the things that bother you when other people preach it wrong.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:22.540]   Hold true to the church that you chose to belong to because you believe in the doctrines
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.780]   that are being taught and that we profess.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.340]   To not just simply be a part of the church, but to hold true to these things.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:35.300]   Not just in your thinking, not just in acknowledgment, but in our pursuit.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:41.380]   Are we pursuing these things, or are we hoping that just through osmosis, by being around
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.420]   these things, that you would also be benefactors?
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.700]   When you look at Apostle Paul's testimony, what he says, do you observe this as if you're
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.620]   in a museum, like you're observing painting?
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.820]   You acknowledge that, and it's beautiful.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.600]   You hear other people's testimonies about their passion and sacrifice for God.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.340]   Do you look at that and say, "Well, I'm very challenged by that, and I appreciate
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.300]   that, and we want to even glorify that, but we appreciate it like we're watching a painting.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.900]   It has nothing personally to do with me, other than it affects my affection."
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.820]   Or do you see this testimony as a calling from God for all of us to pick up our cross
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.780]   and deny ourselves and follow him?
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.140]   Do you see the Apostle Paul's challenge for all those who are mature to think this
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:33.140]   way, to pursue passionately what he has laid before us?
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:39.420]   When you think of 2017, was it spent, or was it invested?
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.300]   There's a reason why in Hebrews it says to fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.500]   To fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.300]   Not only to gaze upon him, not only to observe him from a distance, but to fix our eyes upon
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   Christ.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.780]   And the reason why we are challenged to fix our eyes upon Christ is because our natural
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.340]   tendency is to drift.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.020]   Nobody drifts to passionate pursuit of Christ.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.180]   Nobody drifts toward the kingdom.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.660]   We drift away from Christ.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.980]   We drift toward the world.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:16.820]   And so, unless we are committed to fix our eyes upon Christ, our natural tendency is
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.080]   to forget.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.300]   And so the challenge for us is not just to be good listeners, not just to be good students,
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:34.820]   but participants or members of the church, but are we pursuing Christ?
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.720]   Are we passionately pursuing Christ?
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.460]   Is Christ our primary affection?
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.860]   For the next couple of weeks, this week and then the next time I'm up here, I want to
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.620]   focus our attention upon what Christ says about himself.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.700]   You know, Jesus asked his disciples, "Who do you say I am?" and they gave various answers,
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.160]   but the question, you know, ultimately he wanted their own personal confession.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:07.360]   But the "I am" statements of John's gospel is Jesus himself basically correcting the
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.700]   false and superficial understanding of Christ.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.860]   Majority of his "I am" statements are not given to the hostile people.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.180]   He's given to people who are coming to him thinking, "I want to follow you, Jesus.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.180]   You are going to be my Messiah.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.740]   I want to establish you as king."
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.660]   And he cuts through all of that.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:29.420]   And again, excuse my language, he's cutting through the bull.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.500]   He's cutting through the bull of all these people who are superficially acknowledging
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:40.880]   Christ and he sees through that and he sees ineffective, defective faith.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.120]   And he's countering that saying, "Now you think I am this, but this is who I really
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.780]   am."
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.220]   And so what I want to do is to take two weeks, the first week, today we're going to be dealing
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.580]   with the first four "I am" statements and then the next time I'm up here we're going
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.060]   to be dealing with the last three "I am" statements.
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.860]   And it is so crucial to our faith, especially where we live.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.620]   The Christianity that you and I experience, that we pay very close attention to what Jesus
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:12.340]   is saying because, again, he's cutting through the bull of superficial faith and acknowledgement.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.340]   I want to look first of all for the first one he says, the first of the seven that he
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.940]   gives in the Gospel of John, chapter 6, verse 35, and that's the statement where he says,
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.700]   "I am the bread of life."
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.980]   Now in order to understand these contexts, we need to understand to whom he's speaking
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.020]   and why he's saying this and what is his main goal.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.880]   That we don't add meaning to this.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.580]   The first of the "I am" statements really is cutting through where on the surface it
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:50.460]   looks like his ministry has gained ground and he's popular than, more popular than any
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.380]   other leader that they've seen up to this point.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.220]   5,000 people in the beginning of chapter 6 are gathered together and this is just number
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.220]   of men.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.340]   This is not counting women and children.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.260]   So the commentators believe that, again, the common number that they give is somewhere
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.380]   around 20,000 people.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:12.140]   Now even today, even in a large city, a thousand people gathered together is a pretty decent
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.220]   sized number.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.540]   But if you go to some sports arena and they have 20,000, 30,000 people, that's considered
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.540]   humongous.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.860]   I don't know if you've ever been to a Lakers game.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.900]   That's about the number of people that they gather together.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.260]   That's a lot of people.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.140]   And that's in the context of a city surrounded by millions of people.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.980]   This is 20,000 people gathered in the countryside.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.660]   Gathered in the countryside, 20,000 people.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:42.060]   So you can imagine the frenzy and excitement over Jesus that caused this many people to
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.480]   gather together.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.320]   They were so enamored with Christ, they don't even think about food.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.980]   But this miracle that Jesus performs here at the feeding of the 5,000, at least the
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.940]   number-wise that's given to us in the scripture, the feeding of the 5,000 is unlike any other
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.020]   miracle.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.860]   In comparison, Jesus performed many other miracles that would blow this miracle out
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860]   of the water.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.220]   All he did was multiply fish and bread.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.780]   But the difference between this miracle and the other miracle was this was done where
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.380]   every single person in attendance ate this miraculous bread, ate this miraculous fish.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.980]   They weren't just observers.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.860]   It wasn't just a friend of theirs.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.140]   It wasn't just somebody that they heard of, they opened their eyes, like could that have
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.640]   really been?
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.820]   Every single person in attendance, very publicly, and even after the miracle took place, there
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.740]   was 12 baskets left over.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.740]   Why?
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.740]   Why 12 baskets left over?
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.740]   Because it's so inefficient.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.620]   They didn't have refrigerators back then.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.460]   They were going to go and sell it and make money.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:47.500]   All of that for the purpose of publicly declaring who he is so that every single person in attendance
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.100]   will walk away from that saying, "I experienced this miracle."
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.060]   They didn't hear about it.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.620]   They didn't read about it.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.660]   Then somebody didn't give their testimony about it.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.020]   Every single person did.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:05.380]   As a result of this miracle, they were so excited, it says in chapter 6, verse 14, when
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:11.020]   the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, "This is indeed the prophet who
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.020]   is to come into the world."
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.260]   As a result of that, they wanted to forcefully make him king.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.140]   Understandably.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.620]   This is the Messiah that they've been waiting for.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.340]   Not only does he have authority, he's not afraid of the religious leaders.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.820]   He's not afraid of the Roman government.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:34.260]   I mean, and he cares for them, to even feed them, afraid that they're going to go hungry.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   He walks on water.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.440]   He has power over nature.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.380]   Why wouldn't you want him to be king?
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.380]   So they wanted to.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.460]   Whether Jesus wanted to or not, he's going to be our king.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:49.060]   So on the surface, it seems like Jesus has reached the peak of his ministry.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:54.620]   20,000 people in the countryside are going wherever he goes.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.900]   And yet, Jesus, knowing what their intent was, he goes to the other side of the sea.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.580]   When they find that they're gone, they pack up their bags with their children and they
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.900]   go look for him.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.060]   And they finally find him in verse 25, chapter 6.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.420]   And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.420]   did you come here?"
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.180]   Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me not because you
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.180]   saw a sign, but because you ate your fill of the loaves."
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:27.060]   In other words, Jesus is seeing right through the bull.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.620]   On the surface, it seems like these are believers.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.780]   On the surface, it seems like they love Jesus and they're all disciples of Christ.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.780]   Where did you go?
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.700]   And Jesus said, "You're not coming to me because you saw signs.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.360]   You're coming to me because you ate and you want more bread.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.700]   Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life,
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:53.100]   which the Son of Man will give to you, for on him God the Father has set his seal."
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.820]   So initially when Jesus corrects them and he confronts their superficial faith, their
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:04.360]   response is then they said to him, "Then what must we do to be doing the works of God?"
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.700]   So up to this point, they're going along with Jesus.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.420]   Okay, I mean, you're calling us out that we don't fully understand, but exactly what is
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.780]   it that you want us to do?
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.980]   And look what Jesus' response is.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:20.940]   Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.300]   And he repeats this to believe, believe, believe four or five separate times.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.460]   The primary work that he calls us to do is to believe.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.480]   He doesn't say go to church and read your Bible.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.980]   He doesn't say join membership.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.460]   He says first and foremost to believe.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.900]   Now the reason why he tells them to believe is because they didn't believe.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.660]   Even though in all, everything presented to us superficially looks like they were believers
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:55.720]   following Jesus, he's telling them to believe because they weren't true believers.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.900]   And as a result of that, verse 31, "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.740]   He gave them bread to eat."
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.980]   And then he says in verse 30, "What sign do you have?"
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.420]   You notice that in verse 14, he says, "When the people saw the sign that he had done,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.820]   they believed that he was a prophet and wanted to make him a king."
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:20.660]   And then in verse 30, he says to believe and he said, "Well, show us a sign."
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.020]   There is something going on between verse 14 and 30.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.100]   There's something missing in what Jesus is pointing out in verse 30 versus what they
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.780]   said in verse 14.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.860]   And I think you and I can read right into it.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:41.820]   They were following Jesus because the bread was free, because they get free health care,
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.820]   because Jesus cares.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.100]   Who wouldn't want this as a king?
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:50.260]   If he ran for president, who wouldn't pick this man as your president?
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.020]   I can't understand who wouldn't pick him.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.140]   He's sacrificial, he's giving, he's loving, he cares.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.540]   He has power.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.540]   He's faithful.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.700]   I mean, he loves children.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.500]   Who wouldn't pick him as the president?
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:11.060]   And yet, this is not why Jesus came.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.660]   What you are looking for me is not why I came.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.540]   It is in that context Jesus is telling them, "I didn't come to give you bread.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.580]   I didn't come to you so that you can lengthen your life.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:30.620]   I didn't come so that you can have a better life," said, "I came to save us from our sins.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.420]   I am the bread of life."
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.220]   In fact, even the very bread that they're asking for, the manna.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   Look what it says in Deuteronomy 8, 3-4.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.660]   He says, "And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.700]   not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:57.160]   by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord."
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:03.580]   He said even the reason why he allowed you to go hungry is so that when you do get fed,
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.880]   that you realize that it wasn't the manna that you needed.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.160]   That it wasn't the manna that he was actually giving.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.920]   That through the manna, even in the manner in which he gave the manna, it's all of it
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.880]   to teach them that he is the bread of life.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:27.640]   How often do we commit to Christ when we are eating and when we're well fed?
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.440]   But as soon as you throw a wrench into our lives, where is God?
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.600]   What is he doing?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:40.400]   How much of our faithfulness to God is contingent upon our circumstance?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   Looking for bread.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.160]   See, he's looking right through the bull.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.040]   The reason why this is so important is the distinction between what he says in verse
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:56.960]   14 and the correction that he's making in verse 30 is not a difference between a better
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.520]   house in heaven.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   It's a distinction between their defective faith and what Jesus is pointing out is a
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.880]   distinction between damnation and salvation.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.480]   That's a distinction between a child of God and a child of the devil of superficially
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:23.160]   going after Christ because we think he's going to give us something, not recognizing that
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.640]   Christ came to bring himself.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.280]   That's what he means to them that he is the bread of life.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:35.560]   That's the reason why in verse 66 he says, "After this, many of his disciples turned
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.960]   back and no longer walked with him."
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.360]   So the feeding of the 5,000 was a record of the peak of his ministry, but at the end of
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.120]   the chapter is the utter failure of his ministry superficially.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.120]   They all left him.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.680]   As soon as they found out what he was saying, they left him.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.840]   And in the very next verse, Jesus turns to his disciples and asks, "Are you going to
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.120]   leave too?"
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.860]   They said, "Where are we going to go?
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.360]   I don't fully understand what you're saying, but you have the words of truth.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.600]   We believe you."
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.960]   And because of this belief, they endure with him.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.660]   He is the bread of life.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.440]   The whole reason why you and I are gathered here together is not to instruct you how to
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.680]   become a better father or a better mother.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.640]   It's not to instruct you so that you can have better communication with your husband and
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.560]   wife and all of these things are helpful things.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.440]   It's not how to be a moral person so we can be good at doing this and that.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.160]   That's not why we're here.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.520]   You can gain that from world wisdom.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.960]   There's a lot of worldly wisdom that you can gain from.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.120]   I mean, I don't, you know, I'm not a fan of Oprah, but Oprah says a lot of good stuff.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.960]   Has nothing to do with Christ, but there's a lot of worldly wisdom.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.920]   There's no way I can give you the worldly wisdom to make all of your life better.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.800]   The only reason why you and I are gathered here together is because the one who is the
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:05.000]   bread of life can only be found in his word.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.880]   Our goal is not to make sure you have a better community or you're loved or you feel accepted.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.480]   All of these things are byproducts and all of these things are benefits, but that is
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.240]   not why we're here.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.840]   Is Christ your bread?
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.720]   Is he your bread?
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.040]   Or are you looking through him to find bread?
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.560]   Secondly, he says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.960]   Again, we need to understand this in the context in which he says it.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:37.600]   When he says he is the light of the world, it is at the end of the Feast of the Tabernacle,
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.440]   or oftentimes called the Feast of the Booth.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:46.080]   And it was a celebration that they did every single year to celebrate God's deliverance
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.000]   of Israel from Egypt.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.920]   And in particular, the tail end of the celebration was where while they were wandering through
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:01.520]   the desert for 40 years, how God led them in Exodus chapter 13, it says, "God led them
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.160]   during the day with a pillar of cloud.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.400]   And at night when they couldn't see, God would come in the pillar of fire and then he would
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400]   lead them."
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.000]   So whenever the pillar of cloud would move, they would move.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.280]   Whenever the pillar of fire would move, they would also move.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.040]   And they would settle, they would settle.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.440]   So what they did to commemorate this in the Feast of Booth is that they set up a candelabra
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.560]   that's 75 feet tall.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.920]   And they would have that lit.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.280]   And the purpose of that light was every time that they would see this light, it was one
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.440]   to commemorate God's deliverance of Israel and how he led them through the period of
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.720]   the desert.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.560]   But secondly, it also pointed to the hope that they have in the Messiah.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.120]   Their Messiah was going to come and deliver them from this bondage that they're in.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.800]   You have to understand that for 400 years, God did not send the prophet.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.180]   They were in utter spiritual darkness.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.200]   They were oppressed by the Romans, the pagans, and they didn't have their own country.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.120]   They had a puppet king who wasn't even a Jew.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.600]   And so they were constantly coming to the temple, and when they saw the light, they
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.660]   were reminded that the Messiah is coming, and he's going to lead us like God led us
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.660]   in the desert.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:18.040]   It is in that context, Jesus says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.600]   That Messiah that you are hoping would come, I am that Messiah.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.360]   I am the light.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:27.120]   And again, in John 8, 12, it says, "Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.200]   will have the light of life."
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.960]   Whatever it is that you're hoping for to come into your life that you think will fix
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.920]   it, Jesus says, "I am the light.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.640]   I am the light that will lead and guide you."
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.780]   In fact, in Psalm 36, verse 9, the psalmist says of God, "For with you is the foundation
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.780]   of life.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.560]   In your light do we see light."
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.320]   In your light do we see light.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:00.720]   In other words, until we recognize God as our light, everything else becomes dark.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   Let me give you an illustration.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.360]   This poinsettia here, what color is this?
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   Okay.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.360]   It's red.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.080]   I know some of you guys are going to say, "It's not really red."
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.440]   Okay, let's just say it's red, okay?
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.640]   It's red, right?
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.920]   But the reason why it's red is because we have all the lights on.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.680]   If we turned off all the lights and got rid of any light that's coming in, what color
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.880]   would this be?
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:32.840]   There is no color because the color that we see, what are we seeing?
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.040]   It's a light being reflected off of this material.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.480]   It's just that some of the material reflects yellow.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.440]   Some of the material reflects red or whatever it is.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.120]   But whatever we are seeing is not this.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.240]   We're seeing the light being reflected off of this, right?
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.160]   I checked this with eye doctors and I'm correct, okay?
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.800]   Just I googled it and I talked to them after the first service.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.400]   For some reason, all the eye doctors came to the first service, okay?
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.760]   So what we are seeing, everything that we are seeing is a reflection of the light coming
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.760]   off of that.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.120]   Whatever it is that you see, whatever color you see against the wall, the floor, all of
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.160]   that is light bouncing off of whatever material is coming off of that.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.560]   And that's what he says in the psalmist.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.440]   He says, "In your light, we see light."
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:23.520]   Until Christ lights up our life, until he opens our eyes, until we recognize he is our
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   light, everything else remains in darkness.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.400]   Third and fourth, I'm going to put together.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.000]   Paul says, "I am the gate."
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.400]   And then the fourth "I am" statement, he says, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.800]   And the reason why I'm putting this together is because the point that he's making is a
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.560]   similar point and also the context is a very similar context.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.120]   The context of which he says this and what he's trying to deal with is in the context
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:58.800]   of John chapter 9 where this man who was born blind all his life, he's never seen sight.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   And so Jesus comes and has compassion on him and heals him and sends him to the Pool of
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.680]   Siloam and puts mud on his eyes and he miraculously opens his eyes.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.760]   And you have these Jewish leaders who have determined to get rid of Jesus already.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.280]   They already hated him and nothing that Jesus was going to say or do was going to change
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   their mind.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.800]   And then all of a sudden they hear that this blind man's eyes were open and people were
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.480]   going to Jesus and giving him glory.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.000]   And so they wanted to knit this at the butt.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.360]   So they bring in the blind man and said, "You weren't really born blind.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   This is all a trickery.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.000]   No man can open your eyes."
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And he said, "I don't know.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.080]   I don't know why you ask me, but all I do know is I was blind and now I see."
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.360]   And they said, "Okay, well, let me get your parents.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   Maybe you're lying to us."
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.120]   They call the parents in and they ask the parents, "Was your son really born blind?"
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:52.620]   And they are already in fear of these leaders because they have the power to cast them out
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   of the synagogue.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.480]   And you have to understand what that means.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:02.760]   If you were a blind or a leper or any kind of defect in your life, they automatically
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.120]   assume that it wasn't just physical.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.320]   They just automatically assume there's going to be some kind of sin in your life or your
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.280]   parents or something must have, you must have done something wrong for God to punish you
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   like that.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.160]   Kind of like Job's friends, right?
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.200]   God doesn't punish the righteous.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.440]   This happened because you did something wrong.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.600]   So as a result of that, there was no compassion for those who are blind.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.180]   So the only way that they can survive is to be outside begging for food.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.640]   And even the parents had no other way to take care of him.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.360]   So he was basically, if you had any kind of defect, you were cast out.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:40.600]   And the parents knew this, that if they crossed these men, that they can kick them out and
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.320]   they can't get a job, they'll lose their standing in society.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.840]   Whatever it is that they had, once you get cast out of the synagogue, the whole community
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.160]   is going to cut you off.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   So in fear of that, they backtrack.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.360]   It's like, "Well, you know, that is our son, but if you really want to know, you're going
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.840]   to have to ask him."
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.960]   So they deflect the responsibility toward the son.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.400]   The son comes back, the man comes back, and he has this conversation with them in John
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.920]   chapter 9, verse 24.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.360]   You don't have to turn there, but just look what he says.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.040]   So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind, said to him, "Give glory
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.040]   to God.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.000]   We know that this man is a sinner."
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.600]   He answered, "Whether he is a sinner, I do not know.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.240]   One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   I don't know.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.840]   Again, he's saying, "You're asking me, you're asking my parents, now you brought me back
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.200]   and he kind of already knows their motive.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.740]   They're not seeking truth.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.240]   They're trying to get at Jesus."
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.800]   And he said, "I can't deny, like I don't know all this theology.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   I didn't study.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.240]   I don't know the laws, but I can just tell you, I was blind.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.440]   I know you're trying to discredit that, but I was blind, but now I see."
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.120]   They said to him, "What did he do to you?
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.400]   How did he open your eyes?"
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.560]   He answered them, "I have told you already and you would not listen.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.960]   Why do you want to hear it again?
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960]   Do you also want to become his disciple?"
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.040]   I'm like, "My, think about the boldness of this guy.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   This guy was a beggar all his life and he's talking to the leaders of the community who
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.480]   can literally ruin his life again."
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   So think about his boldness.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:20.000]   If you were a blind man and all you could do to survive was to beg, for the first time
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.820]   you open your eyes, now you can live a normal life.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.880]   And for him to live a normal life, he needed to be accepted by these men.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   He knows what it means.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.080]   His parents knew and that's why they were afraid of him.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.800]   But him, if they cast him out, he would be cast out completely.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.480]   So the very thing that he probably wanted all his life, to be normal, to be accepted,
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:46.800]   to be able to be in the synagogue, to walk into the temple and give worship to God, if
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.160]   they cast him out, all of that would be taken away from him.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   He would have the exact same life, except that he could see.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.520]   And yet he stands up to them.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.160]   He sees exactly what they are doing and in his boldness say, "I know exactly what you
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.160]   are doing.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.520]   Do you want to be his disciple too?"
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.160]   And clearly they get ticked off in verse 28.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.480]   And they reviled him saying, "You are his disciples, but we are disciples of Moses.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.120]   We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   from."
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.540]   And the blind man answered, "Why, this is an amazing thing.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.280]   You do not know where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:29.320]   We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.400]   his will, God listens to him.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.040]   Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of the man born
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.640]   blind.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.720]   If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.360]   Again, here is a guy, probably he was born blind all his life.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.560]   He had no study, probably knew very little of theology.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.840]   He's lecturing these men who are probably scholars of the Torah and he's telling them
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.360]   who God is.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.040]   Who was the one who was blind?
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.800]   He was physically blind, but the men clearly were blind.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.840]   He's instructing them about who God is.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.760]   And as a result of that, they answered him, verse 34, "You were born into utter sin, and
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.360]   would you teach us?"
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.400]   And they cast him out.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:24.000]   It is in that context Jesus shows up and he tells this man who's been just cast out, who
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.760]   stood up to these false shepherds.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:35.120]   And he's encouraging him and telling him, "I am the door that all these sheep were trying
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.600]   so hard to be accepted by these men.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.800]   Don't worry about them.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   Have courage.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.920]   I am the door.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   I am the gate.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.280]   The gate that they just kicked you out of, don't worry about that.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.840]   I am the gate.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.520]   They take you outside the city, I am outside the city.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.400]   All these people are living in fear of these false shepherds.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.640]   I am the good shepherd."
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:03.280]   He's giving this man courage, even though on the surface it may seem like you lost everything.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.760]   You gained everything because you believe in me.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.640]   That's what he means when he says he is the gate.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.600]   He says in 1 Timothy 2.5, "For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.200]   and men, the man Christ Jesus."
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.120]   There's no other way for life.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.480]   He didn't give us many different ways to come to him.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.960]   He is the way and the truth and the life.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.480]   No one comes to the Father but through him.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.040]   He is our door.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.340]   He is our shepherd.
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:38.960]   As much as I would like to say that I am the shepherd of this church, I am not.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.640]   I'm a sinful man with selfish desires, just like you.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:50.120]   And the best that I can do is to point you to the good shepherd.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:57.680]   The best that I can do as an underling for the real shepherd is to tell you who he is
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.380]   and what he has done.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.040]   In John 10, 14 to 18, Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.780]   I know my own, and my own know me.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:14.400]   Just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father, I lay down my life for the sheep."
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.980]   Any other shepherd that comes into your life, any other place that you put confidence, when
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:28.400]   it no longer benefits them, when you no longer benefit them, they will leave.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:38.100]   Friendships, parents, even your own children, because there's only one shepherd who will
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.660]   lay down his life for us.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.300]   And that's exactly what he did.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.740]   And I have other sheep that are not of this fold.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:50.780]   I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice, so there will be one flock, one
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.260]   shepherd.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:57.580]   For this reason, the Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.300]   No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own accord.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.960]   I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.640]   This charge I have received from my Father.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.940]   There is no shepherd that knows your pain like the good shepherd.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:24.220]   There is no shepherd that will be as patient with your faults as the good shepherd.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:30.420]   There is nobody who knows your crying in the dark.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.260]   No one knows your anxieties, no one knows your concerns, no one knows your background
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.940]   as much as the good shepherd.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:44.180]   It is to our detriment that we put our confidence in anyone, anything, any system outside of
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:49.260]   Christ.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:57.740]   When we think of 2017, could you say that you pursued Christ?
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:03.460]   Knowing what we know of Christ, and we're only halfway through, how much of our faith
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:09.900]   is reflective of the superficial faith of people who follow Christ, where we have one
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:17.240]   eye toward Him and one eye toward the world, working so hard to have it all.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:23.300]   Knowing full well that God said, "You cannot have it."
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:30.140]   Either you believe Him and follow Him, or you don't believe Him and embrace the world.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.080]   He is the good shepherd.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.240]   He lays down His life for us.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.600]   He hears our prayers in darkness.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.160]   He is our refuge.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.700]   He is our strength.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.140]   He is our insurance.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.680]   He is our comfort.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.080]   He is our provider.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.680]   He is our Lord.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.980]   Every year, at the end of the year, we think about 2017, what happened, and then we plan
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.220]   for the 2018.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.740]   All of that ultimately, isn't it about our life?
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.140]   How do we live in 2017?
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.580]   And we evaluate that so that we can live better in 2018.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:08.660]   So we make resolutions.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:14.520]   And yet Jesus said, the very reason why He came is to give us life.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:20.940]   I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.340]   So every year we evaluate.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.820]   Every year we look at, well, what are the things that we are pursuing?
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.720]   And again, and I want to encourage you not to just like, okay, we're pursuing Christ
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.440]   because I'm committed to the church and I'm a member of this church and I'm doing these
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.260]   covenantal things.
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.620]   You can do all of that and not be pursuing Christ.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.380]   And you know that.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:49.100]   As Paul said, forgetting what is behind, straining toward what is ahead.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:57.900]   I want our church, as we again are looking at the last year of 2017, to not just to be
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:05.620]   hearers of the word, not to just be good Christians on Sunday, and not just be committed Christians
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:13.340]   when you are with church members, but to examine every aspect of our lives and to see if Christ's
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.140]   our bread, is Christ our light?
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.580]   Do we believe He's the gate?
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.600]   Do we believe He's the good shepherd?
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:30.340]   And that the answer to everything that I wrestle with is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:38.500]   That you would believe this as the primary pursuit of your life and to live that truth
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.160]   as passionately as we can.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.740]   We are not in this world permanently.
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.380]   We are here temporarily.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.860]   We are sojourners who will come like a mist and disappear tomorrow.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:49:01.980]   And so for this short period of life, to live as passionately as we can, pursuing Christ,
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:07.860]   not simply because you can live, not simply because that's what's best for you, but because
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:15.460]   He put us as light in darkness, because there is a world that is also going to live for
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.460]   a short period.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.100]   But when they die, they don't have heaven waiting for them.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.600]   When they die, there's a second death waiting for them.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:33.980]   So for this short period of life, put away the sin that so easily entangles.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:40.620]   Put away the temptations that you've had your eyes on and you just refuse to let go.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.240]   Put away the sin of temptation.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.720]   Put away the pride.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.520]   Put away your treasures that you've allowed in your heart and said it was okay.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:58.440]   And recognize and pray to God, "Open my eyes to see how fleeting my life is.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.140]   I am only here for a short period."
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.780]   Whether you are in your teens, whether you are in your fifties or sixties or seventies,
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.580]   we are only here for a short period.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.120]   Give your life to Jesus.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.660]   And I know I'm talking to the church.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.500]   And I know I'm talking to our members.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.780]   And I know I'm talking to a lot of you who've been raised in the church, who give faithfully
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.940]   and who are faithful members of Berean Community Church.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:29.220]   And I'm asking you and I'm pleading with you.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:33.820]   In 2018, give your life to Jesus.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.860]   Give it to Him.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.420]   Let Him be your shepherd.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   Let Him be the gate.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.820]   Let Him be your treasure.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.060]   Let Him be your bread.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.860]   Let Him be your light.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.020]   And let's stop messing around with this world.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.020]   It's fleeting.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.580]   A nuclear bomb may go off, it might end.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.580]   A world war happen, it might end.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.380]   You may get in a car crash, it may end.
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.420]   We don't have forever.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.860]   Let's pray the same prayer of the psalmist.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:08.100]   Let me see how short this life is, so that whatever it is I've been pursuing may be seen
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   with eternity.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.100]   And to believe.
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.580]   Believe.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.900]   Believe with all your heart.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:33.580]   Would you take some time to pray with me?
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:40.300]   Let me pray for us and then I'm going to ask you to continue to pray on your own.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:48.860]   Heavenly Father, we are sheep who is in desperate need of a shepherd.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.980]   Open our ears, Father.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:56.620]   We have become too comfortable with our surroundings.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:02.860]   We have relied too much, Lord God, upon our finances, upon our government, upon where
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:09.940]   we live, upon the assurances of our bosses for our future and our companies.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:15.940]   We've relied too much upon the promises of this world.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:21.220]   The only full well that God of this age is our enemy.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:26.060]   I pray, Father God, that you would renew genuine faith.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:34.300]   Help us, Lord God, to cut through the superficialness of our worship, of our dedication.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.580]   We want you, Jesus.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.940]   We want to know you.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.940]   We want to love you.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:42.900]   We want to worship you.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.600]   We want the whole world to know what you've done.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.740]   That there is hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:55.300]   That you would raise up people, Father God, for the harvest.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.100]   As a harvest is truly plentiful and the workers are few.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:04.580]   We beseech you, Father, to send more workers into this harvest.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.640]   We ask for revival.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.660]   We ask, Lord God, that you would search us and know us.
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:16.220]   And you know, Father God, better than we do, our sins, the compromises that we make and
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.180]   how that frustrates us in coming to you.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.100]   I pray, Father God, that you would raise up a church that will pray and to confess and
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.340]   to be honest, that we would have genuine faith.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:33.300]   That Paul's testimony of willing to suffer, that he may know you, may not simply be something
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.820]   that we admire, but our own testimony.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:43.740]   So we pray, Father God, what we are unable to do, that you would do.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.740]   Answer our prayers.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.900]   In Jesus' name, amen.
