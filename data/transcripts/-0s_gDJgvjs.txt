[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.240]   Let's get situated.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.920]   And in 30 seconds, we will pray to begin our last segment
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560]   in the Book of Jude.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   So let's go ahead and settle in.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.140]   OK, please join with me in a word of prayer.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.220]   Our God, we want to give you thanks tonight.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.260]   We want to continue to lift up to you
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.740]   grateful hearts for the life you give to us
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.220]   and the everyday blessings you grant to us
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.140]   in the name of your Son.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.180]   We do pray for a truly edifying time
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180]   of having fellowship over your word,
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.860]   looking intently at your scripture truth
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.660]   with insight, with illumination.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.660]   But I pray also that in all things,
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.900]   by us delighting in what you've given to us,
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.700]   by us having such receptive hearts and attitudes,
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.260]   it would be honoring and glorifying in your sight
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.540]   that ultimately be pleasing, Lord, in your eyes,
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.900]   where God, your children are eagerly
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.180]   looking for your wisdom, your authority, your guidance
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.500]   over us, knowing, God, that your will truly is to our best.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.740]   So God, also as we join our hearts and words and songs
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.940]   to praise you and lift you up, we
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.860]   pray, God, that in all these things you would be honored.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.180]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.680]   Amen.

[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.660]   Just want to highlight a few announcements for us.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.220]   Just some important dates you want to note down is that
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.860]   Saturday, March 4th, we're having our All Church Cleaning
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.340]   and Maintenance Day.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.780]   So mark that on your calendar and sign up.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.420]   Additionally, for our Bible study purposes,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.980]   Friday 3/10 is going to be our praise and prayer,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.980]   the first break we'll have in our Bible study schedule.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.740]   So that Wednesday we won't be meeting, okay?
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.140]   So next week will be the start of 2/3 John,
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.580]   followed by Pastor Peter.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.340]   And then the week following is going to be the praise and
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.820]   prayer Friday.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.820]   So make sure you just note that on your calendar, okay?
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.420]   And then an important announcement for those of you
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.500]   guys in our singles, BAM Ministries,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.100]   who signed up for the retreat and were so excited to go see
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   snow, there is too much snow.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.500]   We were waiting until the last minute because we were trying,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.140]   we knew it was going to snow and then,
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.340]   we were trying to wait for the forecast to turn in our favor.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.660]   We were hearing that there was only three inches of snow the
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.980]   first day of the storm, something like that with the
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.180]   plows and going the more easy route we can get there.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.580]   But the forecast now says on Friday it will snow up to a foot
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.220]   and a half to two feet of snow.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.860]   So that's not going to do and it's going to be 20 degrees.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.940]   And so trying to leave on Friday is going to be impossible.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.980]   So that being the case, please know that we're not going to go
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.300]   up to the campsite.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.100]   You guys are going to get messages for Audible.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.300]   We're going to have the retreat nevertheless because we still
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.060]   have our speaker.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.580]   He's going to be great and we're going to have it here at church.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.580]   We're going to worship.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.580]   We're going to learn.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.580]   It's going to be a great time of fellowship.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.220]   So look out for notices.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.740]   Look out for announcements to come and just know that's going
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.900]   on for this weekend, okay?
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.460]   Alright.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.860]   The rest of the announcements and such,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.500]   you guys can take a look on your apps.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.500]   You can go into your guys' discussion and we'll come back at 8.

[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:21.820]   Alright, for those of you guys in the room, this would be a good time to make your way out
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.820]   to the main area to go over the study.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.820]   [no audio]

[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:51.820]   Okay, so apologies for my voice.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:56.820]   I'm thankfully just recovering. I got over a weird cold.
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:01.820]   I'm all better now. Thankfully no snot and sinus,
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.820]   and so now everything I say sounds profound.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:11.820]   Alright, so I'm not sure if I see some of the groups out from the back rooms.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:16.820]   If you can signal them if you're back there. Let's take a moment to pray
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.820]   as we jump in. Lord,
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:26.820]   God, it is our prayer that we not
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   fall into the typical temptation, I guess you could say pattern,
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:36.820]   where your word becomes somehow insignificant,
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.820]   somehow overplayed, and God, dismissible in our eyes.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.820]   Lord, I pray that we would never come to a place of complaining that
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:51.820]   we do this week in and week out, but rather help us to be those
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:56.820]   who cling to every single word you say. I pray, Father God,
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:01.820]   that our hearts would learn to love and cherish
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:06.820]   your instruction as a loving Father gives to us, but also
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   because Jude is trying to teach us, help us to be wise in such a way that our eyes
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   are actually open and we see the dangerous world that we live in.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.820]   Also, the dangers of the flesh in which we live and we see, Father God,
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.820]   that we desperately need your protection, your Spirit's power, and more.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.820]   And the hope that you give according to your truth. So, Father, we thank you so much for your word
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   tonight. It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:41.820]   So, as we take a look
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:46.820]   at our overview of the letter that we have been studying,
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:51.820]   we saw Jude's purpose for us. He said, "I wanted to write you
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.820]   so much about the common faith we have, but I felt the necessity
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:01.820]   to warn you because there are people who have crept in."
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:06.820]   And he wanted to tell us, "You have to contend for this faith."
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.820]   And then, the bulk, just the sheer bulk of 12 plus
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:16.820]   verses, 12 and more, of the description of the warning given to us
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:21.820]   that there are such ungodly people who have come into the midst of the congregation.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:26.820]   They operate in the same pattern as did many sinful people of the past,
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.820]   yet their destruction is certain. And we can be rest assured
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.820]   that God knows how to spare, and God knows how to judge.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:41.820]   Verse 17 through 23, he gave us exhortation to keep building up
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.820]   this faith. He gave us exhortation to keep ourselves in the love of God,
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:51.820]   and to also keep others. And then we end today with this doxology.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:56.820]   Verse 24 and 25, which says, "Now to him who is
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:01.820]   able to keep you from stumbling, and able to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.820]   blameless with great joy, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:11.820]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   and now and forever. Amen." So as we take a look at this,
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:21.820]   we could summarize it, if we were to summarize into one singular phrase, it would simply be,
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:26.820]   "To God who is able be all glory." Okay?
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.820]   To God who is able be all glory. So when we take a look at this last segment,
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:36.820]   verse 24 to 25, it probably is so familiar to you guys, because both Pastor Peter
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:41.820]   and I, we love reading this at the very end of the sermon. It's an amazing
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.820]   summary of how powerful God is, how deserving
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:51.820]   he is, right? And so that's why we call it a doxology. What is
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:56.820]   a doxology? You guys probably heard that term here and there. You know, you see it at the top of the
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.820]   heading of your Bibles. Doxology simply just actually means a
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:06.820]   word of glory. Dox is the Greek word for glory, andology is just the word,
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:11.820]   right? So there are many other passages in Scripture
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.820]   that speak in kind of magnificent terms, elaborative
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.820]   terms of the greatness of our God. And it typically,
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:26.820]   not always, but typically comes at the end of a section where the author has been
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.820]   expounding and explaining and going through details of, "Do you see
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.820]   how good God is? Do you see his gospel?" And then he breaks into
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:41.820]   a word of praise, basically. One such example is Romans 16.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.820]   It says, "Now to him who is able to establish you according to my
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.820]   gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifest, and by
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:01.820]   the Scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.820]   known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith, to the only
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.820]   wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:16.820]   Amen." Here's another one, because it's so good.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:21.820]   Hebrews 13, it says, "Now the God of peace, who brought up from the
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.820]   dead the great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:31.820]   even Jesus our Lord, equip you in every good thing to do his
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:36.820]   will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.820]   Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:46.820]   Okay? And so in this way, we have many pastoral
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:51.820]   scriptures that essentially say, "To God be the glory forever and ever."
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   And it reminds me of when I got saved as a young senior in
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.820]   high school, they had at the church, a Korean church, at the end of the service, that like
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   singing of the, you know, "Praise God from whom all blessings flow."
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:11.820]   Okay? I can't sing right now. What am I doing? But then it kind of
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.820]   crescendos into, right, that all glory, all power,
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.820]   to God forever and ever. Amen. And then it's so powerful.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.820]   You know? And for us, we take a moment to just think about at the end of a letter like this,
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.820]   it is interesting to be like, "Woe to you guys,
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:36.820]   because there is creepers who have come in, dangerous men,
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.820]   apostate men, and they follow their lust, they're arrogant, they're deceivers."
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:46.820]   And this goes on. And at the end of that, just a breakout in praise.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:51.820]   Okay? So I want you guys to kind of think about,
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:56.820]   what does it mean to really give God glory then?
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:01.820]   We've heard the idea, the book of Ephesians tells you, "Bless the Lord." Right?
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:06.820]   So what does that mean? Okay? The immediate
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.820]   word association to praise God or glorify God
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:16.820]   would automatically translate to just sing and sing and sing.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:21.820]   Does singing glorify God? And the answer is yes. Okay? But beyond that,
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   in terms of your state of mind, in terms of the content and the
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:31.820]   sanctuary of your head, what is contained in the content of your thoughts,
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:36.820]   in the way you express your views, the words that you use,
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:41.820]   and in the actions that you decide on doing, what does it mean to glorify God?
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:46.820]   Right? And I want to just share one of the interesting things,
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:51.820]   as I remember early on when I was a Christian, there was this overly dramatic gentleman
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   who was my teacher. And what was so funny is that every time he would get the youth group
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:01.820]   to go to a school, he would be very critical. And he knew some of us were
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:06.820]   essentially lying or we weren't telling the full truth. He would always look at us and say,
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   "Tell the truth. Shame the devil." Right? Not in that voice, but something similar.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.820]   Right? He'd say, "You tell the truth. Shame the devil." But also he would say, "You tell the truth.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:21.820]   Glory to God." Right? And was he just being a charismatic? Was he just
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:26.820]   being a charismatic? No, he was making perfect sense.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:31.820]   You either make Satan nice and proud because you're hiding yourself, you're not telling the full truth,
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:36.820]   you're not being forthright. Right? Or the flip.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:41.820]   Because it only makes sense to be broken, truthful, and honest because you trust God, you glorify Him.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.820]   And it was kind of really interesting that he made a connection and drew a line
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.820]   every time he challenged us to do something because this is the will of God.
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:56.820]   Right? But I want you to think. We're ending with a passage that tells like,
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   "Glory to God." And if we just end with, "Yeah, next time I sing,
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.820]   I'm just going to sing a little louder." I'm not sure if we're going to be able
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:11.820]   to apply this passage in its full extent. Right? So meditate on that.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:16.820]   But if we take a look at the full of the text,
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   in thinking about all that's contained, what we can tell just from my color coding,
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.820]   I hope it helps you guys when I do this, is that,
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:31.820]   yes, we're supposed to give glory to God, but in relationship to some of the other ones
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:36.820]   that I showed you, the book of Romans, clearly, he centered the book of Romans
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.820]   doxology on the glory of God because of the revelation of the gospel.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:46.820]   And the book of Romans happens to be such an emphatic book on the explanation
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:51.820]   of the gospel truth. The book of Hebrews, if you want to talk about a book
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:56.820]   that connects the dots for you on the covenant of God, that's the book you go to.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:01.820]   Well, guess what? He ends the book with that connection. Here, what's really interesting is,
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.820]   amidst all the troubles, he focuses our attention on the one who is able.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.820]   Right? As we think about giving glory to God,
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:16.820]   there is this question of, do you trust truly in your heart and have faith
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:21.820]   that yes, with man, all things impossible, but with God,
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   there is nothing impossible. He is fully able to keep us amidst
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   all of this. And so, let's move to the very first section.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   If I were to break it up, I would say verse 24 has to him who is able
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   as the centerpiece. And so we think about this idea that he is clearly able
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:46.820]   to keep. And yes, it's the same word that he uses when he challenges
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:51.820]   you to keep yourself. And I mentioned it is a very descriptive word
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.820]   because he is watching and guarding, securing and preserving.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:01.820]   But it is often used at the top of the dictionary entry, it was most often used
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:06.820]   as to guard something, even as a guard guards a prisoner. Yes?
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:11.820]   And he guards you from stumbling. And he's also able to make you stand.
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:16.820]   First, I want to ask an interesting question just for your guys' thought is,
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   so clearly here, oops, sorry, the pen's there, okay.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:26.820]   There's this idea of to keep you. And then there is this thought of stumbling,
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   and we should ask, like, I know if we were to do a track record,
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:36.820]   meaning you just start tallying how many times you sin in the month,
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:41.820]   like, some of us would be like, well, I'm not exactly sure how he's keeping me
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:46.820]   from sinning, meaning daily mistakes, errors and sins.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.820]   But is that what he's talking about when he says stumbling? Right?
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.820]   Daily mishaps and sins. Or is he talking about an ultimate kind of falling away?
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   Something to think about. But nevertheless, I want us to just keep in,
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:07.820]   like, mind the context. Lately, what's been interesting is that there's been
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:12.820]   a lot of people feeling this eerie sense of, oh, my goodness, the end is near.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:17.820]   Right? Because everything that we've been seeing around us in context of just,
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.820]   like, how the scriptures describe the end times, it talks about everybody's
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.820]   going to be really angry. Everyone's going to be very greedy.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.820]   Children will be haters of parents. People will be lovers of self,
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.820]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And then what's more, scripture has told us
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:36.820]   as the end gets closer and closer and closer, the church itself,
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.820]   it's going to look like the seven churches in the book of Revelations.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:47.820]   Whether it's all compromised, form without spirit and power.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:52.820]   And so there is this bleak outlook. But even in the midst of all of these
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.820]   threats, attacks of apostates, false teachers, even though that laundry list
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:02.820]   of character traits that we saw was, truthfully speaking, was so overwhelming
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.820]   we couldn't keep track of all of them, God says, "Do you understand?
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.820]   I am going to preserve and keep you." So yes, in the midst of all that
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:16.820]   and also in the end of all that. And what's pretty amazing is 1 Peter
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.820]   describes it very similarly, where he talks about for us, we're going to
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, will not fade,
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.820]   reserved in heaven for you, you who are protected by the power of God
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:36.820]   through faith for our salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:42.820]   Right? So that's 1 Peter 1, 3 to 5. And so in thinking about all that,
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.820]   I think this is something we should just put a stake down and say,
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.820]   "Man, do I ever struggle with this weary thought, like, 'Oh my gosh,
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:57.820]   where is the world headed?' And do you also have any sentiment where you
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:05.820]   have this heart in you that is already defeated? 'Ah, I'm going to struggle,
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:09.820]   always struggle, and then I'm just going to squeeze by.'" You know?
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:15.820]   This is it. The challenge to you is hear God's word that He is actually
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.820]   going to, here, go to the next one, also make you stand.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.820]   He's going to make you stand where? In the presence, and I believe this idea
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.820]   of also with great joy is supporting this idea of how He's going to,
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:34.820]   okay, make you stand. And we think about this as a means to appreciate
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:41.820]   what He's saying. I want you to do the whole, like, envision together, right?
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:47.820]   Envision together me asking you, "Hey, I wanted to use as an example
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.820]   for my sermon and illustration somebody who's just a great, great church man
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:56.820]   and church woman, an example and model of faith. Can I ask you to come stand
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:00.820]   with me on the pulpit?" Okay? Just picture with me, okay?
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:06.820]   How many of you would be like, "Yeah, let me be the sermon illustration
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.820]   for you, Pastor Mark." Right? I'm guessing nobody.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:15.820]   You would automatically be like, "No, no, no, no. I have a fear of public speaking.
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:20.820]   No, no, no, no. You could use somebody else." And for sure, I'm not like
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.820]   the prime example. There's other people, da, da, da, da, da, and you'll name off others.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.820]   Right? We don't even like being stood in front of our friends, okay?
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:33.820]   That's what I'm talking about. God Himself is the greatest quality control.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:38.820]   He's the greatest judge. He has the most piercing eyes, and He sees through all.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:44.820]   Right? And so for Him to say, "I am going to make you stand before the glory of God
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:50.820]   with not incredible fear and dread that you're just going to be spotted
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:56.820]   for all that you are, but that you're going to be presented before God with joy,"
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:01.820]   that's crazy. Right? That's so amazing.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:08.820]   And so I wanted to encourage our hearts that this has been the heart of God,
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:14.820]   where He has said that He has His ambition. In Ephesians 5, the description of the role
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.820]   of the husband was to nourish, cherish, wash, and present, holy, blameless,
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:25.820]   in all her splendor, the church. And that has been Christ's agenda.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:31.820]   And then Christ said, "I will accomplish it without losing a single one." Amen?
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:39.820]   Next, we take a look at the middle section, and we see that there is kind of like
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:44.820]   just a reiteration. Right? It says, "To Him," and then it goes on to say,
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.820]   "To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:54.820]   Now, within this text, there's nothing new. And so it's kind of like,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   "Hmm, I don't know how to pull observations from verse 25a."
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.820]   So I'm just going to say, "To God be the glory," and I was about to pass, honestly.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.820]   But then I started saying, "No, I'm going to try to think about each word."
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:13.820]   And then you start realizing, well, clearly there is this idea of the only God,
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.820]   and in our day, to say He is the only way, there is only one God,
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:25.820]   that's like fighting terms. Right? If you say we have the only truth,
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:31.820]   the only revelation that will ever save you, you are an exclusive arrogant man.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:37.820]   And what's more, if you talk about nowadays our Savior, I saw a hilarious thing.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:42.820]   About nowadays our Savior, I saw a hilarious thing.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.820]   His name was Benjamin Watson. He's a pro football player.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.820]   And it was already old. It's like five years old.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:54.820]   But he was talking about how, hey, there's not necessarily like a social problem
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.820]   there's a sin problem. The reason why we're so angry at each other
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.820]   is because there's sin in our hearts. And then he started to say,
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.820]   "But I believe that our only solution is not just simply government and policies,
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.820]   I believe it's Jesus Christ." And the screen went green. It was like static.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:13.820]   And the announcer was like, "Oh, just like that, we lost him."
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.820]   He got cut off. And I thought that was hilarious.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:23.820]   That the pushing of Jesus as a solution to our societal woes is silenced in our day.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:30.820]   This is fighting terms to say, "No, no, no, no. You need a Savior like I need a Savior."
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.820]   It has to be through Jesus Christ. There is no only way. And guess what?
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.820]   He is Lord. A primary description of God. Right?
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:44.820]   He is, and then we're going to study later, He is the creator. He owns everything.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:48.820]   Guess what? He is the control. He is sovereign. He is Lord.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.820]   Unfortunately, we live in a generation where Jesus, He is depicted as
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:58.820]   the one who is our friend, the one who is our comforter, which is true.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:03.820]   But the primary anticipation in our hearts when we think about Jesus coming back is
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:11.820]   Jesus is coming back with splendor, majesty, power, reign.
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.820]   Jesus is coming back as king over your life. Yes?
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.820]   And so what I did was I said, "You know, every single one of these words,
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:27.820]   it describes a way by which we can actually fight every falsehood that faces us today."
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:32.820]   Every single word, it was pretty amazing that he wanted to talk about the gospel
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:38.820]   and the common faith that we have, and then he did it in two phrases.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:43.820]   That the consideration of, like, if there is somebody who wants to teach you something,
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:49.820]   if there happens to be an event, you have to ask, "Does this give attention to God or to us?"
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:55.820]   If there is an event or a movement, you have to ask, "Is it exclusive to the one true God
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:02.820]   or are we catering to everybody?" You know, everybody of all faith, we are equally welcome.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:09.820]   Does it involve your personal conversion where it has to be my savior?
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.820]   Does it actually adjust the fact as a necessity for exaltation because our greatest problem in this life
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:22.820]   is not societal woes, our greatest problem is that my sin deserves God's wrath.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:29.820]   And then you can just go down the list. Every single one of these, our generation will see as contentious words,
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:38.820]   and therefore, every single one of these words presents to us a way by which we can truly contend for the faith.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:50.820]   Next. In the last segment, that to him must be all glory, describes that he is deserving,
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:58.820]   or I guess to him be, and there's a question for you there. We don't talk like that, okay, normally, right?
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:06.820]   Even if we're talking about, I guess, human characters, lately, because LeBron became the highest-scoring player
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:12.820]   in the NBA ever, everyone started to say, "Man, this guy truly is the GOAT," and there has been debates.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:17.820]   "No, no, no, you fool, Michael Jordan's the GOAT." It's like, "No, no, no, LeBron's the GOAT," you know?
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:26.820]   But you would never say, "To LeBron be the glory," you know? You would never say, like, "To LeBron be the recognition."
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:38.820]   Like, who talks like that? So we have to ask, in what way to be God are all of these descriptions, or I guess possessions,
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   or I guess, and it kind of makes you think, right? To have glory, majesty, dominion, and authority,
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:52.820]   and it would be good for you to, I hope you guys at least took one of these words and did the whole definition thing,
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:57.820]   or where else are they used? And then you realize, "Oh my gosh, it's like everywhere," you know?
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:06.820]   Obviously, it's in Revelation multiple times, the angels are singing. For example, let's see here.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:13.820]   The angels are singing in Revelation 5, right? The elders are singing, the creatures are singing.
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:22.820]   Just as an example from Revelation 5, 11, he says, "I looked, I heard the voice of many angels around the throne,
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:30.820]   living creatures, elders, the number of myriads, myriads, thousands, thousands, saying with a loud voice,
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:40.820]   'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing,
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:45.820]   in every created thing which is in heaven and on earth, under the earth and the sea, all things in them,
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:52.820]   I heard them saying, 'To him who sits on the throne, be blessing, honor, glory, dominion forever and ever, amen.'"
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:23:00.820]   That was like an incredible, incredible vision. And so I thought about that for a moment, this idea of like,
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:13.820]   huh, that's pretty cool that through reading these other passages, you get a vision, you get a picture, right?
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:23.820]   And so it kind of begs the question, like, number one, I do think there is a potential pitfall where these terms
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:32.820]   are too big and lofty for us to connect with. It's just like, okay, majesty, dominion, and authority.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:41.820]   I know God's powerful, right? But there is this other question of like, do you have a kingdom vision,
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:51.820]   a vision like that, so glorious, where everything is perfectly right?
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:58.820]   Let me say that again, it's like, some of us, we want to fix various problems in the universe,
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:04.820]   and we want to fix a lot of the problems in our lives, but there is a high and lofty vision
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:11.820]   where everything is in its perfect place, and that vision is what I just read to you from Romans 5.
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:20.820]   Where every single creature is honoring the only individual who's truly worthy.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:27.820]   And we're saying exactly correct things, which is, look at how deserving this Lord is.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:34.820]   Look how beautiful he is. And so we're saying the truest, the most appropriate stuff,
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:40.820]   and we're not arguing about trivial things like, nah, you fool, Jordan's better, right?
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:49.820]   It's so trivial, so vain, and so menial. But it's kind of funny because, again, this is a knock on a lot of guys
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:56.820]   who are debating and stuff like that. Some of us are kind of offended. Are you stupid?
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:03.820]   Did you not see how good Jordan was? Did you not see how many opponents he took down?
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:10.820]   Did you not see his ambition, his prowess, his skill in every single, like, whatever,
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:16.820]   they can go on and off and off. But there's that question, like, do you have a vision of God
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:22.820]   that's so great that you'd be willing to say to other people, like, dude, you reject God right now,
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:29.820]   you're the fool. Do you have any idea how perfect this maker is? Do you have any idea how perfect
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   his patience is every season? Do you have any idea how glorious this God is?
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:43.820]   You know? So as I was reading that, I was like, man, like, if I had that vision,
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:51.820]   the implications that come from it, if I had that vision where I said my greatest ambition and goal
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   is to see God glorified in my life and yours, and truthfully speaking, in every form of discipleship,
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   whether it's the preaching from the pulpit, whether it's leadership training or biblical counseling,
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:12.820]   any form of discipleship, one of the number one goals is, dude, if you and I are not united
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:19.820]   on this one vision to first and foremost be about the high priority of glorifying God,
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:25.820]   then we're on two different, entirely separate paths. There's no discipleship here.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:31.820]   Every form, like in counseling, if I have somebody who's like, oh my gosh, like, you know,
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.820]   something tragic happened, and da da da da da, it's like, yes, you have my compassion, you have my,
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:41.820]   you know, all my empathy and sympathy that I can possibly muster, and you have the compassions of Christ.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:48.820]   But even in your crisis, if you and I are not set on the priority of the glory of God,
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:56.820]   we have no solution to this situation. Right? Why? Because if you have as your priority,
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:01.820]   as a number one goal, to remove all the pain from your heart and nothing else,
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:08.820]   then you'll never ever get there. Right? You're gonna miss the entire thing, which is Christ.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:15.820]   When he is glorified, when he is honored, when he has authority, when he has dominion,
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:23.820]   and he has all glory, all of your pains also diminish underneath that great, great glory of God.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:31.820]   And so I wanted to say that in so many ways, actually, this potentially, potentially,
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:41.820]   kind of lofty, hard to conceptualize, big old terminology words, has a huge ton of application
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:48.820]   in everyday scenario, because it becomes the greatest driving force of the things that we decide. Right?
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:54.820]   And between those decisions that we make in our lives, whether it's your dating, financial, right,
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:28:01.820]   whatever it is, practical, you will have to cross that question of, does this bring more glory to God?
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:08.820]   You have to. And based upon those answers, you end up applying some of the greatest wisdom
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:17.820]   for every scenario in life. And so, by a wrap up and review, we had before as a big, big chunk,
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:22.820]   you don't have to take notes on this, I sent you the PowerPoint, and it's just like, right?
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:27.820]   All the way starting from verse four, down to verse 16 and 17 and more,
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:36.820]   there were descriptions of the ungodly men. Ungodliness is around you. Okay? That was a warning.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:42.820]   And then the scripture in Jude told you, "Contend." And it told you to contend by remembering
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   and knowing all that's going to happen. It commanded you to contend by building up your faith,
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:52.820]   praying in the Spirit, keeping yourselves in the love of God, and keep looking.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   Show compassion towards the wavering. Seek urgently to rescue some, and use yourself, stay pure.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:05.820]   And in these last portions, it tells you, it told you, contend by trusting God's ability.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:10.820]   Contend by seeking His glory. Amen? Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:22.820]   Heavenly Father, we pray, God, that you would help us to see and recognize,
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:32.820]   Lord, that your calling for us was to glorify you whether I eat my dinner or not.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:40.820]   Your desire for us was to glorify you. Even in my drinking.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:45.820]   Even in taking a sip of whatever it was, attending this or that,
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:53.820]   the daily menial decisions that I think have no bearing, I was supposed to think about your glory.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:30:02.820]   And so I pray that you would help us to be so intentional and genuinely so considerate about you.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:07.820]   Father God, we live in a generation where so many pastors and teachers are so considerate of men
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:12.820]   that they are more than willing to simply hide you in the backseat.
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:16.820]   I pray, Father God, that we would say no to this generation,
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:23.820]   and we would place you as truly the first place, the head of the church,
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:28.820]   that God, you would have first and primacy place in everything.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:36.820]   I also pray, God, that you would guard us, truly guard us from the temptations of our enemy, the devil,
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:41.820]   that is content to have us nod our heads in agreement to facts.
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:47.820]   But I pray that your spirit will move us so that personally, God, we would surrender and be broken
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.820]   to all of your leading instruction for us.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:54.820]   We thank you, God, that's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:31:02.820]   Okay, so it's now 8.30, and as a highlight for you guys of just preparation for next week,
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:10.820]   we have second and third John, and again, I try to email you guys, and we'll post as a reminder as well.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:16.820]   Just do your broad reading so that you can highlight the themes and central exhortations.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:24.820]   Please make, compare and contrast, you know, I guess, of the similarities and differences with first John as well.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.820]   And then always be in the practice of summarizing, okay?
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   So that you can boil down teachings into a driving point.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:40.820]   Summarize second and third John, and then do your inductive process for verses one through three, okay?
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.820]   Second John one through three.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:53.820]   And then, as a discussion questions for the rest of the night, please again think about what does it mean to give glory to God?
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:57.820]   How can that express itself in your thoughts, words, and actions?
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:02.820]   Number two, for you personally, do you struggle with balancing your responsibility with God's power?
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:10.820]   And you know what that means, it's like, you had the exhortation, you keep yourself in the love of God.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:14.820]   And then the scripture says, God will keep you, okay?
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:21.820]   So does that mean that if you try your hardest, and you toil, and you cry over, you know, trying to keep yourself in the love of God,
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.820]   does that mean you don't trust?
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:30.820]   Like, what is the balance there, and how do I make sure I keep both in my understanding?
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.820]   And then number three, what are the implications?
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:39.820]   If we had God's glory and honor as the top priority in my life,
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.820]   what other implications, impacts would it have on the way I think and what I do?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.820]   Yes?
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:52.820]   So please take some time to discuss that, and then that'll wrap up our study in June.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.820]   All right, thanks everyone.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.820]   [end]
