[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.120]   So this is the accountability portion of this class. Alright, so number one, our
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:28.560]   mission is God's purpose. God's purpose. Number two, our passion is God's glory.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.400]   Number three, our heart is love and obedience. Number four, our evangelism is
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.920]   God-centered. Number five, our confidence is God's sovereignty. So pretty easy, right?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.200]   It was just the headings. So okay, and then number six, this was a little bit
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.080]   open-ended but there is an answer to it. What does it mean when we say that as
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.960]   evangelizers we must be careful to distinguish results from efforts? So the
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   idea or thought behind this one was that we're just simply meant to be
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.880]   faithful preachers of the Word. So we don't have to worry about the fruit of
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.960]   belief because that's on God. So number seven, in God-centered evangelism what is
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.280]   involved is not only integral but primary. The local church is correct,
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.520]   letter A. And then number eight, nine, and ten, just go ahead and answer those. And
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.800]   the extra credit, list out the four Greek evangelism words. Remember these? Let's go
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:45.720]   in order. The first one, the preach. Preach was uangelizo. The second one is
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.000]   teaching which was didasco. Didasco. Don't worry if you didn't get it. The
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.160]   English would be sufficient, right? Letter C, or the third one would be to
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.600]   herald or to proclaim or to invite which is keruso. And then the fourth
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:15.480]   one was the idea of witnessing. It sounds like martyreo. Okay, martyreo. So go
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.280]   ahead and uh, so each one of those, if you got the Greek words, if you got the
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.880]   English words you don't get a point. So you can write it, that's fine. But if you
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.880]   wrote it in the Greek and somewhat it sounds similar, you can give
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.920]   yourself an extra point for that. Hey, you're not turning these in. This is just
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.680]   for you. So point per. So it's possible 14. 14 out of 10.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   [Laughter]
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   Okay, so we're gonna be doing this every week. It is important to get here on time.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.360]   Today, I get it, 730 in the morning. So please, next week we're gonna go back to
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.080]   nine o'clock if you can try to get here at nine promptly so that we can grade
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.120]   the quizzes together. All right.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   Well, last week we went into the whole motivation and the heart behind
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.160]   evangelism. That is likely one of the more important concepts that you're
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.880]   gonna have to keep in mind. That our desire and our heart, where our motivation
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.360]   lies, if that's not there, everything else that we do for the next five classes, it
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.400]   won't matter. You'll learn and perhaps you can, well it'll matter in the sense
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   that you might be able to evangelize a little bit clearer or crisper, but you
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.120]   yourself, it might not be done out of a heart that actually honors the Lord.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.040]   So it actually says that in Isaiah chapter 44 and Isaiah chapter 55, God
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.200]   lists out all these things to the Israelites. He talks about oxen or cows
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.120]   and he talks about goats and then he talks about the grain offering and
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.720]   he lists all these things out and right next to it he puts, "Don't do this. It
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   actually is as if you were drinking swine's blood." For the Israelites, it was
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.000]   an act of worship. The way God received it, he said, "It's detestable." So
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.120]   everything that we do, although we live in the new covenant now, there is still
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.680]   the aspect of if we're not doing it for the right reason, if our heart is not in
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.600]   the right place, we have to question, like is God pleased in it? So that's why
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.220]   last week's class on motivation was so important. Today we're gonna go into the
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.180]   first of the four in the gospel presentation itself, which is God. This is
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.560]   the beginning of all of it, so the introduction. Although we can simplify
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   the gospel so that it's clear and understandable, we must not aim to reduce
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   the message of the gospel down to its minimalist form. Like any good teachers,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.360]   we are using various methods to help people understand the Christian worldview.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.960]   So the temptation is to not present the whole gospel and then I would say, I
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.720]   would kind of pose this, the opposite, there's another temptation in the
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   opposite direction, which is to just be in with the fear of trying to get the
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.600]   whole gospel, you just kind of list them out. And so tracks aren't bad, I think
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.320]   they're helpful sometimes. You know, many of you might have used like the four
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.800]   spiritual laws and things like that, but what you want to do is be able to be as
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.280]   comfortable with these four points as possible so that you can interact with
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.200]   people where they're at instead of saying, "Here, let's take you through this
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.720]   tract." Tracts are helpful, I'm not saying it's wrong or bad. Actually, they're
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.800]   probably beneficial, but for you to be as comfortable with the gospel and to be
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.360]   able to take it from different angles, like you could spin it around and it's
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.600]   like a globe, where you spin it around, put your finger somewhere and you know
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.120]   exactly where you are, and you know how to lead people into this kind of
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.880]   conversation. So there's going to be nothing new that comes out the next four
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.240]   weeks. So I don't know if you're disappointed, this is an evangelism
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   training course, but I think this really is the way to evangelize. So the first
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.280]   one is, "God is the creator." God is the creator.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:43.160]   Isaiah 44 24. Can we maybe start from Agnes and we'll go to Sue.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:54.440]   "Blessed is the Lord, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb. I am the Lord who makes all things, who stretches out the heavens all above, who spread the broad earth by myself."
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.960]   Okay, so this idea of God being creator is clear in Scripture, that's obvious.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:12.440]   Actually, Ariel, maybe you can read Revelation. "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power. For you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:20.280]   And then Marsha next. "1 Corinthians 10 26. For the earth is the Lord's and all its fullness."
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:30.080]   It's simple in our Christian worldview to just say God is the creator. But
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.760]   there is a difference between truthfulness and truth. Truthfulness is
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.960]   when you just learn Christian concepts, you learn truthful things. It's
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.160]   different when you yourself truly believe something to be truth. And for
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.200]   that to happen, you have to be able to defend it. Even something as simple
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.640]   as this. You can talk to an unbeliever and say, "Hey, God's the creator."
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.840]   You can say, "It's in the Bible." But you have to feel the confidence in, and even
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.600]   Scripture, is it going to be just because you learned it in church? You
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.280]   read it somewhere in the Bible? Remembering, even in Isaiah 44 when it
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.640]   says, "Blessed is the Lord, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb. I am the
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.320]   Lord who makes all things." It's so simple, but it gives you a lot of confidence in
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.080]   this fact. He makes all things. He stretches out the heavens all alone,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.280]   spreads abroad the earth by myself. God alone was creator. There was no one else.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.360]   There was nothing else. It was God. He created. We hammer each of these things
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.200]   down as concepts in our minds that are not just concepts, but a truth that we
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   individually believe. So there are ramifications to this. This is the
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.160]   beginning of the gospel, that God is the creator. It's not easy to
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.880]   always start with that, that God is creator. But this is our starting point.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.040]   And so, letter A, everything belongs to God. Everything has its origin and source
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.680]   in God. Everything belongs to God. Everything has its origin and source in
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   God. That is the ramification of God being creator. You could talk to
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:16.760]   unbelievers like this. If God creates, then the natural next thing is that
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.640]   everything that is created then belongs to Him. We have a hard time with this
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.960]   concept, but this isn't a hard concept. If you create something, it belongs to you.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   That's in our society. That's how we're wired. And so, if God is a creator, if
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.920]   they admit, "Yeah, I believe that God created the world," then you belong to Him.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.160]   That's the next natural ramification. Psalm 24. Let's go backwards.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   Go to Charlotte.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:59.360]   Okay, and then Psalm 50.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.600]   "For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.480]   birds of the mountains, and the wild beasts that field are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you. For the world is mine, and all is holy."
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.600]   Okay, remember last week we talked about the fact that it's very easy to get lost
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.660]   in man-centered gospel preaching. These thoughts are going to help you anchor
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.080]   this down. We don't shake on this. We're not ashamed of this
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   concept. That you belong to the Lord. You belong to Him. He created you. He gave you
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.680]   breath. He sustained you. He gives you heartbeat. He gives you the next day.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.840]   There is no living. In John 1.1, when it says, "In the
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.480]   beginning was the Word, and the Word was God," right after that,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.800]   it says that this being, who we later in verse 14 know to be Jesus,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   it says that He is the one that sustains life, and that through Him all things
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.880]   were created, and for Him all things are. That's what we find in Colossians
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:08.240]   chapter 1. Everything, just everything, all of creation is found in Him.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.440]   Again, we got to anchor this down. It's very tempting not to say these
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.000]   things. We're ashamed of this concept, I think. That it sounds not
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.800]   palatable to an unbeliever, but we're unashamed of saying this. He created you.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.400]   You belong to Him. Everything in this world belongs to Him. The second
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.680]   ramification is that He has full authority of His creation. So if
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:44.120]   everything belongs to Him, then He has full authority. I didn't type out Romans
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.240]   9, 18 through 24, but do you all know this passage? This is a very difficult
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.440]   passage. The clay, yeah right, right. Will the clay say to His
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.040]   maker, "What are you gonna do? Will the pot say anything to the one
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.680]   who made the pot?" No. He has full authority over you. He's like, "Don't make me this way."
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.800]   You can't say that. It was in His volition to do that. You could get
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.120]   mad or whatever, but it was totally in His volition to do that. Letter C, He
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:28.000]   cares about His own creation. This is an actual ramification of God being creator.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   Someone who creates cares about creation. Letter D, His creation then, and these go
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.440]   together, that's why the verses are down below in D, His creation carries His
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:49.680]   imprint. His creation carries His imprint. Psalm 19, 1. Oh, Alyssa?
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:13:01.640]   So everything that's made in creation, it will show what the Creator is
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:07.080]   like, what the Creator thinks is beautiful, what the Creator thinks is
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.040]   good versus not good. He won't create something He doesn't like, right? So in
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.640]   creation itself, there's an imprint of something about Him. And the pinnacle of
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.160]   that we know from Genesis 1 is that it's us, it's humanity. Humanity is created in
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:27.400]   the image of God. Romans 1, 18 through 23, we see that, that it's wired,
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.160]   whether you're a believer or not, it's wired in you that there is a Creator God,
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.120]   and that we are simply suppressing that truth that God is actually our Creator.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:46.600]   And in letter E, we have dignity. We have dignity. The biblical illustration, the
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.400]   great biblical illustration of this is that He is the potter and we are the
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.480]   clay. Since He molds the clay with intention, we know that He is a creative
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.000]   God. Since He is the potter, He can make whatever shape He desires. Since He is
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.520]   the potter, He's the one who has invested the time and the energy. Since He is the
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:08.200]   potter, the clay bears the imprint of the Maker. You can see how this is very
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.800]   helpful in talking to an unbeliever. If He is Creator, and if they admit to it,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.440]   which many people do, you're gonna go out and you're gonna ask, "Do you believe
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.200]   that something created?" Many people walking out there say, "Yes." And who does
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.000]   your life belong to? They'll say, "Me." I try to live a good life though, you know.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.800]   I say, "No, no, no. The ramifications of there being a Creator God is not
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.640]   for someone to go and live on his own accord." Now you have to kind of
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.440]   vet that out a little bit and see where that flows. Okay, here's some useful
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:49.680]   questions. And this is helpful in bridging to Him as Creator. Letter A, "Is
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:56.440]   this the way the world should be?" Try asking that question. Why? Because
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.520]   how they answer that question is going to show what they think about the
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.160]   Creator or lack thereof. Is this the world, is this the way the world
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.960]   should be? In two weeks we're gonna be doing some role play. So you guys are
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.720]   gonna be again taking on a different religious person or background and then
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.760]   someone is gonna be a believer and you guys are gonna switch. These are some
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.280]   questions you could ask though. As you're having this fake conversation, you know,
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.400]   I'm gonna actually have you write out like a background of who you think
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.880]   you are. So for the non-believer you can say like, "I converted at this
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.880]   age," and stuff like that. And you're gonna really try to take on that role. So as
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.040]   you're talking you can ask that, "Is this the way the world should be?"
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   And try to kind of go into that. "What do you think your purpose is in
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.640]   life?" Think about how people might answer that question when you ask that. "What do
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:58.800]   you think your purpose is in life?" What they say is going to prove or show or
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.280]   reveal or manifest what they think of the Creator. "What do you think about
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:10.880]   tree huggers?" There's a random one. The reason why I'm putting all these random
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.320]   ones is because I'm trying to show you examples of different ways you could go
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.920]   about this. You're gonna come across someone who's like an environmental
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.840]   fiend. You know, they're all about the environment. And so you go, "What do you
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.020]   think about tree huggers?" And they're gonna be like, "Oh great, you know, we got
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.600]   to protect the environment." "Well why do we have to protect the environment?" "Oh
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.520]   because we have..." And you keep going down this line. It's like, "Is there any real
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.080]   reason other than the fact that you know that God created the world and He
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.000]   created it good?" Letter D, "What kind of God is He?" If someone believes that there
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.500]   is a God, you can ask this question. Here's some sins against this truth. So
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.880]   this is what you should be looking for. When you come across this idea of
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   Creator and trying to help them see this concept of Creator, there are gonna be
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.960]   people who just straight-up deny His existence. This is their
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:10.860]   rebellion. This is their sin. Just be aware of that. If they're not denying His
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.240]   existence, they might also be suppressing His existence. Or it could
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   kind of go hand-in-hand there too. You suppress His existence.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   [Audience member] What's the difference between those? I've seen A like crazy. I haven't really seen B like crazy.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.040]   Yeah, I think they really do go hand-in-hand. You know, if you're
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.480]   denying, you are definitely suppressing. But I have seen people who like just
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.960]   straight-up feel like it's just suppressing. So we go onto the
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.280]   campus every week. There are just lots of different types of people on the
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.240]   college campuses. And they're all willing to talk. And they'll say something and
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.160]   then the next sentence they're saying something that completely contradicts
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.880]   what they said. And I say, "Hey, you're suppressing something here.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.000]   This is what you actually believe. You said it. It came out.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.520]   And then you said this. That's suppression." So they won't, a lot of
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.160]   them will be like, "I'm not denying His existence. I don't know." I say, "Oh, you're
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.640]   definitely suppressing something here. You know. You know. You said this."
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:23.240]   So does that... Right, right. So people like to wiggle around and be like, "I don't
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:31.320]   know." Bible says, "They know. They know. They're suppressing." So, okay. Any other
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.000]   questions on God as Creator?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Oh, actually I do have a question. What if someone were to ask why did He create all things?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.760]   Because the answer that I gave to this person was that you can't say that, like, why a person creates.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.200]   It's just something is like their nature and character. We don't attribute something to...
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:02.760]   We don't say a person is Creator and then therefore He creates. We say He creates, therefore He is a Creator.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.400]   So what would be, like, an alternative response to that?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.360]   Why did God create all things? Maybe we could... Anyone want to respond to that?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.960]   I'm not saying you have the right answer or...
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:24.600]   I'm just saying from a social point of view, we are created to glorify God. That is why He created us.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.160]   As for why He created everything, I don't know. Why He saved us, I really don't know.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   [laughter]
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:40.600]   It's nice to have the choir here, you know. So, yeah. He created us ultimately for His glory.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.400]   And there's a lot that goes along with that, though. You know, we have the right
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:52.600]   answers, but to be able to engage with someone, you know, it's a lot more complex than that, right?
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:59.080]   We know God is holy and wrathful and just, but we know that there's a lot more to that
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.840]   than someone who's a judge with a gavel. So we can't have this one-dimensional view of God
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:11.720]   and just say, like, God is for God's glory. That is absolutely true. And then we work with that fact,
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:19.640]   right? Which you would do, like, as you keep talking. Another facet of it is He wanted to.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:29.160]   You know, like, you don't ask an artist, like, why'd you do that? It was His joy to. It was His desire to.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:36.680]   Why are you asking this question, you know? So there's a lot that we as creation accuse God of
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   without realizing because we're made in His imprint, we actually know the answers to it.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:47.720]   Like, if we were to ask, like, they're not fair questions, you know? So even the age-old question of,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:55.880]   like, how could a loving God, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? Even that question, it's wired into us.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.840]   But because we're, like, so, like, self-centered, the accusations that we throw against God, like, it's,
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.960]   like, we could quickly make people see that it doesn't make any sense, you know? Like, for example,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:14.760]   like, if you just use a simple image of, I talked about this with some of the college students, but
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:21.960]   I saw a video this past Tuesday of, like, cockroach eggs, and they were hatching. It was really nasty.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.800]   There's, like, thousands of little cockroach eggs in a little pack. But if you imagine, like, a
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:35.320]   cockroach egg nest, like, embedded into your wall, everybody in this room is going to say, "Destroy
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:42.920]   the house," you know? Like, "Just get rid of everything. It is so nasty, so vile, so ugly."
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.040]   You can hear it kind of skittering around. It was so gross. There is no one that's going to
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:57.240]   approach the other direction and say, "Oh, well, you're going to kill them? You know, like, give them a chance,"
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.280]   you know? There's no one that's going to do that. And so there's this, like, view that we come from
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:08.440]   where, because of our sin and because of, like, our desire to preserve ourselves, we throw accusations
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.360]   up at God. That's what happened as soon as sin entered into the world. Blame shift, blame shift,
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:19.000]   blame shift. And so we're trying to help people see that, you know, when you come from a God-centered
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.960]   worldview, the man-centered worldview just crumbles. In Psalm 2, it says, "God looks down at man, and
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.000]   he laughs, he scoffs in derision," like, these people who try to just do their own thing, you know?
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.520]   It's not the truth.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:43.960]   Huh? Oh, the cockroaches? I'm not looking that up again. Oh, so gross. Okay.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:51.400]   God is holy. God is holy. 1 Samuel 2.2. I forgot who was next.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.480]   Okay.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.600]   Okay.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:07.640]   Okay. Habakkuk.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:19.800]   Okay. And the 1 Peter?
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:33.000]   Okay. Another concept we understand, man, how difficult is it to communicate a holy God to an
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:40.600]   unbeliever? That is so hard to do. And yet, you can't convince someone of their sin unless they
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.960]   see that. So you can get a lot of people to see that they're flawed, and you can see a lot of
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   people to even see that they're broken. You can't get many people to see that they're sinful before
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:24:00.760]   a holy God. But this is our anchoring thought. We can't get to next week's lesson until we go
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:07.000]   through this one, that God is holy. We can get someone to say, like, "Hey, are you a liar?"
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.360]   We've seen that done before, right? That presentation. Do you lie? Oh, then you're a liar.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.920]   Do you covet? Then you... What's covet?
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:25.640]   Covetor? You get the picture. Like, so if you do these things, then you are. And someone might say,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:33.800]   like, "Oh, yeah, I am." But until the holiness of God is seen, what are you trying to convince them
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:41.400]   of? How can you convince them of their need for Jesus? There's no need to even get to those points
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.920]   until they are able to see this. This is the truth. But here are some of the ramifications,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.120]   and then we'll kind of circle back to it. Letter A, God determines the standard of right and wrong.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:58.920]   If God is indeed holy, then what someone thinks right or wrong is does not end up mattering. He
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:05.400]   dictates it. He says it, and that's how it is. Like someone who creates a board game,
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.880]   they make the rules. No one can come by and start questioning you and be like, "Why? Why would you
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.800]   do that?" He made the board game. That's how it is. Letter B, the holy God requires perfect
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.000]   obedience to his law. The holy God requires perfect obedience to his law.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.840]   Let's read some of these. Matthew 5.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:36.120]   Okay, and James.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.880]   All right, and then Psalm 34.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:57.400]   All right. So if God is indeed holy, then there are these ramifications that come out that we
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:10.200]   must adhere to the holy law. Now, God being holy, it can be displayed. There is this idea,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:19.080]   when we think of just even the justice system, we have an inherent understanding of adhering to
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:29.640]   a good law. And so when you try to display God's holiness, you can talk about it with someone
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.560]   with images that they will be able to understand. But I want to kind of come back to this.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.080]   Don't stray too far from the authority of scripture.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:49.800]   Even just the ability to say, "Hey, this is God's word, and it tells us who God is,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:56.200]   that he is holy, and that one day when you die, you will come across a holy God
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:02.760]   who is going to judge right and wrong." That thing, more often than not, if you guys have
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.240]   gone evangelizing pretty frequently, more often than not, actually a lot of people believe it.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.040]   They don't buck against that too much. And I was very surprised by that the more I saw that.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:17.080]   Why don't people buck against this idea of the fact that they're going to be judged one day?
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:23.000]   It's very strange. It's embedded in many, many religions that we're going to be judged on some
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.200]   kind of standard. And so to get people to believe that God is holy just by saying, "Hey, it says
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.000]   here in God's word that God is holy," people don't fight against that as much as I thought they
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.360]   would. They fight against lots of other things, but I don't think there's a reason to try to
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:45.640]   go too far with this. That's how it is. God is holy. So you can go into the morality, into the
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.040]   ethics, like why is there right and wrong? You should, and you should talk about those things.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.200]   We'll talk about some of those things in the methodologies portion in section six,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.000]   and talk about why do you think it's wrong for someone to, "Is it okay for me to come up to you
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.680]   and slap you in the face?" Would that be right or wrong? Wrong. Well, you have morality. It's good
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.640]   to talk about all this, but sometimes you can get lost in that. It's like, man, God is a holy God.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.080]   Okay. Then letter C, and this is why the law of God is revealed in conscience.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.480]   Romans 2, 14 through 15.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.960]   So when Gentiles who do not have the law by nature do the things in the law, these,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.800]   although not having the law, are a law to themselves, who show the work of the law
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.880]   written in their hearts, their conscience also being a witness, and between themselves,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.640]   their thoughts, if using or else if using them. Okay.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.480]   Or excusing them. Thank you.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:49.560]   Yeah. So it's all in there. He describes even the Gentiles. They don't have the law, but by
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:55.480]   nature do the things in the law. Remember the law being given to the Israelites was given as God's
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.200]   grace to give a very clear path, but the law was actually written on the hearts of people.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:09.560]   It's there. And so again, it's not difficult to get people to believe in the fact that God is holy.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.120]   Here's some useful questions to address this. How do you deal with guilt?
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:19.880]   Oh man, I've gotten some fascinating answers to this one. How do you deal with guilt?
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:29.240]   There is no human being that can actually live with guilt. You can't. You have to do something
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:36.280]   with it, whether you bury it or try to justify it or whatever. When you talk about guilt,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.400]   they'll just start talking about the fact that they actually do believe
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:48.920]   that they are under some kind of judgment and scrutiny. It's immediate. And when you start
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:55.640]   talking, you should talk about things as if people have an understanding of created order.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:02.120]   That they have these things that God is holy and that we are going to be judged by him. We can talk
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   to them as if they have an understanding of it. And when you do, when you try to go around and
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.160]   convince them of something that you think they might not be convinced of, sometimes you do a
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:20.200]   disservice to it. Don't be afraid. Don't be so scared that you're going to jump too far ahead
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:26.760]   of them. They know a lot more inherently than we give them credit for just by being humanity.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:34.200]   Did that make sense? I don't know if that was clear. Okay. Let it be. Who determines the right
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:39.720]   and wrong for you? Or even in our society? I'm sure all of you have used this one before.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.240]   Who determines right or wrong? What do you think God requires from us?
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:50.280]   Just imagine the answers that come to this one. What do you think God wants from us?
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.720]   We get a lot of like, "Oh, he wants us to be good people."
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   Well, if God is holy, there's a lot more to it than that. Let it be. On what basis does
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.840]   God determine who goes to heaven and who goes to hell? And why? Why do you believe that?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:12.200]   Yeah, we're going to talk about open-ended questions at the end of this.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.920]   All right. Sins against this truth. People will try to deny an objective standard.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:25.160]   So don't let people get away with this one. If your standard is not my standard, then
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.760]   at what point does our standards align? I can slap you in the face then, right? Because
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.840]   it's not against my standard. Suppression of guilt, that's similar to the other one.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:42.600]   So if you corner people and saying, you corner people into a place where it's like, "Oh,
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.640]   it's got to be some kind of objectivity here." Like your standard can't, like the fact that I'm
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.680]   so staunch on mine, you're going to get cornered at a certain point and then they're going to start
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.960]   trying to suppress the guilt portion of it. Involvement in false religions. False religions
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:11.080]   have come up because of this. And then sin upon sin. People will, on top of their sin, begin to
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:19.240]   sin more and more and more because in the face of God's holiness, there needs to be zero sin.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:25.400]   So when you're encountering one sin, you either confess and repent of that sin or you have to
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.400]   sin more to be able to suppress that sin. And that's what you'll find people doing in light
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:36.760]   of a holy God. So all of this, it feels very theoretical right now, but we're going to be
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.960]   reviewing these things as we go out. And once we, when we're going out, as you're talking,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.800]   if you start, if you keep these things in mind somewhere in your brain, it's going to,
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.280]   you're going to, it's going to start making sense. You're going to be like, "Oh, I see what you're
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.880]   doing here." You know, like this stuff is just, it's out of, largely out of a book called
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:33:02.200]   The Metzger Book. Did I tell the truth? Is that what it was? I thought it was like a TV show and
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:08.040]   I got confused for a second. Yeah. So, so a lot of it comes out of these people who have gone
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:16.200]   evangelizing a lot and they've used all their study to kind of confirm many things. And the
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   things that I pulled out of the book are the things that I've gone out and done a lot of.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.400]   And I'm like, man, these are the things, these are the main things I kind of see a ton. Okay.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:34.520]   Any questions up to this point? All right. The, The Chantry Book, the Today's Gospel is a great
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.280]   resource by the way. Very small, thin book, pretty cheap on Amazon, I think. But he says here,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.680]   "Preaching on the attributes of God is essential to the conversion of a man. Without a knowledge
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.920]   of God, a sinner does not know whom he has offended, who threatens him with destruction,
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.040]   or who is able to save him. Apart from some clear apprehensions of God, there can be no personal
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.560]   approach to God, and personal savior becomes a hollow phrase." So again, if you don't anchor on
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.960]   this idea of God being creator, God being holy, then everything else we're going to talk about
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:10.120]   will fall apart. So given all this, what is the starting point and what is the common ground?
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:17.000]   I do believe the general revelation is a very good place to begin. Probably the place to begin.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:26.840]   Sometimes when I'm looking at someone, this is the thought I have, and just running through my brain,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:32.280]   you know that God is, you know that God is God the creator.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:40.360]   Like, and talk to them like they, like they know. If you're constantly trying to convince them that
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:46.600]   God exists, you know, it just goes down a rabbit trail. And when you just, when you anchor this
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.960]   down, you'll hear them say something, some certain things, and you'll hear it in those
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:59.400]   comments that they're using. Like what you just said just proves that you believe in a God.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.640]   It comes out so much. But if you don't have that anchoring thought in, you're going to spend a lot
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.200]   of time trying to convince it, and you're going to miss the idea and the thought that like, man,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.040]   what he just said proved it, but he got away with that statement. And you're still trying to make
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.000]   him believe that there's a God. Yes? Is it still like an appropriate starting point when you're
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.760]   talking about like a staunch atheist? Yeah, I mean, with an atheist, it's, it's pretty easy. I mean,
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.720]   we've all used this, I'm guessing the same strategy. Where does anything come from, right?
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:40.680]   That's like the first line. And they're going to go and go and go. But at a certain point,
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.320]   they're going to say, I don't know. They have to. That's the end for the atheist. I don't know.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:51.080]   But it's a, it's a higher philosophy, or like, it's a, it's a more sophisticated philosophy
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.000]   for them, right? Like I'm more sophisticated because I'm able to say, I don't know.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:05.480]   Right. Which is faith. And so I still think it's a starting point. I say like, I believe
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.320]   something too. Like I have faith too. And I believe that God created everything.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:17.960]   I would say that to an atheist. I believe that God created everything. And pull him into the
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:28.520]   biblical worldview rather than play in his playground. Because he knows. So don't play
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:34.920]   their game. Don't go into their world and, and be like, well, I'm going to try to convince you of
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:41.880]   the fact like what you just said, like you don't know, proves that, like, first of all, at the very
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:49.240]   least that there is place or space that perhaps God exists, right? And they're going to say,
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:55.400]   well, I guess, you know, like, and so you go from there and you get to the point where you say,
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.800]   well, God created all things. So I would say that next, even if they're not fully here,
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.160]   them taking that step into the biblical worldview, maybe he does as an atheist for him to say that,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:12.840]   I would say, well, God is the creator. He exists. Everything we see around us has been created by
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.960]   God, you know, and we do that unapologetically. We say it with a smile on our face and we say
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:24.040]   it very nicely. But we say, basically, what we're saying is you're wrong. Not because we have all
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:30.840]   the truth, like, like perfectly like wrapped up and stuff like that. But by the confidence that
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:39.960]   we have in our word. So, okay, I keep moving here. So you know that God is, God the creator,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.440]   but you also have the moral law that God is the Holy One. That's your conscience. You know
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:54.360]   that there is right and wrong. What is guilt? You have these things that points to some kind
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:02.600]   of creator that is actually, at the very least, good or better or the word we use is holy.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:11.320]   Launching the conversation, start with a common conversation. So don't like go and like,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.560]   like say, hey, so what kind of background do you come from? And they're like talking about the fact
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.840]   that they're Buddhist. And then you just go like, well, God is creator and he's holy, you know,
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.640]   don't do that. But like, start with common conversation. What you're trying to do again,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.920]   like this isn't, this isn't like a step by step thing that we're going through. We're saying,
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.840]   tack these things down in your heart, in your in your mind, so that you can at any point when
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.000]   you're spinning it around in a conversation, these things are you're so intimately aware with the
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.760]   gospel. We understand that, right? The four points are the gospel. We're so intimately aware with it
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.560]   that when he says something like something pops up, and that becomes the grabbing point, like,
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.640]   oh, he like this is where I can say that God is creator. This is where I can bring up the point
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.880]   that God is holy. But start with a common conversation. Listen very carefully, please,
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.440]   please, please do not, we're going to go out hopefully together. But as we go and do this,
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:16.200]   do not be formulating just your own answer. Actually hear what they're saying. Try to
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.840]   almost like try to step into their shoes. And why are they saying what they're saying?
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.800]   Why are they thinking the way they're thinking? Why did he get defensive when I said this?
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.120]   Yeah, you're, you're trying to understand the person. So listen carefully and wait patiently
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:36.680]   for the answers. Our goal is not to, you know, be like in your face kind of thing. You know,
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:43.960]   our goal is not to beat them in some kind of debate. Our goal is to care, to love, and ultimately
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.240]   to restore God's glory in this person's life because God's glory is that important to us.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:55.000]   So we patiently a lot of times I think we are after our own glory, because this is what we
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.920]   believe. And so our egos are involved in it. And so as we're talking with people,
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:05.960]   we're not talking on behalf of God anymore. We're talking on behalf of our Christianity. And that's
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:13.880]   very, very bad. You know, it's you lose the love and you lost it. So ask good questions.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:25.080]   So we don't have to be preaching at them. We're trying to circulate something here. So ask lots
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:32.760]   of good questions. I gave you just some in this packet or in this section. The useful questions
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.360]   in both the God is Creator and God is Holy sections. So those are some starting points,
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.520]   but you can tell that those are just one out of thousands of questions that you can ask
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.120]   based on these things. Ask permission to ask direct questions. This has been super helpful for me.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:53.800]   This was another one of those surprising things. Where are we here?
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:04.600]   Oh, actually, let's backtrack. So sometimes you have to ask yes or no questions. Have you ever
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.160]   wondered why we're here? Is this the way the world should be? Do you think that God is involved in
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:17.720]   our world today? So what the yes or no questions do is it makes them, you and them, you affirm
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:23.000]   them that we are on some kind of common ground here. Okay, so for example, do you think that
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.120]   God is involved in our world today? If they say yes, there are going to be statements that they
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:34.760]   make after that will disprove what they said. So you say, but you said yes, we agree to the fact
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:40.280]   that God is indeed involved or something like that. So yes or no questions do have its place.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:48.440]   However, open-ended questions are better. The how, what, why, you can ask, oh, can you explain
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:56.120]   that a little bit further? Those are good. Make them talk and make sure that they're not talking
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:06.600]   you know, like nonsensically. So if you don't get it, don't just assume that, assume it,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:12.280]   you know, because they're a Hindu guy or whatever. So here's some of those questions that can help.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:18.760]   How did you make that decision? What motivated you to choose this job? Why is that so important
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.280]   to you? Who determines if something is right or wrong? What do you think God requires of us to
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.120]   go to heaven? How does someone in your religion get to heaven? Have them explain. You're trying
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   to get them to explain their worldview so that you can understand them better. All right, now we get
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:35.960]   to ask permission to ask direct questions. We have here, can I ask you a personal question, Mike?
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.520]   How do you deal with guilt or shame? How do I know if God approves of me or not?
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.000]   So when they're difficult questions, when you feel like, oh, they're getting defensive
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.760]   and they look uncomfortable, you could ask them for permission and it really helps
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:57.160]   because it makes it feel like they're kind of in control again. They're not like backing up,
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.960]   but they're like, I gave this guy permission. So now I'm the one kind of moving back forward
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:08.760]   and there you can kind of re-engage. So ask permission to ask direct questions. Can I ask you
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.440]   kind of a difficult question? I'm not trying to be offensive, but do you mind if I ask it?
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:22.280]   Do you think you're a sinner? So if you just said, if you said like, hey, do you think you're a
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:28.680]   sinner? They might be like, what? But the responses you'll get will be very defensive in nature.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.960]   But if you ask them, they're going to be like, oh yeah, you know, I think, yeah,
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.920]   it gets a little more cordial. Though that's not our, that's not our goal. It's helpful.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.960]   Letter E, listen again and then apply the Christian worldview.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.800]   Okay. So you're, you're starting with a common conversation. You're listening and waiting for
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.760]   answers. You're clarifying things. You're asking good questions. You're asking permission to ask,
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.600]   ask questions. You're listening again. And as you're doing all this, you're, what you're
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.160]   gathering is their worldview. And then what you're doing is you pull them into the Christian worldview.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:12.120]   So just the last thought, we sometimes think like if it's me and Marsha,
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.920]   we sometimes think that they're there, I'm here and here's the truth. Okay. And so we're trying
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:25.480]   to get to the truth, but what, how it really is, the actual picture is she's there. I'm standing
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.800]   on truth. So you're pulling her here. So that, keep that, keep that there. Like the anchoring
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.760]   is on God and who he is. Pull, pull them into that. All the other stuff, like it'll start to
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:44.440]   fall in place the next few weeks as we go into man, as we go into Jesus, as we go into what is
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.840]   conversion, how, how do, how are they called to respond and apprehend the first three points
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.640]   for it to become a saving gospel to them? Okay. Any final questions?
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:45:03.320]   Okay. Um, the homework,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.440]   all the homework is going to be written at the end of these.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:18.120]   So if it's not written there, it's not homework. Uh, homework should be,
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:24.600]   is it handling objections? Is it that one? Okay. So handling objections. So this is a resource,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.280]   read through it. There are a lot of questions that you're going to want to ask here that,
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   uh, we're not going to get to because we're trying to get to the fundamentals of the gospel.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:37.960]   And so the handling objections portion might be helpful. Um, as a person who takes this class,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.560]   if you want to write up a little snippet to add to this packet, you can send me something.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.520]   There's like this objection that someone came up with and you're like, wow, that was a good
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.840]   objection. Answer that objection, send it to me. I'll include it in the packet if it's, if it's
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.760]   good. If it's bad, I won't. Um, if it's good, I'll add it so that the future classes will have more.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:05.160]   Okay. So you can help, uh, Burian like that. And then, uh, we are going to be also reading,
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.920]   which, which two religions are going into? Mormonism and Jehovah's Witnesses,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.240]   the people who come to your door, right? So we'll hit those. And then, um,
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:22.760]   and then the memory versus for God. Hmm. Oh, it's in, it's in your resources section.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.480]   So I think it's your, your last resource right here.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   There's four of them. So it's fair game for quiz. Just saying. Okay.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.440]   Does everyone, did everyone see it? The memory versus are back here. So you're not going into
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:48.840]   the packet or the lesson itself to get it. It's right, right here. Okay. Actually,
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:56.520]   we have time for no more questions. I got to run. So, um, Oh, I have it right here. Okay.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:04.920]   Everyone knows what to do, right? Okay.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:14.360]   Just to be aware, um, in the calendar, uh, again, uh, we'll talk about it some more next week, but
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.960]   why is nothing in my folder? In your calendar shows you the two things I'm asking you to try
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.720]   to participate in, which is the, um, gospel, no, the evangelism time that we're going to be doing
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:32.120]   in March. And then in April, there's a gospel night. Okay. So I'm going to be asking you to,
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.360]   uh, like listen, listen for the announcements today during Sunday service and, uh, be engaged
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.840]   with that because as a class, unless you have prior engagements, totally fine. You didn't know
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:46.760]   before we had the class, so that's okay. Um, but if you have that slot free, um, try to think of
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:54.280]   it as mandatory. Um, yeah, that way, uh, we'll go and we'll share the gospel together. And, uh,
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.680]   it's two, I think very good ways to do it. It's the cold evangelism. And then it's the,
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.640]   bring a friend to church type of evangelism. And then the middle two weeks, we're going to be,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.440]   um, I'm actually going to be asking you guys to write down the name of somebody that you know,
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.320]   that you regularly are maybe interacting with, um, and to actually share the gospel with them.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.880]   Okay. So that one is a little scarier, I think, than cold evangelism because there's some skin
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:23.800]   in the game there. So, okay. Are we good? Any questions? No questions? Okay. Let's pray.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:32.840]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your help to evangelize a gospel that truly is centered around
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:39.000]   you, uh, that we might not waver as people who believe in a high view of God and a high view of
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.480]   your word, uh, that we might not waver in, uh, deadening and diluting and, and making, uh,
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:51.000]   boiling things down to, to, uh, something so simplistic that it is no longer the gospel.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.840]   Father, we know that the enemy loves it when we preach an incomplete gospel. Um, God, it is not
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:03.560]   a gospel that is effective to save. And so God, I pray that this would be truly our anchoring thought.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:11.880]   You are a holy God. You have created us. Father, everything else falls under that. And so Lord,
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:18.040]   teach us, teach us to fear you then that these are not things we're not just preaching. God is holy.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.560]   God is creator to others, but we believe it deeply. And so we tremble and fear you. We tremble
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:28.680]   before you and we fear you. And so God, when there's, when we're sitting across from someone
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:36.040]   sharing the gospel, we no longer fear them. And so Lord help us to be people who are able in that
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.520]   place, not to love ourselves, but to love the person we're looking at. And most of all, to love
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   you that we would draw them to the one we love in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
