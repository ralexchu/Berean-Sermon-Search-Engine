[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   All right, we're in Leviticus chapter 25.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.020]   So we actually only have a few more chapters to go.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.320]   And I know our Bible study is not, at least this session is not ending in three weeks.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.720]   We have about six weeks left.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.480]   So the last three weeks after we finished the book of Leviticus, we're going to be covering
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560]   something else until we get into our break in the winter.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.320]   So even though we only have three more weeks of Bible study in Leviticus, and then we have
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.000]   a review, we will continue our Bible study until the end of the session.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.680]   Just to kind of give you a heads up.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920]   Next week is Reformation night.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.560]   And so Wednesday, we don't have our typical Bible study.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.440]   We do have praise and prayer on Tuesday, right?
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.440]   Oh, Friday.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   Did I say Tuesday?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   All right.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.000]   So Friday, we have praise and prayer.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   It is next week, right?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.400]   Yeah, so next week.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.120]   So next Friday, instead of Wednesday Bible study, we have Friday praise and prayer, just
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.760]   to kind of keep your mind on that.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.320]   All right.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.200]   Today, the Bible study is on the sabbatical year and the year of Jubilee, which is a very
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.560]   important concept in the Old Testament.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.720]   And you will find, I'm not going to mention all of it, but you'll find quite a bit of
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040]   the language and the principles that are taught in the New Testament, what is going on here
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.040]   in chapter 25.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.480]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:33.800]   Heavenly Father, I want to pray for my brothers and sisters as they are coming from a long
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.920]   day at work, from school.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.360]   And though they may be physically tired, we pray, Father, that your word would renew us,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.520]   help us to understand not only the words, but your very heart, that we may draw closer
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.840]   to you.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.600]   We know, Father God, that what you teach us in this chapter is really who you are.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   And so help us, Lord God, to know you better and that we would respond in a manner that
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.920]   is reasonable.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.280]   And so we thank you and just ask, Lord God, that you would soften our hearts and open
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   our ears.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   Amen.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   All right.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   So let me just give you a broad overview.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.080]   In chapter 25, 26, and 27 is conclusion of what's happening in the book of Leviticus.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.640]   And then we talked about how in the chiastic system we started out by how to behave or
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.340]   what to bring to God in order to connect with him, right?
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.880]   And that's the first five chapters talks about the five major sacrifices and how they are
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.300]   necessary in order to draw near to God.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.720]   We conclude the book of Leviticus in the last three chapters in how to behave in the land
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.200]   that God is going to present to them, right?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   So the first section of the chiastic system in the book of Leviticus is how to draw near
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   to God.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   The end part of it, chapter 25, 26, 27, is that God is going to now lead them into the
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.220]   promised land and when they get there, how they are to behave.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.120]   So God is giving instructions, warnings, encouragements that this is how, these are the principles
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   and these are the laws that they are to live by when they get into the land.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.180]   So chapter 25 is talking about the year of Jubilee and the Sabbath that is necessary.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.720]   Chapter 26 is talking about the blessings and curses that you ought to follow in order
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.560]   to live a long and prosperous life in the land.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.360]   And then the very last chapter, chapter 27, it goes into, again, we'll get more into it,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.400]   but about valuation.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.060]   How do you, when you make vows, how do you determine what the vows cost?
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.240]   And so all of these things may be tedious, but these are all instructions that God gave
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.320]   Israel on how they ought to behave in the promised land.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:59.040]   So the first part of it, maybe you can take that pin out and then put it back in.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:26.880]   You took it out and put it back in.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.440]   Nope.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.120]   Not working.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.920]   There you go.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   All right.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920]   Okay.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.040]   So chapter 25 through 27, our instruction is given to Israel on how they must live when
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.720]   they finally occupy the promised land, which I already mentioned to you.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.080]   Occupy the promised land.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   So remember that because I'm going to move.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.720]   Okay.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:30.080]   Did you do that or you did that?
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080]   Right.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   Okay.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080]   All right.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.720]   So chapter 25 deals with keeping the Sabbath, right?
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.800]   Verses one through seven talking about the Sabbath year, so every seventh year.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.560]   And then it talks about starting from chapter, verse eight through 55, super Sabbath, right?
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.320]   Which happens every 50th year, which we call the year of Jubilee.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   And it was primarily to keep the covenant relationship with God, covenant symbol between
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.200]   God and them.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.800]   So everything that God has taught the nation of Israel in the book of Leviticus sets them
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.640]   apart from every other nation.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.240]   But this particular law of the Sabbath year was unlike any other nation, right?
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.020]   And we're going to get into that.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.480]   It really distinguished them from every other country, every other nation, even to this
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   day, right?
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.440]   And we'll get deep into that.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.920]   The laws of the year of Jubilee provided clearance or cancellation of debt.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.720]   So if you read chapter 25, you would have already known that verse eight through 55
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.960]   basically talks about basically a clean state, clean slate, and financially to start over
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   every 50th year, okay?
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.640]   And that's what the year of Jubilee was.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.360]   And then, are you doing this?
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.600]   Oh, you're doing it, okay.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   The year of Jubilee meant that about once a generation, all Israelites had the opportunity
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.040]   of a fresh start on their own land, right?
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.520]   And this happened every 50th year.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.000]   And again, we're going to get into details of that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.640]   This was intended to prevent the creation of feudal system in which increasing numbers
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.600]   of poor served the small minority of rich land owners.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.760]   So no matter how bad your crops were, no matter how badly the situation got, every 50th year,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   basically God gave an opportunity for the Israelites to start over.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.740]   It doesn't mean that you could never become rich.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.280]   It just meant that whatever, that the minimum property that you had, God allowed that to
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.040]   all go back and start over.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.360]   And there's a good reason for that, right?
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.960]   So it doesn't mean that the rich people couldn't get rich, that this was communism and they
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.240]   owned nothing.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.880]   It was to make sure that there wasn't this generational debt that got piled on upon one
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.920]   family to another, and then by the time it got to about fifth, sixth generation, there
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.160]   was just no way to get out of it.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:59.040]   So every generation, God allowed a reset, at least to have their property back, okay?
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.080]   All right.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.120]   So the laws of the Sabbath year, verses one through seven.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.840]   After taking possession of the promised land, they were to rest the land on the Sabbath
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.440]   year every seventh year.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.320]   So sixth year they're supposed to work, and then on seventh year they're supposed to let
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.080]   it be.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.720]   B, they're able to pick and eat whatever grew in the seventh year, but could not do any
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.560]   sowing or pruning or complete harvesting that year.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.640]   So every year they weren't to work.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.520]   It doesn't say what they were supposed to do with their time when they're not harvesting,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.480]   but every seventh year they were to leave the land alone.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.680]   None of us are farmers here.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.640]   Maybe some of you grew up on a farm, but I've read, again in before studies, that whether
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.960]   you're a Christian or a Jew or not, that it is understood that whenever you farm a land,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.760]   you're supposed to give it rest every few years in order for the land to recuperate.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.440]   And I remember when I was younger, in my twenties, there was this multi-level scheme thing that
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.680]   I was checking out, and basically they were selling minerals.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.600]   And I heard, I don't know how many hours of tapes about why the land isn't producing sweet
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.120]   fruits, and because we've over farmed the land.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.960]   And so most where the people are very heavily populated, you can still grow, you know, like
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.600]   all the other trees and different things, but the minerals are deficient.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.200]   And as a result of that, it doesn't have the same kind of nutrients that it would have
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.400]   had long time ago.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.520]   And that's part of the reason why people don't live long lives today.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.880]   That's true or not, but that was part of the presentation that they gave to sell these
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.560]   minerals, right?
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.680]   But one of the interesting things about that was how it's a known fact among the farmers
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.200]   that you had to give it rest.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.120]   And so it doesn't explain here that this is why the minerals need to be recuperated, or
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.120]   it doesn't say anything like that.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.720]   But God says, remember we talked about how when Adam and Eve fell, what fell with Adam
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.200]   and Eve?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   Huh?
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.480]   Creation, right?
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.660]   In the book of Romans, it says that the creation longs for the appearing of the sons of God.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.320]   And so the fall didn't just happen to human being, it also happened to creation.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.960]   That's why thorns and thistles, you're going to work all your life and what it's going
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.840]   to produce is thorns and thistle, right?
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:40.040]   So redemption, ultimately he's talking about redemption of mankind, but he also connects
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.960]   mankind with the redemption of the earth.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.240]   And so remember at the very end, we talked about the new heavens and new earth.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.320]   He's talking about the restoration of earth and this is heaven is going to be reestablished
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.600]   at Jerusalem as a center.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.560]   Okay, I'm not going to get into that now.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.200]   We studied that when we were studying through the book of Revelation.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.520]   Okay?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.320]   C, this Sabbath year also provided rest for the workers and the animals.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.500]   Not only for the owners, but it gave the workers time to rest.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.600]   In Proverbs chapter 12, verse 10, I don't have that up for you, but it basically says
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:22.120]   the righteous man is righteous even among, even toward his animals and servants.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   Right?
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.160]   So he says the farmer is to give rest for his animals.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:35.080]   D, it also served to remind Israel of the covenant relationship with the Lord.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.640]   If you notice as you're reading, it says over and over again, the reason why they ought
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.480]   to do this is because it is a Sabbath to the Lord.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Right?
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.880]   It says that in verse two, it says that in verse four, and then it doesn't say it in
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.600]   that exact language, but it says over and over again, this is to be done for the Lord.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.600]   Right?
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.200]   It was, it was beneficial for them, but ultimately it was a covenant symbol of a relationship
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.440]   with their covenant God.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.080]   Right?
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:09.280]   So again, before we go on, remember, remember the concept of Sabbath?
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.880]   God creates the earth in six days.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.400]   On the seventh day, he did what?
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   He rested.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   Right?
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.040]   He went into Sabbath.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.320]   When Adam and Eve sinned, what happens?
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.120]   That rest is broken.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120]   Sabbath is broken.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.460]   They are no longer with the Lord because the Lord is in the Sabbath.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.980]   And so mankind is outside the Sabbath.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.800]   So the idea of Sabbath isn't just making sure that you keep it holy, that you don't farm
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   your land.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.320]   And, and then remember when Jesus shows up and then the Pharisees come, how come you
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.000]   guys are doing this and that on the Sabbath?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.880]   And then Jesus turns around and rebukes them.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   What does he say?
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.200]   That Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.920]   It wasn't meant for you to do, do more work.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   Right?
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.560]   And he said, and then ultimately who's the Lord of the Sabbath?
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   Right?
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560]   God.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   God is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.280]   In other words, their whole idea of Sabbath was worked.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.660]   The whole point of the Sabbath was to bring them back into a restored relationship with,
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.080]   with God.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.440]   So the restoration of Sabbath here, every seventh year, it was to be not only for them
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.880]   to rest, but it was, it was meant to be a dedication to them.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.040]   Right?
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.920]   To take time to rest instead of working.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.600]   And then to, to, you know, what would you do if you had a whole year of not working?
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   Right?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.560]   Traveling, surfing, internet.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   We don't know.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   They didn't have any of that stuff.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560]   Right?
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.440]   It wasn't meant for you to, okay, don't work.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.480]   And so co-travel and, and then go down the bucket list and things that you haven't done,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.720]   just go and get that done.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   Right?
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.320]   The Sabbath was meant to be a time of resting to, again, to remember the covenant relationship
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.960]   with, with the Father.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   Right?
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.480]   That, that's the whole concept of the Sabbath.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.980]   E, not planting or harvesting on the seventh year would have been a huge financial burden
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.980]   on the Israelites.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:05.340]   So remember, even though you, you know, God commanded you not to work, but imagine if
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.560]   every seventh year you had no income.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.960]   Right?
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.200]   The whole year there was no income.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   What would that do to you financially?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.800]   Right?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.880]   Humanly speaking, well, it's going to ruin us.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.920]   So part of the Sabbath year, seventh year rest was to acknowledge the Lordship of Christ,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.800]   Lordship of God in their land.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.240]   So they had to trust God.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.240]   Right?
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.320]   That God was going to be the one who provides.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.640]   But ultimately, the harvest doesn't, doesn't depend on them, but it depends on God.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.520]   So later on, we're going to look at verse 21, how God's going to make up for that.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   Right?
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.480]   So, you know, superficially, we may look at that, oh great, seventh year, we get to rest.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.720]   But if you're an actual farmer taking care of children, and people are dependent upon
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.760]   you, it's like, not work on the seventh?
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.840]   Right?
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   What does that mean?
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.520]   How can we possibly provide for our family?
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.440]   So again, this teaching of the Sabbath was a covenant symbol in relationship with God,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.480]   but it is also to remind them that He's Lord over their life.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   Okay?
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.000]   And we're going to get to that later on.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.400]   Verse 8 through 17, number four, the laws of the year of Jubilee.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   The year of Jubilee is to be observed every 50th year.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:32.560]   So 7 times 7, 49 years, and on the 50th year, the whole year was to be dedicated as a year
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.080]   of Jubilee.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.040]   B, the year of Jubilee started on the Day of Atonement.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:45.600]   Do you know what day the Day of Atonement, what month the Day of Atonement happened?
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   Seventh month.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   Okay?
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.080]   So the number seven is extremely important.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.960]   So on the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, the year of Jubilee would begin.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.360]   Now what's the significance of starting on the Day of Atonement?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.480]   Day of Atonement signified complete cleansing of Israel's sins.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   Right?
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.640]   Remember we talked about that, the Day of Atonement?
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.600]   I think it was chapter 16.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   Right?
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.160]   The Day of Atonement symbolized that even though they were giving sacrifices on a daily
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.320]   basis, that their sins would pile up.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   Right?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.080]   It's kind of like spring cleaning.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.120]   So God would allow that day to basically wipe out the sins of Israel and to start over.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.980]   So spiritually, on the Day of Atonement, they would have a clean slate because of the sacrifices.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:39.720]   So the year of Jubilee causes them to start fresh financially.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.080]   Right?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.200]   And also for the family.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:49.160]   So basically, the year of Jubilee was a complete restoration, spiritually and physically.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:56.160]   C. The year of Jubilee gave liberty to people, not only to land, but to people who were in
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.960]   debt that forced them to sell either their property or even themselves to pay it off.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.880]   It restored them back to their property and to their closest relatives.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.760]   Okay?
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:15.400]   We're going to go into a little bit more details about the significance of this law,
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.000]   but why do you think that this would have been?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.760]   So if you were somebody who were in debt, you would look at the year of Jubilee and
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   say, "Great!"
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   Right?
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.640]   "Every 50th year, I get a clean slate."
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.400]   No matter how bad your debt is, every 50th year, you get to start over.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Right?
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.680]   Do you think everybody would have been happy with this?
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.000]   No.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.320]   Yeah, only the poor people in debt would be happy with this.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.160]   The creditors would have been extremely angry with this.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.080]   Like, "Every 50th, how are we going to do business?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.880]   How am I going to ever give any loans?
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   How am I going to ever lease my land if I lease it out and then three years later it
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   gets wiped out?"
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   Right?
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.080]   What is the significance of this?
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.680]   I mean, it doesn't tell us in detail how it worked out, but you can imagine what kind
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   of problems that would have caused.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.800]   I mean, it sounds nice, right?
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.760]   Kind of like all the politicians saying all the free healthcare and, you know, get into
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.080]   politics a little bit.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.960]   Free healthcare and talking about free college and it's going to be 100% paid for and all
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.600]   the college students are saying, "Yes!"
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.240]   Well, where's that going to come from?
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   Who's going to pay for that?
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.880]   I don't care about the details.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   I just want free.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   Right?
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.760]   But you have to care about the details because it's going to come out of somebody's pocket.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.120]   So superficially it looks great, but in actual practice it may have caused a lot of problems.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.560]   But there's a good reason for all of this.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:58.960]   D, all leases were to end in the year of Jubilee.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.120]   All leases were to end in the year of Jubilee.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.280]   So their prices were calculated according to the number of years left for harvesting
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.720]   crops until the next Jubilee.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.040]   So in other words, if let's say you're on the 48th year, you would only lease it for
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   a year.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   Right?
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.400]   If you're on the 30th year, you would calculate how many years are left and based upon that
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.520]   you would price the lease.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.680]   Because on the 50th year, whatever was not would be wiped out.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   Right?
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.320]   And they would start over.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.520]   Okay?
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:38.040]   It sounds great, but humanly speaking it was probably very impractical.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:47.840]   But again, the point of all of this is God was ensuring, one, that the people who had
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.440]   inheritance when they went into the Promised Land, so whatever piece of land that you had,
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.960]   that God made sure that your inheritance stayed in your family.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.160]   Right?
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.820]   Every 50th year.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.940]   Now whatever happened, and maybe you became an indentured servant and you began to serve
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.480]   another family, but every 50th year you would be freed and be wiped out and you get to start
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   over.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   Okay?
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.560]   So it ensured that the inheritance that God promised the nation of Israel stayed within
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.840]   that tribe, within that family.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.800]   Okay?
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:30.780]   So, secondly, it made sure that they understood that none of this was theirs to begin with.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.460]   Does that make any sense?
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.640]   How many of you play Monopoly?
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.380]   A lot of you play Monopoly.
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.380]   Right?
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:49.040]   How many of you at the end of playing Monopoly, like, just lose it and can't sleep because
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.640]   you lost your property?
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.640]   Right?
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:58.280]   They came and, you know, one guy just had a Monopoly and then like every other block
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.360]   you had to pay money and then you got bankrupt and then you got out of the game and you were
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.600]   huffing and puffing for weeks and weeks.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.640]   Right?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.800]   Because it was play money.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.640]   You might be competitive, but when it's done, it's done.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.280]   There was no consequence because it was never yours to begin with.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.600]   It was only yours while you were playing that game.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   Right?
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:24.560]   So, the year of Jubilee was a constant reminder to the nation of Israel that their inheritance
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.920]   ultimately is God's.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.400]   It wasn't theirs.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.500]   Right?
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.880]   So imagine what that would do.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.000]   Even though you owned the land and you were working, you were working hard, every 50th
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.360]   year, if God said, "You know what?
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   Start over."
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   Right?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.240]   You were constantly, like, you would have held onto your property pretty loosely.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Right?
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.960]   It would have prevented you from being overly greedy.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.840]   You could be a lot more gracious when you know it's not your money.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   Right?
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.940]   I remember about six, seven years ago, I gave a sermon about that, about being generous
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.360]   and being good stewards and some of you guys were here when I did that.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.000]   I gave somebody a $100 bill before the service, you know, and I pretended like I wanted it
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.680]   from him and I took it, you know, and then I decided to hold onto it and then people
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   were like, "Oh, man, you know, like, how could he take his money?"
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.800]   And then later on I told them that was my money to begin with.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   Right?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.880]   And then people were like, "Oh, okay, then it's okay."
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   Right?
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.360]   Well, in the same way, the year of Jubilee was basically taught the nation of Israel
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.400]   like the creation is His, the money is His, the cattle is His, and that's what the tithing
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.160]   was meant to do.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.640]   Tithing was our voluntary act of showing God that this is not mine but yours.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.040]   But the year of Jubilee made sure that that message got across.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.400]   Right?
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.140]   And so if you knew that everything that you owned would eventually be distributed back
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.360]   to the people who had it, I think people would be a lot more generous.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   Right?
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.600]   Either you give it voluntarily or God's going to make you give it anyway.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   Right?
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.800]   So, again, ultimately all of this points to something bigger than the nation of Israel.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.000]   And as you guys know, everything in Leviticus points to something bigger.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Right?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.200]   But in the nation of Israel, this is what God was trying to teach them.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.880]   Five, exhortation to obedience, verses 18 to 22.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.360]   The success of their harvest is dependent upon God, not just the land.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.760]   Verses 18 and 19.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.840]   You shall thus observe my statutes and keep my judgments so as to carry them out that
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.280]   you may live securely on the land.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.920]   And the land will yield its produce so that you can eat your fill and live securely.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.880]   In other words, if you do this, God's going to take care of you.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   Right?
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.880]   You're going to work hard.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.560]   Some of you are going to be more successful than others.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.160]   But if you learn to be generous and to be gracious, God is going to multiply what you
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   need.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.360]   B, God promises enough harvest for three years on the sixth year of the Jubilee year if the
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   Jubilee years obeyed.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.400]   So verse 22, if you say, what are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do not sow
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.640]   or gather in our crops?
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.600]   Then I will so order my blessing for you in the sixth year that would bring forth the
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.560]   crop for the three years.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   But it will bring enough for the sixth year, seventh year, and the eighth year.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.560]   Right?
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.920]   If you trust me.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.520]   So if you are gracious and you practice this command and you give the land back and you
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.400]   free the people who are in captive, right, because of that, he said the Lord is going
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.880]   to multiply threefold what you do.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.560]   So this would have forced them, right?
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.600]   It would have forced them to every 50th year to trust God.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.320]   Do you trust me to take care of you or are you going to hold on to it, right, because
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.000]   it's in your hands?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.560]   It's in my hands, it's for sure, but if you give it to God, God will give you abundantly
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.560]   more.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   Right?
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.760]   So either your faith is going to increase or your finances are going to increase, but
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.560]   your faith is going to decrease.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.000]   Right?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.560]   Next, the laws concerning redemption to those who become poor during the year of Jubilee.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.280]   The law addresses four different levels of poverty.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.920]   First one, if a crop failed and an Israelite had no savings, he would have to borrow money
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.960]   in order to buy seed to plant the following year.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   Right?
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.160]   So this is how they would begin to get into debt.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.760]   Because they were primarily farmers, if they farmed, there wasn't enough rain, they didn't
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.000]   do a good job.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Right?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.320]   So whatever the reason, then they would have to borrow money.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.160]   So in order to do that, they would borrow money to do that.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.400]   Two, if the crop failed, he might have to sell some of his land to cover his debts as
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.240]   well as borrow more money for the seed.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.280]   Right?
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.440]   So the first one is just, you just need to borrow money.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.880]   Second one is that you're in such debt that you begin to have to sell some of your property
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.440]   to get this back or to keep it going.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.680]   Thirdly, if the crop failed, he might have to sell his remaining land to cover the debt.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.560]   In other words, you're foreclosing on your home, your land, your cattle.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.320]   So you're basically losing everything that you own.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   That's the third level.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.320]   So it's getting worse.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.200]   And then the fourth, final one, if significant debt remained as a result of these failures,
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.520]   he would be forced to sell himself to cover the debt.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.080]   So he would become an indentured servant.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   Right?
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.920]   So he says, when these things happen, this is the way that they are to be redeemed.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   Right?
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.520]   And he gets into that in the next section.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.880]   So as you know, each of the 12 different tribes were given their portion of land once they
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.400]   entered the promised land.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.480]   The land was not to be seen as their own, but the Lord's for them to be stewards of.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.640]   Verse 23.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.600]   So the Jubilee year prevented one tribe from prospering and taking over the lands of the
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.480]   other tribes, creating a permanent economic disparity.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   Right?
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.880]   So this isn't necessarily communism.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:15.840]   So this is probably how a father or mother would be with their children, if they could.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.800]   Right?
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.900]   So it's not to say that everybody owns everything equally.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:27.000]   He wanted to make sure that one doesn't end up suppressing the other.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.560]   Right?
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   So let's see.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.920]   We're going through this pretty fast.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.520]   The final part of it is, so how do you resolve it?
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.560]   And that's basically what the year of Jubilee is.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.400]   If an Israelite who becomes poor needs to sell his land, he had three options.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:50.000]   Now, first one, it's going to sound very familiar to you if you know the book of Ruth.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Right?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.600]   First, the nearest relative would be given the rights first to buy it from him.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.960]   Okay?
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.400]   What is the technical term that is used in the Bible?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.640]   Where does that come from?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   The book of Ruth.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   Right?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.040]   The kinsman, who's the kinsman redeemer in the book of Ruth?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   Boaz.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.040]   Right?
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.400]   Yeah, I'm not going to go over the story.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   Okay?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.600]   So I'm just assuming you guys know the story of the book of Ruth.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   Right?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.560]   So the book of Ruth, a Moabite woman follows her mother-in-law, Naomi, because the father
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:34.320]   and her husband dies, comes in, and then the nearest kin, who happens to be Boaz, basically
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:41.520]   takes them in, and basically their misfortune turns into a great fortune because of the
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.960]   kinsman redeemer.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.080]   So that is stated in the law.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.000]   This is part of the law that God gave to the nation of Israel.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Right?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.600]   And the reason why he did that was he wanted to make sure that the wealth and the land
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.040]   and inheritance stayed within the family.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.080]   Right?
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.600]   So he made it a law that if you had a relative, that they were the first ones responsible
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.320]   for the well-being of the members of their family.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.840]   Do we see that in the New Testament?
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   Yes.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:16.880]   Paul tells the church, right, that we're first and foremost responsible for our own family,
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   to take care of them.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.240]   He says if he does not take care of his own family, he is worse than an unbeliever.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:26.080]   So he says before you take a widow and put them on the list of people to take care of,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.120]   he says first make sure that the family is involved in taking care of them.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   Right?
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.440]   So that same principle is what's being taught.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.840]   So the first line of defense against poverty is their own family.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   Right?
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.160]   Kinsman redeemer.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.480]   Two, if first option was not possible, the person can redeem it themselves.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.760]   God gave them a period of a year for them to work different things.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.720]   Even though they're in debt, they had a year to pay it all off and redeem whatever it was
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.120]   that they sold.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.960]   Thirdly, if both was not possible, the first line of defense is the kinsman redeemer coming
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.000]   and helping your family members.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.680]   Second line is to buy some time, maybe sell other properties, maybe try to work hard in
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.880]   the harvest and then gain the money and to gain your property back.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:21.320]   But third, if both options above is not possible, the Lord will become the redeemer and redeem
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.040]   the land back for him at the year of Jubilee, which is basically when you absolutely have
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.200]   no other way to redeem it on the year of Jubilee, God would revert it back.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   Right?
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.600]   By command.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.440]   So some of the guidelines that he gives in doing that, number one, Israelites were not
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.120]   to treat another Israelite who sells themselves as a permanent servant, but as a hired resident
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   until the year of Jubilee.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:55.400]   In other words, if a Jewish brother got into such poverty that he had to sell himself or
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:01.160]   have to become a servant for a period, that he was never to be treated like a slave, but
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.360]   a hired servant for a short period of time.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.480]   And then when the year of Jubilee came, he was to be freed.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.720]   Two, during the period of servitude, the master was not to treat the servant ruthlessly.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:20.000]   The reason why he puts that in there is because the slave had absolutely no rights.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.200]   They could have done anything they wanted to a slave, but God made sure that another
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:32.800]   Israelites would not be treated harshly because of this financial situation.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.200]   But this was specifically prohibited against other Israelites.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.600]   Number three, this law only applied to fellow countrymen, not to aliens who lived among
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   them.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.720]   So if a foreigner came in and ended up becoming a slave, they would be a slave.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.760]   Not that they could possibly buy their freedom back, but the year of Jubilee did not apply
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   to the aliens.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   Okay?
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.280]   This was only to the Jews.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.640]   And again, all for the purpose of making sure that God's inheritance toward the nation
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:12.680]   of Israel was kept within that tribe, within that family.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.560]   So before you go on and say, "Hey, that doesn't sound fair.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.160]   How come only the Israelites are protected and not the aliens?"
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:24.440]   Remember, all of this is ultimately to point and to prepare the world for something greater.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   Right?
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.640]   So all the sacrifices, all the tabernacle, all the rituals of cleansing, all of this
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.480]   ultimately is fulfilled in Christ.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.940]   Right?
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:44.960]   So this is the part that I want you to make sure that you understand.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.920]   Number seven, Jesus fulfills the year of Jubilee.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:57.520]   And it's pretty clear because in Luke chapter 8, 14 to 21, if you can put that up there.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.520]   Remember where this takes place?
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.520]   Jesus goes back and this is happening in the beginning of Jesus' ministry.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:10.240]   He goes back to Nazareth and he enters into the synagogue and he opens up Isaiah and he
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.600]   reads this statement, which basically is the statement of the year of Jubilee.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   And he says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach the gospel
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   to the poor.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.640]   He has set me to proclaim the release of the captives and recovery of sight to the blind,
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.360]   to set free those who are oppressed, to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord."
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:36.040]   And then he follows up in the next verse and he says, "To this day, this prophecy is fulfilled."
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.160]   Right?
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.540]   Jesus says, "I'm going to fulfill this."
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.520]   And that's how he begins his public ministry.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:48.360]   In other words, the year of Jubilee is going to be fulfilled in Christ.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.640]   So everything that Jesus was doing on the cross, releasing of our sins, restoration
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.220]   of what was lost, right?
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.040]   And ultimately, salvation is restoration, right?
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.760]   Sin, fall, redemption.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.840]   That's the whole history of salvation, right?
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.600]   And so Sabbath was what was lost.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:17.340]   And so this concept of the Jubilee is to restore what was lost back to what God intended, right?
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.280]   So Jesus begins his ministry and says, "What was lost, he will restore."
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:30.160]   So if you go to the next passage, I want you to...
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.120]   Okay.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.960]   Remember when Jesus, when Peter came to Jesus and said, "How many times do you want me to
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.280]   forgive my brother?"
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.720]   He said, "Seven times seventy."
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.760]   Right?
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   Not just seven times, because seven times is the number of perfection.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.520]   So Peter says seven times, right?
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:55.760]   In other words, like, "You want me to be gracious and forgive him seven times?"
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.880]   And Jesus, "Not seven times, but seven times seventy."
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.120]   But the number seven times seventy is a very significant number, right?
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:09.040]   And the reason why, if you can go to the next one.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.760]   Okay.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.680]   Okay.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.840]   Israel enters into the Promised Land, and they're in the Promised Land for about 800
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.640]   years before they are taken into captivity by the Babylonians.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   When they are taken into captivity into Babylon, how many years were they there?
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.360]   Seventy years, right?
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.000]   But this is what it says in 2 Chronicles 36.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.280]   "Those who had escaped from the sword, he carried away to Babylon, and they were servants
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.880]   to him and to his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.400]   the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah until the land had enjoyed its Sabbath.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.480]   All the days of its desolation, he kept Sabbath until seventy years were complete."
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:01.320]   In other words, he's saying they're going to be cast out seventy years as a punishment
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.680]   for not obeying the Sabbath law, right?
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:12.480]   For seventy times that they didn't obey the Sabbath law, God's taking them into captivity.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   So until those seventy years are fulfilled, they don't come back, right?
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.560]   That's why they're there for seventy years.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:26.720]   Now, they didn't obey, so that means out of the 800 years, for 490 years, they didn't
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.160]   observe the Sabbath, right?
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:41.880]   Seventy years, every seventh year, seven times seventy, 490 years.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.000]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.140]   They didn't observe, so every seventh year that they were supposed to rest on the Sabbath,
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.280]   they didn't observe it for seventy times, right?
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.600]   And so as a result of that, the seventy times that they didn't observe it, God's going to
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:07.200]   send them out into captivity for seventy years, which means the 490 years of the time that
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:15.000]   they were in the promised land, they didn't keep the Sabbath, right?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.200]   So when Peter says, "How many times do I forgive them?"
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   Seven times.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:25.400]   When Jesus says seven times seventy, it was not a random number.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.120]   Those were the years that God was patient with the nation of Israel.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.640]   It was 490 years God put up with their rebellion.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:43.520]   It was 490 years God was patient, sending the prophets, prophesying, asking them to
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.160]   return and even after he sends them into captivity, he ultimately forgives them and restores them
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.080]   back.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.200]   So the seven times seventy wasn't a random number.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.840]   Those were the years that God put up with the nation of Israel and the only reason why
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:06.200]   they exist even at the time of Christ was because he forgave them over and over and
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.080]   over again.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.800]   So when Jesus says he had come to fulfill the year of Jubilee, right, this is what he's
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:21.260]   referring to, his patience, and ultimately applying an overflowing to us, spiritually.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.280]   Every single Christian has experienced the year of Jubilee, right?
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.400]   So sometimes you may not feel like that because it's financial and different pressures that
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:37.960]   we have, but if our ultimate debt is the debt of sin, right, relational issues, problems,
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   families, hopes, whatever scars that you have had from the past, right, whatever wrongs
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.200]   that you have experienced, right, the only answer is the blood of Christ.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.360]   So when he was crucified and resurrected from the dead, the year of Jubilee happened for
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.240]   all of us, right?
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.720]   All our sins were wiped clean.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:05.120]   The day of atonement happened and God allowed us to give, what, a new life, right?
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:11.160]   And that's what every Jew experienced every fiftieth year and every Christian experiences
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.760]   when he accepts Christ as Lord and Savior, right?
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:22.480]   I'm going to give you more time for discussion.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.920]   What is the purpose of the Sabbath in the new covenant?
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.400]   It was central to the nation of Israel, right?
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.080]   How is it important in the new covenant?
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.560]   Are we just done with it?
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:37.000]   Why is it important and what consequences are there if we do not adhere to the Sabbath
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.760]   teaching?
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:45.200]   We normally separate the law with grace, but the laws of the year of Jubilee is ultimately
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.280]   about the practice of grace.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.160]   So they were commanded to be gracious.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.120]   How should the teaching of Jubilee be applied practically today in our lives, right?
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.520]   Number three, how we view and use money is an indicator of where our heart is, right?
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.820]   Matthew 6, 21.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:06.440]   How does the use of your money reflect on your relationship with God and with others?
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.640]   Are you generous and gracious with your finances or is it primarily used for yourself and your
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   family?
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   How can you be more deliberate about the use of finances for God's kingdom?
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:24.120]   Okay, so let me pray for us and I'll give you time to discuss in your group.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:30.680]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, Father, for just being gracious to us, wiping out our
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:37.360]   sins, our debt that we could not possibly pay, that even in an obscure teaching, Lord
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.520]   God, like this, there's so much depth and meaning behind it.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:48.200]   We thank you for opening our eyes to know more and more each week what it is that you
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:55.060]   have done for us and that more that we understand, the more we would respond in a manner that
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.120]   is worthy of the gospel.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.960]   I pray for your blessing over our time of discussion.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   May it be fruitful.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.520]   May it stir our hearts, Lord God, to love you more.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   Amen.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.320]   Amen.
