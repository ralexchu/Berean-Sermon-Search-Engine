[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.380]   We're gonna go ahead and get started with Bible study.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:45.540]   How about we just take some time to just quiet our hearts
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.580]   and then we'll get into a time of praise.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.580]   (people chattering)
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.580]   (people chattering)

[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.580]   (people chattering)
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.580]   Father, we thank you for gathering us here tonight
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.580]   to study your word.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.580]   We thank you so much for being a God that is sovereign,
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.580]   that is always in control of each and every situation
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.580]   of our lives, and that your will is far greater than our will.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.580]   Now we can trust you.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.580]   When we're anxious, we know that you are our comfort
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.580]   and our joy.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.580]   We pray for tonight as we study your word
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.580]   that we would really seek to learn more about you,
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:16.580]   that we would really invest and long for
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:21.580]   the spiritual milk from your word.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.580]   We pray for this time of praise that you'd be honored,
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.580]   that these words that we sing
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.580]   wouldn't just be lip service to you,
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.580]   but you would receive all the praise and all the glory.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   So we love you, pray all this in your name.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.580]   Amen.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.580]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:08.580]   - All right, let me pray for us,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.580]   and then I'll read the passage,
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   and then we'll get our discussion time started.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:20.580]   Lord, we are very thankful that you provide for us
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.580]   in our week where we can study your word in safety
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.580]   and with many resources at our disposal.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   I pray, Father, that we would not
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.580]   take these things for granted,
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.580]   but truly to take advantage of all the opportunities
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.580]   that we've been given and really seek to be faithful,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.580]   stewards with the gifts.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.580]   And Lord, in turn, help us just to be good stewards
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.580]   with the relationships that we have
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.580]   so that the people that are in our lives
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.580]   truly will be blessed because we are near.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.580]   And I pray for just a good time of Bible study tonight
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.580]   that you would lead our discussion,
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.580]   especially when it comes to the application
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.580]   and the hypotheticals and perhaps even
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.580]   the sensitive situations that arise
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.580]   in discussing this passage.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   Thank you, Lord, for just the great joy
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.580]   of being able to study this together,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.580]   and we pray for your spirits leading and guiding tonight.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.580]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.580]   I'm gonna read the eight verses for today's passage,
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.580]   including one from last week's
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.580]   because there is a connection there.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.580]   So just try to track along,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.580]   and I know that when we read a long passage,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.580]   our brains can turn off,
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.580]   especially if we're already familiar,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.580]   but this is probably the most important part
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   of the Bible study where we're just reading
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.580]   the word of God just in its purity.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.580]   And so let me read this for us.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.580]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles,
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.580]   "so that in the thing in which they slander you

[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   "the ignorance of foolish men.

[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.580]   to the third one, 'cause the first two
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.580]   are what you kinda see every week.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.580]   What does it mean to do right?
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.580]   And that's a question that is gonna be
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.580]   very important for the application
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.580]   of the stuff that we're discussing.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.580]   What does it mean to do right?
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.580]   And so when you get a chance,
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   maybe you guys can go around even
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.580]   in defining this two-word phrase,
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.580]   do right.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.580]   And then at 8.20, we'll resume
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.580]   and we'll do just a wrap-up portion.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.580]   All right?
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   So we'll see you guys at 8.20.

[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:36.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:39.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:42.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:51.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:25.660]   Can we get the middle to sync with the sides?
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:37.620]   All right, more than in previous weeks,
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:41.140]   I feel like this week's, my little outline
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.260]   is of a little bit more importance,
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.340]   so we can kind of figure out how to look at this.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:53.180]   So I tinkered with this quite a bit, all right?
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:57.940]   So when I'm looking at the purple bold,
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:00.180]   I see all the imperatives.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:06.940]   And there's one big one, and then there's a few minor ones.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.660]   So the imperatives, submit yourselves,
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:12.260]   is kind of an overarching one.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:15.820]   And then what I also discovered is,
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.500]   there's this attitude that we have before God,
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.780]   and I highlighted them green.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.140]   For the Lord's sake, will of God, bondslays of God,
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.940]   fear God, all respect.
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.260]   So you know, in some translations,
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.900]   when you're looking at verse 18,
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:34.340]   are you fearing the master, or are you fearing God?
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:38.420]   The word is phobos, phobos, same word for fear.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:41.420]   And that word phobos keeps coming up.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:43.380]   Keeps coming out in 1 Peter.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:46.980]   And it's usually always in reference to God.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.620]   Okay, the NIV, I think, just straight up,
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.540]   makes it completely like in reference to God.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.540]   The other translations, you can just naturally read it
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:59.060]   as like, oh, respect your master with some fear,
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.780]   or like, have fear for that.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.420]   But I also included that as an attitude before God.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:10.540]   All the institutions, I just underlined them.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:16.060]   King, governor, men, foolish men, people, brotherhood,
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:18.820]   God, king, servants, masters.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:23.780]   And then I also included chapter three, verse one,
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:24.820]   and chapter three, verse seven,
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:27.180]   which is about the wives and the husbands as well,
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:30.540]   because I want us to see this theme and this pattern, okay?
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:35.700]   The red bolded words are the key words and phrases.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.380]   Hopefully you see that.
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.540]   And verse 15, for the for such, is very important,
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.780]   because depending on how you read it,
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.980]   is it the stuff that's coming before that,
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.420]   or is it stuff that's coming after that,
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:50.260]   so that's the will of God?
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.380]   Because if it's the will of God,
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:53.220]   we kind of feel like that's an important,
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:56.940]   like this is the will of God, like what part of this, right?
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.900]   So I'll highlight that in red.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.860]   The peach color is like howl.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.900]   The blue bold, I discovered in my observation
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.020]   of the original language,
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.140]   that the word act isn't even in there,
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.780]   so that was added.
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:13.860]   So if I'm looking at that as an imperative,
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.700]   oh, okay, it's not even an imperative,
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.940]   it's just a strong suggestion that's there.
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:25.180]   And then I noticed that all the other submits
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.540]   are all participles, they're not commands.
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:33.980]   So there is this overarching theme of being submissive
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:37.420]   for the Lord's sake to every institution,
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:39.700]   and then is being submissive here,
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:42.180]   being submissive here, being submissive here.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.020]   So that's what I noticed.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:50.300]   And then yellow is the stuff that God gives me.
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:54.340]   It's charis from God, like some favor,
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.060]   like but what is that?
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.160]   Is that the same thing as credit?
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.740]   Is that an eternal reward?
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:01.900]   Is it something I receive on this side of eternity,
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:04.860]   or basically I get extra kingdom dollars,
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.420]   or kingdom-like points, and I get extra square footage
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:08.380]   of my kingdom house.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.880]   What is this favor, what is this grace?
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.860]   And this is all important because I'm thinking,
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.980]   why is it worth suffering?
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.980]   And suffering's supposed to happen.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:21.700]   It's promise, it's guaranteed.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.100]   If, because they've hated me, they're gonna hate you.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:28.620]   2 Timothy 3, 12, all who desire to live a godly life
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.780]   in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.180]   So suffering's gonna happen.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.080]   So what is this charis?
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.600]   Is this like in the flesh, but God,
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.780]   I feel his nearness while I'm in the flesh?
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:41.900]   So these are important questions, but I highlight that,
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.380]   because that's kind of the reward.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.540]   And my fleshly response is, well, that's not that worthy,
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.540]   like going through all of the suffering for that?
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.340]   Humanly.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.220]   And so the way I have outlined it,
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.580]   the first section, it's all about the submission.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.080]   And there are kind of, I saw four categories.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.980]   The second section is all the folks, all the people
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.720]   that I'm supposed to submit to.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.860]   And then the third column on,
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.820]   it's all just kind of subordinate ideas.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:20.340]   So this helps me to kind of visualize
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:23.140]   what's the important stuff that I'm gonna be looking at
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:27.400]   the next three weeks, the next four weeks, right?
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.220]   And I also notice in the red,
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:32.180]   there's an in the same way for the wife,
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:34.580]   in the same way for the husband.
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:35.980]   So there's gonna be a theme.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:39.420]   And this is why I usually like to memorize a book
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:44.020]   before I teach it, so that I already, I know what's coming,
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.420]   so I can bridge it together.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:50.780]   And so that outline, hopefully, it's gonna help hedge in
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:54.000]   a lot of the thoughts that we have and the observations.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.260]   And I wanna show this slide again, okay?
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:03.260]   Exegesis is, we're trying to find what does God intend
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:08.460]   to say through Peter to this context
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.060]   that I apply today in my life.
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.820]   Exegesis is, well, I like this, so I'm gonna apply this.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:18.020]   I don't like this, so I'm not gonna apply this.
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:21.060]   I will pick and choose what I will submit to
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:21.980]   and what I won't.
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:25.580]   Exegesis causes me to be like, okay,
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:27.140]   this is what God's word says.
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:30.020]   It's truth, it's unchanging, I need to change.
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:34.500]   Exegesis says, I will change God's word to fit
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.780]   whatever I wanna have it say.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:39.660]   So exegesis is very important.
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:43.300]   And why is it important, again, for today?
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.540]   'Cause there are challenges in this passage.
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:48.580]   Because if you're like me, when you're reading this,
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:50.800]   your mind goes to all the hypotheticals,
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.540]   all the exceptions, true or false?
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:40:00.140]   Yeah, well, if I'm supposed to submit myself
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:03.140]   to my master who's crooked or who's harsh,
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.140]   who's mean, how far?
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:07.820]   Right?
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:10.940]   If in the future, my daughter is in the workplace
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.020]   and her boss is flirting with her
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:15.620]   and making advances toward her, what do I say to her?
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:20.020]   Submit yourself for the Lord's sake to every institution.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.940]   I'm like, no, let me go talk to this guy.
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.220]   But is that a sin?
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.140]   And that's an important question
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:26.340]   'cause this is God's will.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.860]   You guys understand this?
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.260]   So my mind goes to all the exceptions,
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.700]   my mind goes to all the hypotheticals
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.620]   because this is a very weighty thing.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:40.440]   And my hypotheticals, my mind will even drift to,
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.900]   if I'm a Russian soldier, right now I'm a Christian,
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:45.380]   Putin tells me to do something
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:48.180]   that goes up against my conscience, what do I do?
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:54.420]   If the government says, church, shut down,
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:55.260]   what do we do?
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:59.240]   So the hypotheticals start coming into play.
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.380]   So this is a very important passage
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:04.700]   but also a challenging one
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:08.940]   and you have to acknowledge what the differences
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.780]   and the challenges are.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.620]   Okay?
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.440]   Some people will give up.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.860]   Well, then it's irrelevant.
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:14.860]   No, it's not.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:18.020]   There's a lot of stuff that we need to glean
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.420]   from chapters two, verse 13 to 20,
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:22.500]   but we just need to make sure we're doing it right.
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.340]   Right?
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.180]   So here's some challenges.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:29.200]   First Peter has general principles.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.300]   We get stuck on the specific applications.
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.860]   Well, what about, how about if, right,
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.540]   there's general principles
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.380]   and you're gonna discover that these general principles
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.380]   are in pretty severe times.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.680]   So I'll go into that a little bit.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:47.960]   Another challenge is,
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:52.420]   we're not living in a system where
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:54.620]   if your boss is mistreating you,
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.940]   you can quit your job.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.260]   Right?
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.800]   But in that case, it's an easy thing.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.900]   Well, if for the sake of conscience before the Lord,
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.460]   you wanna win him over to Christ,
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:09.020]   you decide to stick, that is honorable before God.
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:09.860]   Okay?
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:12.340]   So that's kind of, that's not that hard.
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.020]   So we, but the challenge is,
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.460]   when it comes to like, if we're living under a king,
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:20.820]   whatever he says usually goes.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:24.380]   But in a democracy where we actually can impact laws,
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:27.060]   how vocal do we become?
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.340]   That's where we do have to exercise some wisdom.
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:30.180]   Right?
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:31.680]   So there's context difficulties.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.100]   If you don't understand what's happening
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.900]   in the Roman Empire in first century,
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:38.380]   you might misapply stuff.
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:40.500]   Okay?
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:43.700]   And there are parts of this
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.620]   that you want to prescribe to your life
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.540]   that are supposed to be descriptive.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:54.260]   Which means a descriptive passage is this happened.
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:56.180]   The donkey talked.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.060]   That's descriptive.
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:01.500]   Prescriptive tells me to kind of do the same thing.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.540]   So if I'm looking at Balaam's donkey,
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:07.140]   I'm not reading that as a prescriptive passage.
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.220]   Well, I go to my animals at home and be like,
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.380]   give me a message from the Lord.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.380]   I don't do that.
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:13.220]   Right?
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:16.600]   So, but in this passage, sometimes we can confuse,
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:20.200]   this is supposed to be a description of a Christian.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.960]   And then I try to like find ways to kind of fit
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   and apply it in different ways.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.320]   So that's a little bit of a challenge.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.840]   And there's a natural tendency in your heart to isogee.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.200]   And so you have to be careful
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:40.040]   not to swing the pendulum too much over here,
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.720]   where whatever I do doesn't matter,
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.600]   or too much on this side where you're saying,
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.480]   well, this has to apply to every Christian
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.760]   across the board, all over the world.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.840]   Okay?
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.200]   Hard, fast rules, you need to be very careful to make.
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.120]   You guys get that?
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.040]   So there are challenges in this passage.
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.320]   This is from the New Testament survey class.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.500]   I wanna just kind of walk through a little bit of
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.040]   what's going on in the world of first Peter.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.060]   This will all be available to you on the slide
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.140]   after we're done with the Bible study.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.360]   So you can just look at that later.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.880]   You don't need to write it all down.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:23.960]   64, there's a great fire in Rome.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.800]   Nero blames the Christians,
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.820]   and that triggers a great persecution
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:32.480]   throughout the Holy Roman Empire.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.800]   8066, Jews in Jerusalem revolt.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   Jews and Christians are not distinguishable
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.040]   to Roman citizens.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:48.260]   So here's the thing with Christians that were easy targets.
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:51.660]   Christianity was seen as a cult of Judaism
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:55.140]   in early history.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:59.540]   And cults are sometimes very weird.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:02.840]   And there's a lot of assumptions on how cults work.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.320]   So in this period of time,
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.440]   they had misassumptions of what Christians did
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.940]   when they gathered secretly.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:13.420]   They thought Christians practiced homosexuality
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:17.180]   because of the Philadelphia, they practice in brotherly love.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:18.620]   So they're like, is that a code word
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:22.700]   for like homosexual practices?
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:29.300]   The Roman world also assumed the Christians did
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:34.120]   some kind of a weird cannibalistic ceremony
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.860]   because they were eating blood or drinking blood
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:38.620]   and eating a flesh.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:42.660]   So if you're not part of it, you have assumptions.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.020]   So Christians were easy targets,
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.660]   but the biggest offense of Christians
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.060]   is that they were monotheists.
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:53.980]   We believe in one God, and the emperor's not him.
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:57.700]   And the Jews had the same problem.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:03.400]   So the Roman world hated the Jews and the Greeks.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.020]   All right, sorry, the Jews and the Christians.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.460]   And they didn't distinguish.
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:14.520]   So there is, boom, persecution.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:20.060]   And the Jews get all feisty.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:25.060]   So in AD 67, Rome actually declares war on Israel.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.620]   150,000 Jewish inhabitants in Judea and Galilee
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:30.420]   are killed at the onset of this war.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:33.620]   Paul's beheaded, Peter's crucified.
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.220]   In the blue, I just kind of distinguish
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:38.720]   because somewhere in there is the context of 1 Peter.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.820]   You guys get that?
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:44.500]   And I wanna turn your attention over to your right,
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:45.700]   and I'm gonna read this.
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:50.060]   Nero launches an imperial persecution against Christians
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.580]   throughout the empire and against anyone
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:54.200]   who would not declare allegiance to him.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.980]   This proves to be the first and most intense persecution
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.740]   in Rome's history.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:00.820]   Some are covered with the skins of wild beasts
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:03.620]   sent into arenas to be torn apart by dogs
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.360]   while others are crucified.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.300]   Many others are burned, their bodies first clothed
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:09.940]   with pitch, paper, and wax,
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:12.740]   and then fastened to stakes through their throats.
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:16.180]   At night, their bodies are lit up as torches to give light,
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.220]   especially to provide light in Nero's garden
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.140]   so that he could put on circus shows.
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.660]   And this time of persecution lasts
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:23.720]   until Nero's death in June 68,
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:26.740]   a period of three and a half years.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:31.660]   Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution,
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:33.380]   whether to the king as the one in authority
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.500]   or to a governor.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.500]   This sucks.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:49.300]   And also, we are also looking at bond slaves today.
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:57.140]   And to the crooked master, right?
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:59.840]   And they translate it all differently, but crooked.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:06.380]   Seneca was Emperor Nero's tutor as a child
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:08.340]   and an advisor as an adult.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:12.320]   So Seneca stayed with Nero for most of his life.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.020]   And Seneca, making an observation,
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:19.060]   he's speaking against the abuses
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:21.420]   of the masters on their slaves.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.980]   So this is what he says.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:27.300]   Okay, so this is not like an endorsement.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.340]   This is actually him saying, let's not do this, guys.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.700]   All right, so this is what Seneca says.
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.380]   You may take a slave in chains and at your pleasure
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.620]   expose him to every test of endurance.
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:42.440]   And that's the, he's allowing for that exception.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.780]   But too great violence in the striker
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:47.060]   has often dislocated a joint
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:51.100]   or left a sinew fastened in the very teeth it has broken.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:55.080]   Anger has left many a man crippled, many disabled,
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.060]   even when it found its victims submissive.
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.820]   (pages rustling)
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:04.740]   Servants, be subject to your master.
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.620]   So this is pretty heavy stuff.
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:10.940]   How would you like to be told to be subject
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.300]   for the Lord's sake for this?
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:15.900]   It's pretty intense.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:26.860]   So when it comes to our response to the government,
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:30.260]   our response to crooked bosses and leaders,
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:34.200]   I think 90% of the situations, you'll know what to do.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.980]   Right?
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:41.720]   But when it comes to very tricky things,
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:48.900]   in World War II, it's a lot of Christians hid the Jews
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:52.140]   and they straight up lied to soldiers that were coming by
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.380]   saying, do you have Jews in your house?
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:56.980]   (pages rustling)
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:59.740]   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, actually one of the early pastor,
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.820]   he even said, you know what, if I have a chance,
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:02.940]   I'm gonna kill Hitler.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:10.260]   So it almost seems like there are exceptions
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:14.580]   when the government is demanding ridiculous things.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:17.980]   Right?
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.180]   And that's where it's difficult for us to say,
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:22.900]   this is a hard, fast rule.
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:26.900]   Disobedience to God's word on this is a sin
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:28.600]   'cause we have to be very careful.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:34.100]   So when I'm looking at what is my attitude
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:39.100]   and response to a government mandate or my bad employer?
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:42.340]   Actually, I don't have a bad employer,
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.140]   I have a great employer, Pastor Peter.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:46.260]   (audience laughing)
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:48.740]   You, when you have a bad employer, okay?
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:54.660]   So what does First Peter two have to say to all of this?
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.380]   Is what I wanna look at.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.580]   Get wisdom from here.
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:00.020]   Because sometimes my problem is not my knowledge.
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:04.180]   Knowledge sometimes leads people to being fools
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:06.340]   'cause they think they're smarter than they actually are.
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.180]   Okay?
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:10.540]   I need more wisdom from God in these situations
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:12.820]   rather than more facts.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:13.940]   Would you guys agree with that?
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.700]   Our problem is not a dearth of knowledge.
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:20.180]   Our problem is we have a bunch of people who are dumb,
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:21.780]   who think that they're really smart.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:23.940]   Okay, so what does First Peter two have to say?
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.100]   Because it will enlighten me a little bit.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.180]   What does the whole of the epistle of the First Peter
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.900]   have to say, directly and indirectly?
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.580]   What do the other epistles have to say?
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:33.580]   And we looked at a little bit of this in Titus.
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:34.920]   And what does the whole Bible have to say?
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:37.900]   Because we wanna exegete, not isageete.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:41.140]   So we're gonna have to look at that.
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:43.420]   Okay, now I'm gonna do only one step for you.
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:48.580]   This is what else is being said
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.060]   in First Peter chapter one, verse three,
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.740]   that's very simple to understand.
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:57.660]   One, you're protected by the perfect power of God.
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:58.480]   Hallelujah.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:03.580]   The only one you need to really fear is God, amen?
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:08.300]   You will suffer as a Christian for the name of Christ,
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.140]   true or false?
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.220]   It is guaranteed.
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.380]   The form, I can't predict, but you will suffer.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.360]   You will be persecuted.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.540]   You will be hated.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.700]   That's in the scriptures.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:24.980]   But we're protected by the power of God for salvation
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:27.340]   that is ready to be revealed when?
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.180]   In the last time.
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:29.300]   And in this, we greatly rejoice,
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.420]   even though now for a little while
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:33.820]   we are enduring the fiery trials, okay?
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:40.240]   But a believer, prescriptive and descriptive,
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.220]   is sober in spirit.
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:46.300]   A believer is called to be holy.
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:49.840]   A believer is to fear God, not men.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:54.580]   The word phobos is translated in different ways
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:56.820]   in First Peter, depending on the translation.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.060]   But it's the same word in the Greek, phobos, phobos,
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:02.120]   phobos, phobos, okay?
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.040]   But we're supposed to fear God, phobos God, not men.
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:09.300]   Believers are loving, especially toward other believers.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.020]   Believers do away with malice, deceit,
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:13.480]   hypocrisy, envy, and slander.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:16.660]   'Cause that hinders longing for the word,
[01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:18.820]   if you guys remember from a couple weeks back.
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:20.020]   We feed and grow.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:24.300]   We abstain from fleshy lusts.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:28.340]   We don't use freedom in Christ as a license to sin.
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:35.180]   Believers are not vindictive, right?
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:38.620]   If you're not applying this,
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:43.120]   your chances are you're walking in the flesh.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.820]   And those who are walking in the flesh
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:53.340]   do not have the mind or the spirit.
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:55.620]   And when you don't have the mind or the spirit,
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:58.020]   your reaction toward the governing authorities,
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:00.000]   your reaction toward your unbelieving husband,
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.460]   your reaction toward your unsubmissive wife,
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.740]   your reaction to your crooked boss is gonna be fleshly.
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:13.100]   The weapons we fight with are not the weapons
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:15.760]   of the world, 2 Corinthians 10, three and four,
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:19.320]   but they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:21.920]   But if you're not focused on this,
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.160]   but you're more worried about how clever
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.480]   your point is on Facebook,
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:29.480]   you're not winning anybody over.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:36.040]   Today's Christendom has a lot of social justice warriors.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:39.800]   You have a lot of people for seemingly Christian causes
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.840]   saying all kinds of stuff, being divisive,
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:46.820]   slandering leadership, slandering all of, it just,
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:50.700]   you're not catching
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:56.840]   the basic foundation of who you're supposed to be.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:04.620]   So this is not to say you can't be a voice
[01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:06.140]   for the oppressed.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:08.820]   This is not to say you can't do things
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.460]   to engage people online, but you don't need more facts
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:14.140]   and more knowledge, per se.
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:17.060]   You need more wisdom from God.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:21.440]   You need to be led by the spirit, not by the flesh.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.280]   What does it say?
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:25.420]   Abstain from fleshly lusts,
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:27.940]   which wage war against the soul.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:29.700]   Live such good lives among the pagans
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:31.100]   that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.020]   you may, because of your good deeds,
[01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:35.780]   cause them to give glory to God.
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:40.300]   So we really, our application,
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.740]   you don't need to worry about the exceptions
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:45.580]   on a day-to-day basis.
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:48.300]   The hypotheticals on a day-to-day basis.
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:51.540]   If someone were to intrude into my house, what would I do?
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:52.380]   And some of you guys are thinking,
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:53.900]   no, you need to be prepared, PPC, right?
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:56.500]   But if someone were to intrude in my house,
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.820]   I'm gonna throw down, okay?
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:00.940]   If it's someone trying to hurt my family,
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:03.140]   I'm not gonna be subject to that.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:05.700]   Okay, that's a completely different topic.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.580]   But on a day-to-day basis,
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:10.060]   my obsession needs to be that.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:12.980]   So if these are not in place in the Christian life,
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:15.900]   the God-honoring attitude toward human institutions
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.020]   will likely be fleshly,
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:20.120]   and the word corrupt appears again and again in 1 Peter.
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:23.380]   But you've been saved,
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:26.120]   blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.620]   who according to his great mercy
[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:31.100]   has caused to be born again to a living hope, right?
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:34.340]   And then verse four talks about our inheritance,
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:35.580]   which is what?
[01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:37.260]   Incorruptible.
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.620]   So we need to be worried about this stuff,
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:40.920]   first and foremost.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.580]   Here's a wrap-up,
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:49.100]   and Peter himself wraps it up with a to sum up.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:53.060]   You guys get that?
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:53.900]   To sum up, he said,
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.500]   in the same way, in the same way, in the same way,
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.660]   be submissive, be submissive, submit, live.
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:00.760]   In the same, and then he goes to sum up.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.760]   All of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:10.540]   kind-hearted, and humble in spirit.
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:15.080]   While you're trying to sort out what is God's will for me
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:20.080]   in this particular situation, at my work, in my government,
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:20.920]   what is it?
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:26.400]   Not returning evil for evil, or insult for insult,
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.040]   but giving a blessing instead.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.520]   For you were called for the very purpose
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:32.960]   that you might inherit a blessing.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:34.920]   And here's an Old Testament quote again.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.480]   For the one who desires life, to love and see good days,
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.300]   must keep his tongue from evil,
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.220]   and his lips from speaking deceit.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:46.720]   He must turn away from evil and do good.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.360]   He must seek peace and pursue it.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.440]   For the eyes of the Lord are on the, toward the righteous,
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.920]   and his ears are attended to their prayers.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:57.320]   But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.680]   How much damage is being done in the name of Christ
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.660]   by fleshly church people saying all kinds of stuff
[01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:06.440]   with recklessness?
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:13.000]   You guys following this?
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.520]   Remember, our minds will go to the hypotheticals.
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:19.680]   Our minds will go to the exceptions.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.200]   But the application and the energy for us to seek
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:26.000]   to submit ourselves, hipotasso, to the word of God,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.400]   first and foremost, is the list
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.960]   that I showed you right before.
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:32.680]   So I'm gonna show you this again.
[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:35.900]   (pages rustling)
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:39.260]   I wanna look at the green again.
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:47.740]   Whether you eat or drink, whether you suffer or laugh,
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:51.300]   whether you worship through singing,
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:52.900]   whether you worship through listening,
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:55.740]   whether you worship through evangelizing,
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:58.100]   whatever you do, do it all for what?
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.460]   For the glory of God.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:04.200]   For the Lord's sake, this is the will of God.
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:05.680]   You're a bond slave of God.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.460]   Fear God.
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:09.220]   Respect toward God.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.220]   Conscience toward God.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.360]   And he responds with charis.
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.480]   Grace and favor.
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:21.160]   Now, I have all kinds of questions on what charis is.
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:22.840]   That's my daughter's name, so I like that word.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.360]   But I'm like, is this like something I get later?
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.920]   Is this something that happens after I die?
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:29.880]   Or is this special protection on this side of eternity?
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:30.700]   That, I don't know.
[01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:32.640]   Those are inductive questions that I have.
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:36.140]   But there's all kinds of human institutions.
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:41.080]   And in all of these institutions,
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:45.360]   you should be the same person, inside and out.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:46.200]   Amen?
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:52.760]   In relating to all of these institutions,
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:56.120]   you need to give God fear first
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:58.920]   before we try to figure out
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.340]   what to do in the hypotheticals.
[02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:03.040]   You guys following the logic here?
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.980]   So, next week, we don't have Bible study.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:09.260]   We have praise and prayer.
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:11.160]   College students are going on retreat.
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:16.220]   And so, pray for them over the course of the next week.
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:20.200]   This is for the following Wednesday, March 30th.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.100]   The last question is the one that's different.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.980]   What does it mean, verse 21,
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:27.100]   if you guys do a little preview,
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:28.700]   for to this you were called, right?
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:30.880]   For Christ suffered for you,
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:35.400]   leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:41.540]   Next passage is pretty strong, okay?
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.460]   But then, what does it mean for me, then,
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:45.980]   to die to sin and live to righteousness?
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:50.320]   Is it merely a suggestion or a theological point of study?
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.420]   Or is it a command to be obeyed?
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:55.120]   And so, that's the part that my encouragement is,
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.140]   as you prepare this,
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:01.620]   filter your application toward question number five.
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:05.580]   And then, tonight, this is what you're gonna be discussing.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.060]   In what ways is your submission
[02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:10.740]   to the various human institutions in your life
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:11.620]   honoring to God?
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:16.860]   In what ways are you doing right?
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:21.080]   And this might be a painful reflection
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:22.420]   and confession for some.
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:25.660]   Question number two,
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:28.140]   what are the heart attitudes that were adjusted
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:30.660]   and affected through the study of this passage?
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:34.860]   Are there specific ways your group members
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:35.940]   can pray for you as you relate
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:38.140]   to the non-believing authorities around you?
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:43.340]   And I think the immediate application for you guys,
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:46.080]   a lot of it is just your workplaces, too.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.820]   Those are the things that I feel like
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:52.580]   you can immediately apply, right, the context.
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:56.300]   It's not Russia, it's not Ukraine for us.
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:58.660]   For us, it's here.
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:04.320]   And in the areas in which we minister as salt and light.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.740]   How do we need to adjust certain things?
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:12.500]   Even if it means you're suffering,
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.580]   suffering unrighteously.
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:20.900]   It's great credit, it's charis before God
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:23.780]   for you to suffer unrighteously,
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:28.620]   even in your own way, perhaps at your work, right?
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:30.980]   So let me pray and then we'll get to this.
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:37.780]   Lord, we really do need a lifetime
[02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:40.060]   to plumb the depths of just,
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:43.780]   just wisdom.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:48.620]   But Lord, as it says in the Proverbs
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:52.280]   that the fear of Yahweh, the fear of the Lord,
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.300]   is the beginning of wisdom,
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:59.420]   but it's also the source of life for us.
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:04.300]   In our lives, I pray that you would take center stage.
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:10.220]   Lord Jesus, help us not to just
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:15.620]   be religious people,
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.900]   but help us really to be obedient through and through.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:24.160]   And that is not something that we can do in our own strength.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.560]   Help us to grow up in our salvation
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:30.480]   as we long for the pure milk of the word.
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:36.120]   Help us not to be so entangled with this world
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:41.160]   that the hunger for your word gets quenched out.
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:45.760]   So we need your grace, we need your favor.
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:47.840]   I'm gonna pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:50.000]   (silence)
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.160]   (silence)
