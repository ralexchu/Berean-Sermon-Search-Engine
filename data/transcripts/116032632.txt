[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   My name is Alex Han.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.400]   I'm 30 years old and I've been a pastor at Berean Community Church for five years.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   I was born into a non-Christian family and so I didn't really have any background with
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.120]   Christianity when I was younger.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.800]   It wasn't until my youngest sister was born that my mom was introduced to the church.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.240]   There was this Korean grandmother that helped around the house because my mom had to deal
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.800]   with two kids and a newborn all by herself.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.000]   She was a Christian and so she invited my mom out to church.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.560]   From there, that's when my Sunday mornings became occupied with church.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.440]   I wasn't happy with it.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.520]   From there, that's basically when I was being exposed to the Bible and to the true Jesus.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.200]   I mean there was definitely streaks of disobedience.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.240]   I remember during high school just getting really involved with whether it be cussing
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.240]   or even pornography.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.080]   I mean these were sins that were pretty heavily embedded into my mind and into my heart during
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.480]   my high school years.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.380]   During that whole time period, I was just wrestling with sin and wrestling with whether
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.000]   I'm a Christian or not.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.040]   I mean living out my life as if I was cheapening God's grace basically.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.680]   I would say there were moments in my testimony where significant changes occurred.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.920]   I think the first significant change occurred in the summer of 1997.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100]   I remember going to a retreat.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.840]   When the message was being preached, he was making it very clear that Jesus was the King
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.600]   of Kings and Lord of Lords and that he died for his people.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   I just thought in my head that in most kingdoms, the king is usually the last person to die.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.680]   But for Jesus, he was the first one to die.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.600]   It was at that retreat where I gave my life to Christ.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.420]   I think the next significant moment was probably in college.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.160]   That's when I first started coming to Berean.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.760]   I remember being plugged into a small group.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.360]   It was during that time in my small group that I was reading the Bible more consistently.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.800]   I remember starting my devos in Romans.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.440]   Romans chapter 3 talks about how there is no one good, not even one.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.880]   There's no one who seeks after God.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.520]   I remember reading that verse and I was just utterly broken over not only my sins but the
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.360]   sins of others.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.120]   It really just gave my world a spin to see that truth and to finally have a better understanding
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.200]   of the faith that I have, to see the measure in which God has gone in order to redeem a
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.360]   sinner like me.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.280]   I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.320]   Oftentimes when these mistakes are made, there's guilt that occurs afterwards because you knew
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.280]   you did something wrong.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.880]   The question is, how do you handle this kind of guilt?
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.560]   Do you just suppress it?
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.240]   Do you just ignore it?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.480]   But there has to be some sort of reconciliation with that guilt.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.760]   You just can't ignore it.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480]   If you ignore it, then who are you really?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.600]   In my life, that guilt was really eating at my heart and it really caused me to wonder
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.400]   how will I handle this guilt.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.440]   It wasn't until I heard the gospel of Jesus Christ, hearing the good news of what Jesus
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.120]   has done for all the mistakes I've made, all the sins that I've committed, to understand
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.680]   that that guilt that I had will be lifted from my shoulders if I submit and seek His
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.520]   forgiveness and place my faith in Him.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.000]   That was absolutely liberating for me.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.040]   Even though I'm not perfect and as I continue to live my life, I know I'm going to make
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.960]   more mistakes, but I trust that my Lord will forgive.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.440]   That when I confess my mistakes to Him, that He will say, "All is forgiven.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.680]   You will be restored."
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.120]   That's something that was really key for me and continues to shape me now as a follower
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.840]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:36.280]   Bless me, Savior, who art Thine.
