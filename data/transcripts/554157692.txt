[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.120]   And today will be the final message on these three verses.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   Okay, I promise.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:34.400]   Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.000]   Reading out of the NASB, it says, "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   us.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.280]   Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.400]   author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you will
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.560]   not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   Let's pray.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would open our eyes, that we may see what you have ordained
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.480]   in your word, Lord God, to sanctify and strengthen your church.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.920]   Lord, if any of us has been drifting, we've allowed our hearts to be hardened, Lord God,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280]   toward the things that you give us.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.680]   Help us, Lord, to continue to be softened by your Holy Spirit and your word.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.600]   We pray that you would anoint this time and let your voice be heard, that your children
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.040]   will hear it and follow you and you alone.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.240]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.400]   I don't know how many of you are active on Instagram or Facebook, but I told people that
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.440]   I regularly stalk you.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.080]   So it helps me with the church, especially it's growing.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440]   If I'm not your Facebook friend, please make me your Facebook friend.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.700]   Don't make me beg.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.600]   Friend me so I could connect it and that way I can kind of know what's going on in your
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   life.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.920]   I observe that based upon what you put on your Facebook page or your Instagram, what
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.720]   you love, right?
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.520]   Usually you'll highlight certain things that you love and you care about and you put it
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   on your Instagram.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.680]   I'm not saying that that happens with everybody, but I could tell from a distance that some
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.160]   of you are foodies, right?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.800]   And all you have, you have no pictures of human beings on your Instagram, like zero,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   not even yourself.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.560]   It's all I see is the years and years of where you've eaten and just delicious food, the
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   best presentation.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.160]   So I can tell without you saying a word that you are a foodie, that you are willing to
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.320]   drive far distances to get the right food.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.260]   Some of you are travel maniacs because all I see on your Instagram pictures are the various
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.440]   places that you visited and certain places are beautiful.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.360]   It makes me want to go there one day.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.160]   So I could tell that you enjoy traveling just by what I see.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.960]   Some of you put up pictures of your friends.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   Whenever you meet together with somebody, you'll take a selfie, right?
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.040]   And then you'll put it on the Instagram.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.860]   And then so you have, I see various pictures of who you've had meals with.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.320]   And I know some of you who never post anything on Instagram or Facebook until you have your
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.360]   child, right?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.400]   There's no pictures of you.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.720]   You don't interact at all.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.320]   And then all of a sudden you become hyperactive as soon as you have a child and all the pictures
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.160]   that are on there are usually of your children.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.560]   Look at the spaghetti on his head.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.040]   It's like, oh, he used his left hand to cook or whatever.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   And then so everything that they do is exciting.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.080]   So your Instagram and Facebook presentation kind of reveals that these are things that
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.280]   you care about.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.000]   Whatever it is that we care about, we have a tendency to be willing to suffer many things
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   to do that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.640]   Some of you might like traveling, visiting new places, but you may hate airplanes.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's kind of like me.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.840]   I enjoy seeing new things and going to new places and seeing things.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.520]   But that process of getting there is torture.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.640]   I hate being on an airplane.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640]   I have a bad back.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.400]   And so I literally have to suffer through all that to get to the other end.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.200]   But the experience that you'll have on the other end is worth it.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.720]   So if you're a foodie, you may not like driving and you may not like L.A. traffic, but you're
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.160]   willing to go through all of that because you want to get there.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.360]   So depending on what you love and how intensely you love something, you're probably more willing
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.280]   to put up with inconvenience and trials to get what you want.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.220]   Well I say all of this because the motivation behind what Jesus did is clearly spelled out
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.560]   in this passage where it says, "Fixing our eyes on you, the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame."
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.800]   You know, previously we looked about how Jesus was going to the cross and he says, "It's
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.720]   time for me to be glorified, that I may glorify you, that you may glorify me."
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.760]   So to think of the cross knowing what it is, and the term glory and the cross really don't
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.240]   fit together, but Christ used the cross to glorify himself, to glorify the Father.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.140]   But this term here where it says joy and the cross is another term that is an oxymoron.
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.880]   You would never think that these two terms would be associated with the cross.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.800]   Because it was human depravity that they came up with this, this creative idea to humiliate
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.760]   somebody not only to carry out the punishment, but as an example so that nobody would want
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.480]   to commit that same crime.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.960]   And yet the Bible says the cross was a place where God and the Father was glorified, and
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.140]   then here it says he was able to endure the cross because of joy.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.760]   He did it because of joy.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.420]   So what was this joy that was big enough, great enough, deep enough that he was willing
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.540]   to endure the cross?
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.320]   So the more you love something, the more you are willing to put up with to have it.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.360]   So the fact that he was willing to endure the cross signifies that the joy that was
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.020]   coming was much greater than whatever he was going to suffer.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.000]   But what was this joy?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.080]   What was it that he had because of the cross that he didn't have before the cross?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.500]   You may say, well, the Bible says that he was lifted up, he became the King of kings
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   and Lord of lords.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.380]   Well, he was that before the cross.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.840]   He was the second person of the Trinity.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.480]   So he didn't need the cross to have glory.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.560]   He sat down at the right hand of God.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   He's God.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.700]   He didn't need the cross to be sitting at the right hand of God.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.460]   All the glory that you can think of that God had, he had before the cross.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.500]   So what was it that he was looking forward to, to enjoy, that even the shame and the
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.460]   suffering that was coming because of the cross, he was willing to endure?
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.100]   Now I remember the first time wrestling through this.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.860]   You know, I read this passage, I memorized this scripture, this part of it, and you know,
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.700]   typically we kind of hone in on, fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.740]   You need to endure, right?
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.160]   And then you hear a lot of sermons about not to be entangled with things that are encumbrances
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.500]   or sin that so easily clings to us.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.100]   And so you've probably heard a lot of messages on those things, but one particular day I
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.500]   was fixating on the joy that was set before him.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.440]   What is this joy that he's referring to?
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.660]   So I was combing through scripture and looking up commentaries and I realized a clear thing
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.500]   that he was saying, that the joy that was set before him is referring to me and you.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.700]   To me and you.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:02.020]   Everything else that you and I can think of as his exaltation, he had that and then some.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.120]   But what he didn't have before the cross is us.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.500]   And the Bible describes how he came to restore that joy in us.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   In fact, Ephesians chapter 1, 7-9 says, "In him we have redemption through his blood,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.660]   the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to his riches of his grace."
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.460]   His arms not being twisted, God the Father didn't grab him by the throat and say, "You
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.260]   better do this."
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.940]   Sinners were not the ones who forced him on the cross.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:36.420]   He volunteered, walked in, even as he was agonizing over the pain that was coming, he
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.260]   volunteered to lay down his life.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.940]   And he says this laying down of his life was a lavishing of his love toward us.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.900]   According to his kind intentions which he purposed in him.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.740]   Ephesians chapter 2, 4-5 says, "With God being rich in mercy, because of his great
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.100]   love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.060]   together with Christ, by grace you have been saved."
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.260]   I think I've mentioned this enough in our sermons, in our Bible studies and throughout
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:14.740]   the years, that you and I live in a generation where his love and mercy has been emphasized
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.420]   to the point where people have a very shallow understanding of his holiness and justice.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.060]   It's almost kind of like a given, like, "Oh, come God, come God doesn't answer prayers.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.860]   How come they don't do this for me?"
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.860]   People walk into brand new churches and say, "Oh, they didn't do this for me."
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.700]   So we have this entitlement when we come to God, "Why doesn't God do this for me?"
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.380]   Which is a very weird thing to ask.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:44.660]   Very weird thing to ask to come into the presence of God and think that God owes you something.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.100]   But because of the way that the gospel has been preached in our generation, an average
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.220]   person walks into church expecting God to love them, expecting God to be merciful.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.440]   So it's important for us to understand the balance that the cross is the perfect glorification
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.220]   of his justice and holiness along with his love.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:12.380]   But having said that, as important as God's justice is, as important as his love is, if
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:21.700]   we stray from understanding that the love was the primary motivation of why he came,
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:29.000]   the damage that that does is equally harmful as emphasizing just the justice.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.660]   He says the primary reason why he came is because he loved the God, so loved the world
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.040]   that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.420]   So the gospel is a glorification of God's love toward us.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:47.180]   He was willing to suffer the shame, the agony, the pain, the rejection, humiliation, all
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:54.140]   because there was joy waiting for him that this cross was going to produce.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:02.660]   We often think about the nation of Israel, and after we read the Old Testament, our primary
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:09.140]   emotions or primary idea of the relationship between Israel and God is that God must be
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.220]   so frustrated with Israel.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.100]   He's putting up with them, like I want to crush you, but because I made a covenant with
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.300]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I just can't.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:27.140]   So the picture that we have oftentimes is God is just about to strike, and right before
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.900]   he hammers them, he's like, "I made that covenant.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.140]   I can't deny myself."
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.260]   So he's just holding back.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.520]   Well, that's not how his love for Israel is described.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.960]   In Isaiah chapter 62, verse 5, it says, "For as young man marries a virgin, so your sons
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.820]   will marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.820]   you."
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:59.060]   I mean, he describes his love for the nation of Israel in the most intimate relationship
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:04.220]   between a young bride, in the honeymoon stage, where you just can't wait to get together.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:10.740]   He says the most intense love that we are able to experience, he says that's the way
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.700]   God loves his people.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.240]   Zechariah chapter 2, verse 8, it says, "For thus says the Lord of Hosts, 'After glory
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.920]   he has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you touches the apple
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   of his eye.'"
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.000]   You know that term, the apple of his eye, actually comes from this text, right?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.940]   I remember trying to do research, and I Googled and asked professors, "What does this mean,
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.240]   apple of his eye?"
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:43.260]   Well, apple of your eye is the part of your eye, you know, just basically the sensitive
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:49.580]   area in your eye, where all it is saying is, when somebody tries to come and touch you,
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.880]   what's your instinct?
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.800]   Your eyes don't get big like that, right?
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.140]   Instinctively, what happens?
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.340]   You close your eyes to protect your eyes, instinctively.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:04.500]   So if I come over there, right, and I just go like that, and if I get too close, 100%
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:12.020]   of you, unless something's wrong with you, your natural, instinctive response is to protect
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.860]   your eyes.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.900]   He's describing his love for the nation of Israel, that if anybody comes and touches
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.500]   you, it'll be like them touching the apple of my eye.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.780]   Instinctively, without even thinking, without calculation, he's going to act to protect
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.220]   his people.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.220]   That's how he describes his love for the nation of Israel.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.940]   Even as he pronounces judgment upon the nation of Israel to discipline them because of their
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.260]   disobedience, he says, Isaiah 49, 15, "Can a woman forget her nursing child?"
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.900]   Of course, this is a rhetorical question.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.420]   He's not asking a question, he's like, "Can they?"
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.420]   Can they do that?
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.480]   No, he's saying, "Of course not."
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.220]   The most sacrificial love that he can describe is a young mom who's nursing her child, and
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.820]   can she have no compassion for the son of her womb?
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.540]   But obviously the answer is a resounding, "No, of course not."
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.860]   Of course a nursing mom can't forget her child.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.300]   Of course she's going to have compassion on her.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:13.020]   But even these may forget, but I will not forget you, that his love is even greater
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.700]   than that.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.980]   Even as he is pronouncing judgment, he says that, "I will not, I cannot forget you," because
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.400]   he loves them this much.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.920]   As Jesus is coming into Jerusalem, as Jesus is coming to Jerusalem, he recognizes that
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   they're going to end up rejecting him.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.880]   Even his disciples are going to run.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:42.760]   You would think that the natural response of Jesus would be, "I've done as much as I could."
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:49.080]   God was so angered with the nations that at one point he wiped them out in the flood like
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   Noah during the time of Noah.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.000]   But yet he's coming into Jerusalem knowing that the very people that he's been patient
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.040]   with, that he loves, are going to reject him.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.800]   His disciples are going to run.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.400]   And instead of being angered, he has compassion.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:12.240]   It says he was weeping over the nation of Israel, wanting them to turn.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.640]   You know, every part of Scripture, even though, even in his anger, it is an expression of
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.920]   God's love for us.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.760]   Oftentimes we look at the book of Revelations and we say, "Wow, God is truly wrathful."
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.860]   A third of mankind dying because of disease.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.600]   And you see these instances where you have the seal judgments, you have the trumpet judgments,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.900]   and you have the bowl judgments, and every time a judgment comes, it gets more intense.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.560]   And you look at that and say, "Wow, God is truly wrathful."
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.960]   Revelation is not a revelation of the wrath of God.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.760]   Because the true wrath of God is not expressed in the Bible.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   All it says was, "The end shall come and you will be judged."
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.000]   The end.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.880]   That's where the true wrath is coming.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.600]   All that we see in the book of Revelation is a warning for sinners to turn.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.900]   Every bowl judgment, every trumpet judgment, every seal judgment is God pleading with the
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.600]   sinful world to turn and to repent.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.720]   If He was done with the nation, there is no drama of Revelation.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.520]   There's no seal judgment, bowl judgment.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.800]   You just, "I've had enough.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   You're crushed.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   The end."
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.500]   He just moves on.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:32.520]   But even in His judgment, God is being patient, wanting sinners to repent and come to Him.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:38.480]   That's why the Bible says that when one sinner repents, all of heaven rejoices.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.560]   And that's exactly what the Bible says, that He was willing to endure the excruciating
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.320]   pain, the humiliation, the rejection from His own people because of joy that He sees
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.840]   on the other side, meaning you and I.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.640]   That we would be restored to what we lost.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.600]   Ephesians 1, 4-5, it says, "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.960]   that we would be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   In love, He predestined us to adoption."
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.160]   Whenever the term predestination comes, it always causes a stir in some people.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.720]   It's like, "Oh, this seems random.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.600]   He predestined, He elected.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.720]   Arbitrarily, He just chose some and He didn't choose the other."
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.400]   He says, "No, it was not arbitrary."
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.800]   He says, "In love, He predestined us to adoption."
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   In love.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.640]   Now, I can't explain to you how all of that works.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.400]   I can only tell you what it says.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.280]   And what it says is, predestination is because of His love.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.440]   Election is motivated by His love.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.440]   He elected us, predestined us as sons through Jesus Christ Himself according to the kind
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.080]   intention of His will.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.760]   He didn't just forgive our sins.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.280]   In this pursuit of His own joy to save us, He didn't just say, "You know what?
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.880]   I'm going to prevent you from going to hell.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.320]   I'm going to die if you cover you with my son's blood."
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:11.840]   And if all He did was not kill us and not send us to hell immediately, we would owe
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.720]   the rest of eternity to thank Him because He saved us from eternal judgment.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.080]   But that's not how the Bible describes our salvation.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.980]   In Romans 8.15, it says, "For you have not received the spirit of slavery leading to
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.480]   fear again, but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry, 'Abba,
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   Father.'"
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   "Abba, Father."
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.480]   "Abba, Father" is the most intimate term between a child and his father.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.080]   "Abba, Father."
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   "Daddy."
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   Or "Appa."
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   Right?
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:49.880]   I remember when my children were younger, at some point, you know, turned 10 maybe,
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:55.520]   11 or 12, and right around that age, they got to start to being cool.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.920]   And their friends' opinions of them start to matter more than it should.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.680]   And so they kind of make their transition where right up to about 12 or 13, everything
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   that they know, they ask you first.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.000]   "Daddy, does this mean this?"
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.360]   It's like, and then you say yes.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.180]   And it's like, "See?"
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.720]   So their truth comes from their parents.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.920]   But at some point around 13, 14, all of a sudden, everything you say has to be tested
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.240]   by their friends.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   Right?
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.080]   You tell them something, and then they'll turn around and ask their friends, "Is that
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   true?"
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   And then they'll say yes.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   "Okay."
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   Right?
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.640]   Or they'll say, "Oh, my friend said this."
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.080]   And they start to challenging you at some point.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.040]   So I remember when my kids were right around that age, they started to change from "Daddy"
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.320]   to "Dad."
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.400]   And I remember hearing that for the first time, and I didn't want it.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.240]   "I'm not ready for you to grow up yet."
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.200]   So I forced them.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   Not yet.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   Right?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.760]   "I'm not ready to let go of you yet."
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.240]   Because that relationship that I had with my children, I wanted to hold on to as long
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   as possible.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   Right?
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.880]   I think every parent knows exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   Right?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.500]   To this day, they call me "Daddy" and "Mommy."
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.080]   And I know it may sound weird from the outside, but that's because I want that relationship
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.080]   with them.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   Right?
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   That term that is being used here, "Abba, Father," is the most intimate term that can
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.040]   be used between a father and a child, where God says, not only did He save us from eternal
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:30.560]   damnation, He raised us up as adopted children to call Him our "Abba, Father."
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.840]   Anybody else that calls me "Daddy" would be weird.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.320]   Right?
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.600]   Nobody would call me that.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.000]   Only my own children.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.760]   This love relationship with my own children will be calling me "Daddy" or "Mommy."
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.240]   He says He's using that term to say He raised us up for that purpose, so that He can have
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.840]   us for Himself, to love us.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.600]   He said that's the joy that was waiting for Him on the other side.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.880]   You know, Apostle Paul, you know, this man who hated the Gentiles, he was willing to
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.000]   murder because he was so nationalistic about his Jewish identity.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.920]   It's that man who says in the Thessalonians how he loved these people that he used to
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.880]   hate like a mother, a nursing mother, and as a gentle father.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.480]   You know, we may look at that and psychologize this and say, "Well, you know, maybe Apostle
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.200]   Paul has more estrogen than an average male, and that's why he has these compassions."
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   You know, maybe that's one.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   That's his personality.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.720]   He has a nurturing personality.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.680]   I mean, look at Apostle Paul before he met Christ.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.480]   See if you see any estrogen in this guy.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   I mean, this guy's gung-ho.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.960]   He's willing to die for Jesus or die for his purpose.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.800]   He says what he says because he is simply reflecting the love that he experienced with
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   Christ.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.640]   That was not generated within himself.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.080]   He was simply showing the love that Christ gave him.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.040]   That's why in 1 John 3, it says, "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.160]   that we would be called the children of God."
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:10.320]   Behold, look carefully and see what it is that you and I have.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:19.240]   Again, everything that we do repeatedly eventually becomes mundane, whatever it is, right?
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.520]   That one point, you know, you're so excited about something, but after you have it for
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.880]   a while, it becomes mundane.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   Even food.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.560]   Oh, I love this, but you have it all the time, every day, you know.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.080]   It's like, oh, we're having beef.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.720]   I remember when I was younger, you know, steak was—it's not like today where it's like,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.960]   oh, I want steak, so you have steak tomorrow, right?
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.000]   When we were younger, steak was not available.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.440]   We would go to Sizzler's and that was like a huge event.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.680]   Huge event, once or twice a year, right?
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.360]   But now it's like, we have steak every day.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.720]   I had steak Thursday, so let's have something today.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.640]   I had sushi on Wednesday, so let's have something else.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   Everything we do repeatedly, we have a tendency to allow that to become mundane, right?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.720]   The love of Christ is one of those things that if you allow it to become mundane, it
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.680]   affects everything else that we do.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:18.880]   And that's why he says to behold, to continue to gaze upon Christ, who is the beginner and
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.420]   the perfecter of our faith.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:27.340]   As soon as the love of Christ becomes something mundane, it affects your worship, it affects
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:34.980]   your prayer life, it affects evangelism, it affects your fellowship, the true fellowship,
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980]   right?
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.420]   Not just gathering of people and doing stuff together, but true fellowship.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.300]   It affects everything that we do.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:48.820]   He says that everything that he endured on the cross was for the joy set before him.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:54.300]   Sometimes we think of sanctification as somebody who's not disciplined to be more disciplined,
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.740]   or somebody who didn't know the Bible to know the Bible.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.420]   We didn't pray that we ought to pray.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.620]   All of these things are external things that we ought to strive to buffet our bodies and
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.260]   make it our slaves.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:11.540]   But the primary understanding of sanctification is to restore God's glory in us that we've
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.180]   fallen short of.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.140]   You know what God's glory, God's image is?
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.540]   He created us to reflect him.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.420]   And that's what we've been separated from.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.580]   So when he restores us, he's restoring that image.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.100]   Let me give you an example.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.940]   I remember when Zachary, our second child, was born.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:41.660]   I remember the joy that he brought to us because he had a little dimple on one side of his
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.140]   mouth that you can only see when he smiles.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.140]   It's not pronounced.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.140]   In fact, I don't know.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.140]   Is he sitting here somewhere?
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.900]   Everybody keeps looking over there.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.020]   I don't even know if he still has it to this day, but when he was a kid and he would only
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.380]   see it when he cracks a smile.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.220]   The reason why it brought us so much joy is because Esther has the same dimple.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.360]   When she smiles, it's only on one side.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.460]   So I remember when he was an infant, every time he would crack a little smile, that one
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.220]   dimple would go in.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.140]   And for everybody else, we would look at that and say, "Really?"
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.780]   That little tiny little hole in his face brought so much joy to me.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:24.700]   It's brought so much joy because it was a reflection of his mom.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.580]   That little dimple, that tiny little one.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:35.660]   So I remember Esther and I just being so in love because of that tiny little dimple.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.640]   The Bible says that we've lost this image.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:46.220]   God created us for his pleasure, but when we withdrew from him, that image was tainted.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:51.460]   So when he saved us, he saved us in order to restore us and to restore that image in
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.940]   us.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:58.780]   And the more that we reflect who he is, the greater joy that it produces in him.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.300]   That's what sanctification is.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.780]   Sanctification isn't just externally behaving differently than you did before you met Christ.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:11.420]   It's that glory, that image that he created us for being restored.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.500]   That's what he's referring to when he says he endured the cross because of the joy set
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500]   before him.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.660]   In Colossians 3, 8, it says, "And have put on the new self who is being renewed to a
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.700]   true knowledge according to the image of the one who created him."
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:31.640]   That's how salvation is described, that we would be transformed to the true knowledge
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.060]   of the one who created him, to reflect him.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.660]   2 Corinthians 3, 18, "But we all with unveiled face beholding in a mirror the glory of the
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:46.180]   Lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.780]   the Spirit."
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:53.900]   So as we gaze upon his glory, his dimple is getting deeper in us.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:00.100]   His eye color, his heart, his desire, his righteousness, his love, all of that is beginning
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.520]   to reflect off of us as we what?
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.520]   As we do what?
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.500]   As we behold his glory and we are being transformed from one lesser form of glory to greater form
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   of glory.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.660]   That's how he describes sanctification.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.980]   2 Corinthians 15, 46, "Just as we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.860]   the image of the heavenly."
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:28.700]   So when the Bible describes and tells us early on in Hebrews, he says, "To enter the throne
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.140]   of grace with confidence."
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:39.820]   We have a tendency because of our works-based mentality, we have the tendency to think that
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.820]   when we're doing well, we did righteousness and we gave and we were disciplined that we
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.180]   can come into the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:52.100]   But when we're not doing well, you know, we're kind of like, "Oh shucks, I don't deserve
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.100]   this."
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:58.420]   And we're kind of barely, we'll get in because that's the only place we can get in.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:03.700]   There's something inside of us that constantly thinks that we need to be worthy.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.300]   But when he says to come to the throne of grace with confidence, he's saying because
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.060]   you're coming into your Abba Father's throne.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.820]   Yes, he is the King of Kings, but that's your Abba Father's throne.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:22.220]   You know, as children, you know, we think, "Oh, you know, my parents have..."
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.860]   At one point when you mature, right, hopefully all of you are already there, you realize
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:33.560]   how much every parent has suffered for you, right?
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:41.700]   Every parent, even the ones that you're mad at, they all sacrifice and suffer for you.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.580]   Imagine coming in one day, it's like, "You know, I'm going to make it up to you.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.740]   I'm going to give you a car, a nice car, right?
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.140]   It's an expensive car."
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.500]   And then give it to your parent and say, "Now we're even."
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.560]   Imagine how offensive that would be.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:07.340]   There is no way you can match, because every parent sacrificed everything they had in order
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.540]   so you can live.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:15.560]   You would have to give your life and do what they did to say you matched it.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   There's no way.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.500]   It's a, every gift that we give is a gift of gratitude, recognizing what they've done
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.500]   for you.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:27.580]   But there's no way that you can exchange what they've done for a simple car.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.620]   See, in the way that we approach Christ, that we have this mentality that if I'm more righteous,
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.700]   if I do more, somehow we have a better standing before God because we've done more and God
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.620]   is more at peace with us.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.340]   The primary thing that He, the reason why He wants us to come to Him is because that's
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.940]   the very reason why He died.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:52.220]   The very reason why He died and He suffered is that it gives Him joy to have us in His
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.720]   throne.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:00.600]   It gives Him joy to see us, to be near Him, to reflect who He is.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   God loves us.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.060]   It's not He loved us.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.900]   He loved us and that's why He did that, but He says He loves us.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:17.400]   You ever think why Jesus was constantly praying and again, our thought immediately is He needed
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   energy.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.880]   He needed energy because He had so much He needed to do.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.920]   He needed to pray so that He could be regrouped and be strengthened so that He could go out
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.000]   and do more work.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.680]   That's not a lie, but you ever think that maybe that's where Jesus wanted to be more
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.640]   than anywhere else?
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.960]   That He just went there because that was His home?
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:47.400]   Even if He had all the energy He needed, that's where He knew the love of Christ most intimately.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.560]   He just did it because that's where He wanted to be.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.160]   It wasn't a task to be done.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.360]   That's where He found rest.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.280]   That's where this love relation, He just went to the Father's throne because God loves Him
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.640]   and He loves God.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   That's it.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.600]   You ever think of prayer and your intimacy with Christ in that way, not just like, "Oh,
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   I'm a Christian.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   I need to do this.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.800]   You know, I need to make disciples bear fruit, so I need to pray and I need to do this."
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.120]   You ever think that maybe that when God wants us to come to Him just simply so that He can
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.560]   enjoy you and so that you can enjoy Him?
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.600]   Because that's the primary thing that He says while He did all this other stuff.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:35.520]   The Bible does say that, but the primary thing, primary reward for our God was ourselves.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:42.800]   Not only did Christ endure for the sake of joy that was coming as a result of His suffering,
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.520]   joy is the primary motivation why we endure.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.860]   If Christianity has become nothing more than a checkoff box because you have accountability
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.120]   and somebody's going to call you out if you don't do it, you're going to be shamed.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.880]   If that's your primary motivation to get to the next level or to be a good Christian,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.080]   if that's your primary motivation, eventually Christianity becomes a tremendous burden that
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.440]   you will not carry for long.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.200]   You will work hard, but it's not producing joy.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.920]   All it produces is what?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.960]   Thorns and thistles.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.080]   Just like it says, as a result of the fall, you will work, you will labor, but the end
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.680]   result is going to be thorns and thistles, and at the end, it doesn't produce life.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.600]   All it produces is death.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   He's writing this letter to people who at what point did all that God required of them
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   because of joy.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.880]   Here's chapter 1034, "For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:47.260]   seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.560]   a lasting one."
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.240]   Why were they drifting?
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.360]   They were drifting because they lost their joy.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.960]   It wasn't producing joy for them anymore.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.240]   They find joy in the world.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.980]   They find joy in traveling.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.760]   They find joy in food.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   They find joy in everything else, but with Christ as an obligation.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.240]   That's what a good Christian does.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:18.080]   And because of that, you go through the motion at church, do what's expected at church, but
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.920]   you feel alive somewhere else.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.480]   That's where it produces rest for you, somewhere else.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:31.600]   That's why we're constantly escaping, whether it's through media, whether it's through purchasing
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.840]   things, whether it's through friendship or traveling, because Christianity has become
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.840]   a burden.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:44.600]   In Hebrews 11, 24-26, it says, "By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.080]   the son of Pharaoh and daughter."
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.280]   Think about the temptation.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.160]   You and I are not tempted with that.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.480]   Nobody offered a billion dollars if we don't walk with Christ.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.180]   He said he didn't consider that, choosing rather to endure ill treatment.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.400]   He went from Pharaoh's house to being ill treated with the people of God, then to enjoy
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.240]   the passing pleasures of sin.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.960]   He realized that whatever temptation was there was only temporary, verse 26, "considering
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.760]   the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of Egypt, for he was looking
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.840]   to the reward."
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.760]   The reason why he was able to overcome that temptation is because he was tempted with
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.640]   greater temptation for the joy that was coming in Christ.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.000]   He didn't just will himself to follow Christ.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.840]   It's because he believed that there was greater joy in Christ.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:42.880]   First Thessalonians 1, 2-4, it says, "We give thanks to God always for all of you,
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.920]   making mention of you in prayer, constantly bearing in mind your work of faith, labor
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.740]   of love, and steadfastness of hope."
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.740]   You notice a difference here?
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.000]   What's the difference between work of faith and labor of love?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.400]   If you're a Christian and you have faith, you are working in some capacity.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.040]   Some of you are more mature, some of you are more disciplined, some of you know more theology,
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.560]   some of you are more giving.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.080]   So you can't be a Christian if you don't have faith.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.680]   But along with faith, he says, to labor of love.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.440]   And you know the difference between doing something because you love something versus
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.800]   doing something because you're supposed to do it.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.640]   There's a huge difference.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.360]   What's the difference between giving?
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   Right?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   I'm obligated.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.840]   How much?
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   What's the maximum?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.160]   You know, what is required?
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.160]   Is this mandatory?
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.240]   These are the questions that come from somebody who's in burden.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.400]   Burden because I have to do it.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.920]   And I'll do it because I'm supposed to do it.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.160]   Versus somebody who loves this.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   It's like, oh, Tuesday's Bible study.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.960]   So you do Bible study Tuesday and then you never open up your Bible.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.040]   Because Bible's a project that you're supposed to do.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   We pray.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   Oh, we have praise and prayer.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.160]   So we pray.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   So we pray and we're done.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   We've done it.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   We're finished.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.920]   Versus somebody who's laboring in prayer.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.840]   Fellowship.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.280]   Everything that we do, it just becomes a project.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.720]   So some of you are good at projects and some of you are not good at projects.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.140]   But that's not what he called us to do.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:21.200]   Labor of love is ultimately what produces joy.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.680]   Because we have joy, we end up laboring.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.280]   Jonathan Edwards.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:37.960]   Jonathan Edwards in his book Religious Affections describes true affection versus false affection.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.520]   And he says in his book, hypocrite is someone who is using God to get something else.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.640]   On the surface it looks the same, but God is being used that if I'm faithful, if I'm
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.440]   a good disciple, if I'm obedient, if I read enough, if I have enough theology, that there
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.840]   is good that God's going to bring upon me.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.520]   And so if your mindset is that, when things don't work out, all of a sudden we start to
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.040]   question the goodness of God.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.360]   Why didn't he answer my prayers?
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   Why doesn't he give me this?
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.400]   How come everybody else has it but I don't have it?
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.720]   If Jesus is a primary source to get something we want.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.680]   And he said those are false affections.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.880]   That's not biblical affection.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.160]   But he says God didn't call you, he said, but true affection for Christian is someone
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.880]   who has found Christ to be the supreme joy.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.800]   The greatest joy is found in Christ himself.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.320]   And that's what he means by if you drink of the things of this world, you will go thirsty
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   again.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.080]   If you eat of the bread of this world, you will be hungry again.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.440]   Momentarily, you may be satisfied.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.760]   But you will have to do this over and over again.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.440]   But the water that I give you will well up into eternal life.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.360]   And if you drink of it, you will never thirst.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.320]   The bread that I give you will well up into eternal life and you will never go hungry
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.240]   again.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.680]   Christ is not just pointing the right way.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.720]   Christ's primary call is to himself.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.840]   Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.600]   He didn't say, come over here so I can tell you where to go.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.520]   He says, come to me.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.760]   He wants to restore that glory that you and I had, the very reason why you and I were
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.080]   created to re-imprint that on us.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.440]   For his joy and for our joy as well.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.740]   In Psalm 1611 it says, you will make known to me the path of life.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.480]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.020]   In your right hand there is pleasure forever.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.340]   Do you believe that?
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.340]   Is that what you're pursuing?
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.180]   In John 17 verse 13, Jesus says in his priestly prayer, but now I come to you and these things
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.860]   I speak in the world so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:52.020]   He came not to burden us of more things to do.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:57.440]   We're not saying that righteousness and fighting sin, in fact the very next passage it says,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.180]   you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in resisting sin.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.700]   So it's not that he's not telling us that we need to fight against sin.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:13.100]   But the primary call from a sinner to be saved is to come and restore that love relationship
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.300]   with the creator.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.460]   To enjoy his presence as he enjoys our presence.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.500]   And it is that love that he uses to measure everything.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.620]   When that love is not there, it affects our fellowship.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.380]   It affects our worship.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.100]   It affects our prayer.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   It affects our joy, our very life.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.460]   John 10, 10 it says, a thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.740]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:53.060]   You notice here, the life he's referring to is not opposite of death where, you know,
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.820]   everybody exists forever.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.020]   He's not saying that he's going to get people who are not existing to exist.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.100]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.480]   The Greek word for that is bios.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.340]   The word he's being used here is zoe.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.180]   To feel alive is another word to say to joy.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.940]   That he may restore the joy that he intended.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.900]   And to restore that when we fell from that joy.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.420]   To love.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:26.100]   This love that he gave us is not something that you and I can muster up ourselves.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:31.740]   Let me, I want to conclude with this passage of love in 1 Corinthians chapter 13, right?
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:41.660]   Which is often used in weddings when a boy or girl is inspired by the beauty of whoever
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:48.180]   they're watching and they write a love letter, 1 Corinthians 13, because you're godly, right?
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.300]   Or you take that and you put it up on a wall so that you can be reminded of this beautiful
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.740]   love.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:58.460]   But I think in many ways that we apply this the wrong way, right?
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.460]   Maybe not wrong.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.740]   Maybe it's too extreme a word.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:05.700]   That it's not complete in the way that we use it.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:11.780]   The reason why he writes Corinthians is because this church, in their passionate pursuit of
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:16.980]   religious superiority, who's better?
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.300]   Who's more righteous than the other?
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.940]   And so people started to compare.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.980]   You know, the people who are disciples of Peter are more righteous.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.980]   People who are disciples of Apollos, he's more polished speaker, so he's more righteous.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.340]   Oh, Apostle Paul went around, risked his life and planted all these, he's more righteous.
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:40.340]   And so in their pursuit of religious righteousness, it caused divisions in the church.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.340]   Who's better?
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.340]   Who's not better?
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:49.420]   And so this division, again, the core problem was they were competing for righteousness
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.660]   and then that caused all kinds of divisions in the church and once the division came in,
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.380]   they started tolerating all kinds of sin within the church.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:03.500]   And so it is within that context that he is writing to them, the primary thing that you
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.860]   ought to be pursuing is love.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.900]   If I speak with tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a noisy
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.940]   gong or a clanging cymbal.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:18.300]   If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, let me stop right
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.340]   there.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.300]   All mysteries and all knowledge.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.980]   That means like you've mastered the Word of God.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.620]   You've mastered the Old Testament.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:34.020]   You've mastered Leviticus, the book of Numbers.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.460]   You've mastered everything that the Bible has to teach.
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.700]   It says you have all knowledge and all prophecy.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:46.580]   And if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, wow.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.380]   If somebody came and said, "Mountain, move!"
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.380]   Right?
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.020]   Our church is going to blow up to 10,000 tomorrow because people think there must be a man of
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.020]   God over there.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   He moved mountains.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.020]   I've seen that before.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.260]   But he says even if you have faith to move mountains, right, even if you have faith to
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   remove mountains but do not have love, I am nothing.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.700]   Right?
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.380]   Do you think he really meant this?
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.380]   You better say yes because this is the Bible.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.500]   Of course he meant it.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.780]   It's in the Bible.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:26.340]   I can have all of this stuff and yet you do not know love is nothing.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.580]   Verse 3, "And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor and if I surrender my body
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.580]   to be burned."
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.580]   He's talking about somebody who's being martyred.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.260]   This guy is so committed.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:43.740]   He's willing to die for the name of Christ, die for the gospel.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.180]   Even in his death.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:50.820]   If I surrender my body to be burned but do not have love, it profits me nothing.
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.100]   Wow.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.540]   It must be important.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.540]   So I need to practice this.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:03.940]   Everything is measured by this love, right?
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   Discipline is important.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.880]   Prayer is important.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.460]   Knowledge is important.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.780]   Sacrifice is important.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:16.260]   But the primary thing that we are judged by is by our love.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.700]   So let's practice this.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.700]   Do it.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   Starting from today.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.700]   Just do it.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.700]   Okay?
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.700]   Nike commercial.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.700]   Just do it.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.300]   Stop your whining.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.300]   Start loving unconditionally, right?
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.940]   Today.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.500]   Finished.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.180]   Right?
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.180]   Obvious question is like, "How?
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.180]   How do you do this?"
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.180]   Let's meditate.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.180]   Let's meditate.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.620]   Let's draw a picture of a heart in our head and just focus.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.620]   Really focus.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.700]   Love, love, love, love, love, love.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:56.300]   How much meditation do you need for your heart to be like, "Oh, I love that man."
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   Does that work?
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.980]   Does that ever work for you?
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.200]   Somebody wrong you or somebody who's difficult to love, you just go into your closet and
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.700]   memorize two verses like, "Oh, he said to love.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.700]   I forgot.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.700]   Sorry, I don't love."
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.700]   Okay.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:19.580]   The hardest thing to practice in our Christian faith is this very thing that he says.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.580]   If you don't have, it means nothing.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.420]   Even martyrdom doesn't mean nothing.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.340]   It doesn't mean anything if you don't have this.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.060]   So how do we have this?
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.060]   Right?
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:34.220]   I mean, nothing causes us to feel more helpless than to try to practice love with somebody
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.340]   that you don't want to love.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.620]   It drains us.
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.140]   It sucks the energy out of us.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.580]   I mean, it's miserable.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.940]   It feels good to take some vengeance sometimes.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.940]   It feels good.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.860]   It's like you're releasing some pressure.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.900]   Of course, we would never admit it, but our flesh feels good about it.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:02.260]   But you try to love somebody that is hard to love or maybe even deliberately trying
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:08.260]   to hurt you, it's not in us.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.420]   It's not in us.
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:18.820]   The best advice you'll get is keep your friends close and keep your enemies even closer, meaning
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.420]   keep your eye on them.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.220]   Keep your eye on them.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.860]   That's the wisdom of this world.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:33.220]   But to love them like the way he loved us while we're blaspheming, while we were yet
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:39.420]   sinners even as we confess our love, we so easily forget and are strayed.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.780]   To practice that love, that's not in us.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:49.380]   No amount of meditation, no amount of hard work, no amount of self-discipline is going
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.540]   to change your inner being and all of a sudden start to love people that are hard to love
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   by our flesh.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:47:01.060]   That's why the Bible says, when Paul says, "It is the love of Christ that compels
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.060]   me."
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:09.420]   It is only when his glory is restored that all we are doing is a reflection of his love.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:13.760]   Because you dig deep down inside, you're not going to find love.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.900]   You dig deep down, you discipline and you're like, "Resolved!
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.700]   I'm going to do this!"
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.820]   Deep inside you don't find that.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.980]   You find selfishness.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:29.100]   Anything that I need to do for me to survive, for me to have pleasure.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:35.100]   Sanctification is when we behold what he's done for us and it begins to reflect, reflection
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.220]   of his love.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:45.360]   So 1 Corinthians 13, as beautiful as this is, it isn't first and foremost, "You
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.380]   better do this."
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:54.260]   First and foremost is a description of his love for us.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.020]   His love for us.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:04.820]   So he wants us to behold his love and once we behold his love, once we are inspired by
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:10.280]   his love, once we are transformed by his love, then let that love reflect off of you.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.420]   Then the world will know that you are my disciples.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:19.760]   That you are near me, that you love me because you are doing only what you can do because
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.320]   you're my disciple.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:30.200]   So I want to read this text to you again, but I want you to read it not as a command
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.960]   for you to follow, even though obviously it is also a command, but I want you to see this
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.520]   as a description of God's perfect love for us.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.680]   So don't think about this is what I need to do.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.160]   Think about what he has done and I want to read this passage and I want you to reflect
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   upon this.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   Okay.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   Verse 4, "Love is patient.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:03.520]   Love is kind and is not jealous.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:09.560]   Love does not brag and it is not arrogant.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.120]   Does not act unbecomingly.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.440]   Does not seek its own.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.820]   Is not provoked.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.600]   Does not take into account of wrong suffered.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:32.520]   Does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.640]   Bears all things.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.960]   Believes all things.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.560]   Hopes all things.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.720]   Endures all things.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:51.680]   And love never fails."
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.920]   Think about every part of this verse.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.640]   He was patient with us.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.200]   He's kind toward us.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   He's not jealous.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.960]   He does not compete with us.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.960]   Does not brag.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.960]   He's not arrogant.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.460]   He's not unbecoming.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.980]   Not seeking his own, sacrificing for us.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:23.920]   Imagine if God was provoked every time we sin.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.040]   Does not take into account wrong suffered.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.900]   That once we repent, he forgives and he forgets.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.620]   Imagine if he didn't do that.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:40.060]   Does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with truth.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:45.780]   Think about all the things even to this day that he's bearing with us.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.380]   He believes all things.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.300]   Hopes all things.
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.140]   Endures all things.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.380]   And his love never fails.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.460]   He's calling us to reflect this in our lives.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.580]   Not to produce this in our lives, but to reflect this in our lives.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:12.020]   Verse 12, "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.740]   Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.680]   But now faith, hope, love abide, these three.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:25.440]   But the greatest of these is love."
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.620]   Do you love this Christ as he loves you?
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.140]   He loves you.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:38.620]   That's why when he said, "If you ask for forgiveness," he's faithful just to forgive you of all your
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:43.620]   unrighteousness because he is eager to forgive you.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.060]   He's not reluctant to forgive you.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.100]   He's eager to forgive you.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.020]   Why is he so eager to forgive us?
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.500]   Because he loves us.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:55.900]   Just like every parent is eager to forgive their children because they want that relationship
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.380]   to be restored.
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.180]   He's eager to forgive us.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.980]   That's why he tells us, "Come.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.040]   Come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.120]   Don't stiff arm him."
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.260]   Because that's the reason why he died for us, so that we would come.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.620]   "Come, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:18.420]   I will give you rest.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:23.220]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.660]   find rest for your souls."
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:30.540]   I pray that we would all, every single one of us, would find this rest in the love of
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540]   Christ.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:39.920]   Let's take some time to pray again as we ask our worship team to come.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.380]   Have you been drifting?
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:46.720]   Is your heart hardened?
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   Are you weary and heavy laden?
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.640]   When's the last time you really beheld this love?
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:59.800]   You know it intellectually, but when's the last time the glory of his love affected
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:05.000]   you so deeply that you desired that above everything else?
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.080]   That you're willing to suffer to have more of it?
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.720]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us this morning.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
