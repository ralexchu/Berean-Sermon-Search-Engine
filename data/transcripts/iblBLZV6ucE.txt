[00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:02.180]   - All right, good morning, church family.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.020]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.860]   Hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.220]   This morning, I'm gonna read from Psalm 100,
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.300]   verses four and five.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.660]   Enter his gates with thanksgiving
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.700]   and his courts with praise.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300]   Give thanks to him, bless his name.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.740]   For the Lord is good,
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.300]   his loving kindness is everlasting,
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.580]   and his faithfulness to all generations.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.860]   And with that, let us give thanks and bless the Lord.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.820]   (gentle music)

[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.660]   - All right, good morning
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.980]   and welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.260]   All right, let me get to a few announcements
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.100]   before we get started.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.340]   First of all, our FIG, Family in God Ministry.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.700]   This is, if you're not in the FAM 245,
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.060]   you're not in the Jubilee,
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.980]   they're taking a second round Bible reading fellowship
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.180]   that they're gonna be reading from Acts through Philippians.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.540]   And so if you're in it,
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.700]   you can re-sign up for the second portion of it.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.260]   If you're not in it, you can sign up
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.500]   and then they'll direct you
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.960]   to the right fellowship for that.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.620]   The Jubilee is also doing the same thing
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.100]   and I misannounced it on the first service.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.540]   They're doing the same thing except they're doing
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.260]   from Genesis to somewhere.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.660]   I forgot exactly where they're going,
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.040]   but starting at Genesis.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.640]   So if you are already signed up,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.980]   you can re-sign up for the second session
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.900]   or if you're not in it, you can sign up for it
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.020]   and Elder Philip will direct you to the right path for that.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.100]   All the other stuff, I'm just gonna let you
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.100]   look it up online, but I was told
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.100]   that our auction was able to raise 28,000 plus
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.680]   for our summer mission.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.660]   So we're very thankful for your generosity,
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.340]   for those of you who've donated your gifts
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.820]   and various things and those of you
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.940]   who overbid for some of these things.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.580]   And we know why you did it.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.500]   It was obviously you were trying to give to the funds
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.900]   and it was a creative way to do that.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.300]   And then this is one of those things
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.900]   that I'm so thankful that got started a few years ago.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.500]   Our sister Rachel and Andy kind of introduced it
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.160]   to the church and not only are you raising funds,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.060]   you're serving the church and the church
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.140]   is able to fellowship through it.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.540]   You get to go over to people's houses
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.580]   and enjoy meals together.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.260]   So it's just a win, win, win, win, win situation
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.100]   for everybody.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.660]   So thank you very much and just wanted
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.780]   to give you information that we were told
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.940]   that that's what they raised.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.860]   This morning, I'm gonna take some time.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.020]   We'll pray and then give you an opportunity to give.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.660]   Again, if you're gonna give online,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.300]   please give through Subsplash.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.380]   If not, we have a physical offering box in the back.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.340]   Then after our praise time, our brother Aaron Tong
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.740]   is gonna come up, give his testimony
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.020]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.140]   All right, let's pray.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:33.460]   Father, we thank you so much for your grace
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.360]   that sustains us, that empowers us,
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.960]   that causes us, Lord God, to persevere and to look to you.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.980]   Help us, Lord God, that in our weakness
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.100]   that you would cause us to lift up our eyes
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.700]   to recognize the true King,
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.220]   the only one worthy of all our full attention.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.020]   Help us, Lord, to run to Christ as our refuge,
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.300]   to cling to him, Lord God, for our sustenance
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.040]   and to look to him as the object of our worship.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.740]   I pray that the offering that we give
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.900]   would be an extension of this worship
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.780]   and may it be handled with wisdom and biblically
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.140]   that it may be multiplied for the sake of your glory
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.220]   and your kingdom.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.280]   (gentle music)
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.700]   (gentle music continues)

[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:58.460]   Would you rise and take a minute
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.900]   to greet those around you
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.680]   and we will continue our worship.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.260]   (gentle music)
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:24.300]   (upbeat music)

[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:58.340]   - Hello, okay.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.380]   Good morning, church family.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.860]   My name is Aaron Tong.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.300]   I was raised in a God-fearing family of five,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.220]   going to church on Sundays and youth group on Wednesdays.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.620]   I was a very defiant, stubborn, and disobedient child
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.700]   who wanted to control everything.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.340]   Whenever my mom would spank me for my treason,
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.260]   she would pray for my repentance and my salvation
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.460]   in hopes that I'd receive the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.140]   who'd be her ally in raising me.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.660]   I professed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.620]   when I was just six years old.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.500]   At the time, I knew that I was a sinner
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.140]   and that Jesus was the only one
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.100]   who could save me from my sins.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.660]   However, I didn't know the cross's implications on my life
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.780]   besides being a ticket to heaven and an escape from hell.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.820]   In 2012, our family moved from Texas to Arkansas,
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.240]   where I switched schools and ended up at a new church.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.760]   I continued to attend youth group
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.600]   and to do all of the things a Christian would do.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.900]   I was a pretty good kid.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.540]   I got good grades, parents and teachers liked me,
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.620]   and I stayed out of trouble.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.680]   Simultaneously, though, I started to grow up.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.620]   I couldn't help but notice that the world
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.460]   had a lot to offer, popularity, money,
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.100]   entertainment, and sexual pleasures.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.660]   I couldn't help but wonder why God would tell me
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.820]   not to love the world.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.300]   Didn't he create the world?
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.340]   Christianity became this big rule book,
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.100]   and I only felt constrained by its demands and teachings.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.460]   By the time I entered high school,
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.580]   my life was indistinguishable from unbelievers.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.420]   Away from my parents, I cursed, gossiped about others,
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.960]   and was deep in sexual sin.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.580]   Because of the pandemic, but more so my selfishness,
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.340]   I stopped going to church for a long period of time
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.680]   and became disconnected from my youth group.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.340]   My friends would ask about Christianity's
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.180]   strict rules and practices, and I would cop out
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.740]   by calling my faith just a personal relationship,
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.180]   not a religion, completely ignoring the call
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.140]   to take up my cross and pursue holiness.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.260]   I tried to run to forgiveness and grace without repentance.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.380]   In high school, I also chased excellence
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.300]   in athletics and academics, putting my identity
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.040]   in championship rings, GPA, and follower counts.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.300]   Whenever I would pray, it was just to be heard
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.980]   and to build my own kingdom, not to listen to God's will.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.340]   I would cheesily say I can do all things
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.920]   through Christ who strengthens me before races and tests.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.540]   I tried to be the God of my life
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.900]   and thought that God existed to serve me.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.860]   By God's grace, I was forced to move across the country
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.860]   to California during my junior year of high school.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.420]   With my whole life uprooted right before my prime years
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.740]   of high school, I suddenly became the new kid.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.940]   Having been raised in the South, I was a banana
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.260]   and didn't fit in with all the Asian kids.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.380]   I made it my mission to just get good grades
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.000]   and get into a good college.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.460]   I didn't feel like making new friends
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.140]   and starting over again.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.580]   I wallowed in self-pity, licking my wounds,
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.180]   and using the pain as motivation
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.820]   to beat everyone else in college admissions.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.780]   I thought that if I just dug deep
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.460]   and maximized my potential by grinding,
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.500]   that I'd somehow find fulfillment.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.900]   When senior year rolled around,
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.620]   I realized having no friends meant that I had no friends
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.780]   to go to prom or grad bash with.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.700]   To solve this problem, I started to show up
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.580]   to our school's Christian club.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.640]   Despite my selfish motivations,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.860]   God used my time there to magnify who he was.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.220]   The friends I made there actually lived out their faith,
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.820]   and I was deeply intrigued by their love for me,
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.820]   a complete stranger.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.980]   During March, college decisions came out.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.740]   I had been wait-listed or rejected
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.620]   from every single dream school I had applied to.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.340]   This spanking from God hurt far more than my mom's hand.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.460]   My whole life felt like a failure
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.480]   because I thought everything revolved around my will.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.220]   I was bitter and jealous of my peers.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.780]   This last straw took me to a dark place,
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.580]   the lowest of lows, where God allowed me
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.860]   to feel the weight of my sin and brokenness.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.100]   Though I thought my lust, my pride, and my selfishness
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.060]   would fill me, they left me empty.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.740]   I had exchanged the glory of the creator for created things
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.600]   and was on the broad road to destruction.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.860]   Over the summer, I was blessed to hang out
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.520]   a lot with my friends that I had made
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.160]   from the Christian club.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.740]   Their encouragement led me to believe
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.180]   that there was something far greater
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.480]   than myself in this world.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.860]   One day, as I was scrolling Instagram reels,
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.380]   I saw a reel that said I could find
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.120]   the meaning of life in Ecclesiastes.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.300]   For the first time in years, I decided to open my Bible.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.100]   Ecclesiastes punctured my heart and heart
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.980]   and made me realize that my whole life was vanity.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.180]   There is nothing under the sun that would ever be enough,
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.000]   but everything God does will endure forever.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.640]   I started to understand that my concept of God
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.740]   had been flipped my whole life.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.640]   Everything exists for his glory,
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.500]   not my laughable greatness.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.740]   As I've been at Berean, God has graciously
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.580]   allowed me to repent and place my faith in Christ.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.820]   I've learned that loving the Lord with all my heart
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.720]   means all my heart and not 50%.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.020]   If I try to love God and love this world,
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.060]   I'll surely lose both.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   I've learned the commands he's given aren't constraints,
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.900]   they're ways I get to delight in the freedom
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.020]   Christ has given me from sin.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.580]   I've learned that I can do all things
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.140]   through Christ who strengthens me.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.200]   Doesn't mean I can have and do whatever I want.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.180]   More so, it means there's going to be
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.480]   a lot of suffering, pain, and tears,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:48.100]   but Jesus will be right there with me in my weakness.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:53.180]   To this day, I struggle to grasp that a holy God
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.100]   loves such a miserable wretch like me
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.960]   and sent his only son to take my place on that cross.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:05.500]   John 14, six reads, Jesus answered,
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.160]   I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.020]   No one comes to the Father except through me.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.180]   Eternal life was never about getting to go
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.560]   to an all-inclusive resort on a cloud
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.700]   or having a perfect, comfortable life on earth.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.420]   Eternal life is knowing Christ
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.660]   and giving up all that I am for all that he is.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.660]   Revelations 21, four says,
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.260]   he will wipe away every tear from their eyes
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.200]   and there will no longer be any death.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.580]   There will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.280]   The first things have passed away.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.580]   I long for that day more than anything else,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.340]   but until then, I will joyfully serve my Father.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.620]   Thank you.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.620]   (audience applauds)
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.620]   (audience applauds)
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:28:08.820]   - Aaron, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.540]   you're being united to Christ's death?
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.380]   When you're coming out,
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.520]   you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.360]   - I do.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.300]   - I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.240]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.620]   (water splashes)
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.620]   (audience applauds)
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:35.360]   - All right, thank you, Aaron,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.200]   for that very encouraging testimony.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter eight,
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.420]   and I wanna read starting from verse four
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.120]   all the way down to verse 15, okay?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.680]   Luke chapter eight, verse four,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.580]   all the way down to verse 15.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.720]   Reading out of the NASB, it says,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.280]   now, sorry, when a large crowd was coming together,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.240]   and those from the various cities were journeying to him,
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.800]   he spoke by way of a parable.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.920]   The sower went out to sow his seed,
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.120]   and as he sowed, some fell beside the road,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.560]   and it was trampled underfoot,
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   and the birds of the air ate it up.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.120]   Other seeds fell on rocky soil,
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   and as soon as it grew up, it withered away,
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.960]   because it had no moisture.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.680]   Other seeds fell among the thorns,
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.360]   and the thorns grew up with it, and choked it out.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.240]   Other seeds fell into the good soil,
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.140]   and grew up and produced a crop a hundred times as great.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.600]   As he said these things, he would call out,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.180]   he who has ears to hear, let him hear.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.720]   His disciples began questioning him
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.520]   as to what this parable meant.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.560]   And he said, to you it has been granted
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.520]   to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.760]   but to the rest, it is in parables,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.280]   so that seeing they may not see,
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.520]   and hearing they may not understand.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.000]   Now the parable is this.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.360]   The seed is the word of God.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.720]   Those beside the road are those who have heard.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.520]   Then the devil comes and takes away the word
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.960]   from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.760]   Those on the rocky soil are those who,
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.000]   when they hear, receive the word with joy,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.720]   and these have no firm root.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.880]   They believe for a while,
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.240]   and in time of temptation, fall away.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.280]   The seed which fell among the thorns,
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.240]   these are the ones who have heard,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.200]   and as they go on their way, they are choked
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.720]   with worries and riches and pleasures of this life,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.920]   and bring no fruit to maturity.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.480]   For the seed and the good soil,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.600]   these are the ones who have heard the word
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.880]   in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast,
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.000]   and bear fruit with perseverance.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.840]   Let's pray.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:35.040]   Father, we pray for understanding,
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.960]   not simply the words, but your very heart.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   We ask, Lord God, that your very breath
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.760]   would cause us, Lord, to know you,
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.960]   to love you, and to worship you.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.440]   Help us not to stray from your word
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.520]   to the left or to the right.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.520]   Years ago, when I was a young Christian,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.240]   when I first became a Christian,
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.520]   one of the faith crisis that I had early on
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.800]   was I talked to a Jehovah Witness
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.600]   that I really looked up to,
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.400]   not knowing he was a Jehovah Witness,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.280]   and after the conversation, it really shook me,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.560]   because if you asked me at that time
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.280]   who I thought was the strongest Christian,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.080]   I would have said it was that guy.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.280]   He was a coworker of my dad at some company,
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.200]   and after that encounter, and again,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.760]   this was just a few months after I became a Christian,
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   I began to wonder, how do I know
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.900]   if what I am believing is right?
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.160]   What if the Bible he's reading is right,
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.200]   and what about the Mormons,
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.800]   and what about the Jehovah Witnesses,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.720]   and what about the Muslims and the Buddhists,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.440]   and how can I be sure?
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.780]   So I started questioning.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.100]   I believe God, but which path was the right way?
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.620]   Am I professing to be a believer in a Protestant faith
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.820]   because I was born in a pastor's family,
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.220]   and I just happened to be in a Christian environment,
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.800]   and that's the environment that I ended up meeting God,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.160]   and so therefore I just assumed
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.280]   that this was the right way,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.040]   and so I started questioning.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.080]   I started to ask, and the conclusion that I came to
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.920]   is the reliability of God's word.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.960]   Is the Bible that they're using their authority?
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.040]   Is that more reliable than what I had?
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.020]   And so I began to try to study.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.280]   When I, in college, I started taking classes
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.160]   on world religion and its origin and where it came from,
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.760]   and I started soaking up as much as I can,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.380]   and every opportunity I had,
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.160]   whether it was a Buddhist or a Mormon or Jehovah Witness,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.080]   I would sit and ask.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.440]   Instead of trying to evangelize to them,
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.560]   I would ask them, where did it come from?
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.380]   How did it start?
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.220]   Who is this guy?
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.720]   What was the evidence behind it?
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.120]   And my end conclusion was
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.460]   this is the word of God, without a doubt,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.460]   and my faith in this word is much stronger today
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.640]   than it was when I first started,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.560]   but the beginning of that was I came to believe
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.400]   with all my heart this is God's word.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.580]   The parable that we're looking at,
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.280]   Jesus says, for the purpose of warning his disciples,
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.080]   because the crowds are growing bigger and bigger,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.600]   and so he's warning them that not everybody
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.560]   who's coming to me are genuine believers,
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.920]   and so there's gonna come a time
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.680]   when Jesus is gonna say something
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.240]   that's gonna disturb them,
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.960]   and many are going to walk away,
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.120]   so he's telling them that some of them
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.080]   are coming for this reason,
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.360]   some of them are gonna look like they're believers,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.720]   they're gonna fall away,
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.600]   and some of them are gonna be among us,
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.360]   and then they're gonna fall away,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.640]   and he makes it very clear,
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.600]   the only one who's a true Christian is the fourth soil,
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.520]   the one who perseveres,
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.560]   and the Bible repeats that over and over and over again,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.600]   and the agent in which,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.520]   an agent in which that identifies
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.440]   if somebody's a true believer or not is the word of God.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.080]   The seed, clearly, he says, is the word of God.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.520]   So you can profess that this is the word of God,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.640]   but does it have authority over your life?
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.240]   You can say you believe in an inerrant word of God,
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.520]   but when the word of God is open,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.720]   does it change you?
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.060]   I'm not talking about my sermon,
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.580]   whether you like the sermon or not.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.980]   I'm talking about when the word of God is open,
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.060]   and it judges the thoughts and intentions of your heart,
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.820]   how do you respond?
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.480]   We have a tendency when,
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.280]   especially if you've been a Christian for a while,
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.200]   or at the church for a while,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.060]   you kind of give a thumbs up or thumbs down on sermon,
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.340]   and after this service,
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.220]   people are gonna ask you, how was the sermon today?
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.380]   I liked it, or I didn't like it.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.940]   Thumbs up, thumbs down.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.280]   Now, there's nothing wrong with that in and of itself.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.940]   Everybody has preferences in how it touched you
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.160]   or didn't touch you,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.260]   but if that's where it stops,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.840]   the word of God has no authority.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.240]   The real question that we need to be asking is,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.700]   was it truthful?
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.380]   Was it biblical?
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.980]   And if it was biblical,
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.100]   if it was biblical, what does that mean to you?
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.340]   How is that gonna change you?
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.580]   But if the hearing of the word of God stops
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.060]   with I liked it and I didn't like it,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.780]   that's the same question that Paul says
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.020]   there's gonna come a time when people are gonna gather
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.740]   teachers to tickle their ears.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.260]   So people who are coming to get their ears tickled,
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.260]   the only question that they ask is,
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.780]   did I like it, did I not like it?
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.060]   And there's no difference between a genuine believer
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:30.480]   and an unbeliever if that's the only question you ask.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.440]   Did I like it or not like it?
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.000]   In Hebrews chapter two one it says,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.440]   for this reason we must pay much closer attention
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.900]   to what we have heard so that we do not drift away from it.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.980]   We must pay close attention to God's word.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.640]   Not just hear it, but what does it mean to you?
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.040]   How has the word of God shaped the way you think?
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.640]   How has the word of God shaped the way you live?
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.760]   How has the word of God shaped the way you see money?
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.080]   Raising your children, your future, your goal?
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.400]   Again, the four soils is given so that he would prepare
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.400]   his disciples for the inevitable fallout of the crowds.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.600]   He's also warning the crowds that are coming
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   that not all of you are coming to me for the right reason.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.520]   And so when the fallout does happen,
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.560]   which we know it happens in multiple stages,
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.160]   that they will remember Jesus said,
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.120]   not all who hear the word of God
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.160]   and seem to respond are genuine believers.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   So this morning I want to look at the two soils
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.200]   and then the third and fourth we'll look at next week.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.860]   I want to spend a little bit more time,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.760]   I preach through this so many times in our church,
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.480]   but I want to take some time to comb through
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.820]   what this actually looks like in the context
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.920]   of a post-Christian society.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.360]   Clearly, the identifying mark of a Christian is the fruit.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.800]   The Bible says you will know them by their fruit,
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.640]   not by their confession, but by their fruit.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.540]   First John, it says they left us
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.880]   because they were never really of us.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.020]   They left us and proved that them falling away
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.360]   revealed whether their faith was genuine or not.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.020]   That's what it says in First John.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.640]   It says in John 15, those who do not bear fruit,
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.160]   they will dry up and be thrown into the fire.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.020]   The Bible tells us over and over again
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.760]   the true identifying mark of genuine faith is their fruit.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:42.020]   Again, the only believer in these four soils
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.320]   is the fourth soil.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.220]   So I want to look at the first two soils
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.420]   and what that looks like in the context of the church.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   First, the seed that fell on the side of the road.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.620]   These are unbelievers who heard the gospel,
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.020]   maybe in the context of a church.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.860]   Maybe it's in the context of somebody else
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.780]   sharing the gospel and you just happen to overhear it.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.540]   In a post-Christian church, we have a lot of that
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.780]   where people who grew up in the church
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.220]   were never really believers.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.180]   So you are cultured as Christians, but you're not Christians.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.180]   So if you took a survey in the United States
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.980]   and asked people how many of you identify as Christians,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.380]   and I remember back in the '80s and early '90s,
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.660]   it was as high as 80-some percent.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.500]   Now, we know for a fact that's not true.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.720]   But over 80% at least identified as Christians.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.380]   Many of them, I would say most of them,
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.780]   probably fall into this category.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.860]   They heard, they never really believed,
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.960]   but they're cultured.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.140]   In fact, before I met Christ,
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.380]   because I was raised in the church,
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.780]   my dad's a pastor, my grandfather's a pastor.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.700]   Church was part of our life.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.380]   If somebody asked me, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.380]   I would've said, "Yes."
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.260]   What else would I be?
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.980]   My dad's a pastor, what else would I be?
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.140]   I go to church, what else would I be?
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.820]   But I was not a Christian.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.260]   But I would've told you I was a Christian.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.860]   If you asked me, "Do I believe in God?"
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.220]   Of course I believe in God.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.240]   I don't know what that meant.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.900]   I was living in sin.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.940]   I had no loyalty to Him.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.140]   I never prayed.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.340]   But if you asked me, I would've said, "Yes."
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.860]   So in a post-Christian culture,
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.580]   many of these people, where you've heard
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.380]   and it makes no impact, at least go to church.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.780]   Now, if you're not in the church
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.060]   and you're denying and say, "That's a bunch of foolishness."
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.720]   That's easy to identify.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.820]   But in a post-Christian church, they're inside the church.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.020]   In 1 Corinthians 2:14, "But a natural man
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.740]   "does not accept the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.460]   "for they are foolishness to him,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.200]   "and he cannot understand them
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.000]   "because they are spiritually appraised."
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.640]   He said, "Every genuine believer
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.820]   "has the Holy Spirit in him,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.000]   "but because the Holy Spirit is not in him,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.380]   "they are not able to discern.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.300]   "Is this right or is this wrong?"
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.720]   So they are unbelievers.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.700]   These are people who are committed to the church
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.720]   purely for social reasons.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.140]   You wanna play basketball.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.500]   You have young people your age.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.260]   You're looking for a wife or a girlfriend.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.380]   And we have people who are just honest, right?
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.060]   Now that our church is a certain size,
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.720]   we have people just bold and they say, "Why are you here?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.560]   "What are you looking for?"
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.380]   It's, "I'm looking for a wife."
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.920]   Okay, and then we have to tell people,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.960]   "Hey, watch out for that guy.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.020]   "We gotta protect our girls," right?
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.280]   But after a while, for social reasons,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.740]   these are people who have no interest in God
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.900]   and they're more than welcome to come and learn.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.240]   But the problem that we get into
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.620]   in a post-Christian culture
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.620]   where a good church and a bad church,
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.820]   a successful church and an unsuccessful church
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.920]   is measured by the number,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.220]   then we have to gather as many people
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.100]   to the church as possible,
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.820]   even the people who are outright rejecting Christ.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.340]   You're welcome to come to church.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.380]   And the problem is, when you come to church,
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.160]   you can easily become a member.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.380]   And when you become a member of the church,
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.220]   you serve the church.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.860]   And if you serve the church, you can become a leader.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.620]   And so the church has become a place
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.500]   where we can't tell the difference
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   between the world and the church.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   In Matthew 10, 14, it says,
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.360]   "Whoever does not receive you nor heed your words
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.340]   "as you go out of the house or that city,
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.740]   "shake the dust off your feet."
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.720]   Now you may read that and say,
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.160]   "We can't practice that, shake the dust."
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.500]   So we apply.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.580]   And I don't know if you've ever said this
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.220]   or you've heard this.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.940]   Didn't Jesus say that he would leave the 99
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.800]   to go after the one, right?
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:59.000]   That parable has been so misunderstood and misapplied
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.600]   and in some sense have ruined the church.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   Now think about it.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.820]   Does Jesus mean that that one sheep
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.180]   is much more precious than the 99?
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.820]   So abandon the 99.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.460]   No matter what that one does,
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.220]   abandon the 99 to go after one.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.040]   Does that make sense?
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.380]   Is that what Jesus is saying?
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.940]   That even if that one is ruining the church,
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.140]   leave the 99.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.220]   If you have 10 children and one strays,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.780]   you're gonna abandon the nine because of the one?
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.260]   Is that what Jesus is saying?
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.160]   So much of the dilution in the church,
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.920]   the compromise in the church has been given
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.480]   because of the wrong understanding of this.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.800]   The point that Jesus was making
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.360]   was that every soul is precious before God.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.560]   Every soul is precious.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.320]   He's not saying you compromise the 99.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.480]   I remember, and I may have shared this before,
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.800]   years ago I went to a youth retreat to speak
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:04.460]   and one of the teachers was beating up on the kid,
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.380]   junior high school kid.
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.220]   And then so we had to have a meeting,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.540]   and I was a guest speaker there
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.900]   and I was part of the meeting and saying,
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.660]   I found out that there was a pattern of this,
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.340]   that this guy had such a bad temper
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.500]   and anybody he felt disrespected, he would beat them up.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.700]   And so we had to scold the teacher.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.740]   And I remember talking to the youth pastor
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.820]   who was a friend of mine and said,
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.460]   "Why do you allow that guy to come?"
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.880]   And he said, "If we don't let him come,
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.500]   "he won't come to church."
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.860]   And I remember just shaking my head and said,
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.600]   "Would you do that if that was your kid?
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.820]   "If that was your child, so that he can come to church,
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.500]   "you're gonna let him have access to kids?
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.260]   "Imagine what happens to that kid because of that guy."
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.320]   But he said, "Didn't Jesus say
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.000]   "he's gonna leave the 99 to go after the one?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.360]   "I'm going after the one."
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.000]   He's saying every soul is precious before God.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.560]   And here's the kicker.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   He said he's going after his sheep, not any sheep.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.320]   He's not going after someone else's sheep.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.720]   He's going after his sheep, like his children.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.880]   And each one of them, every single one of them,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.960]   is precious before God.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.420]   The problem that we have come into in our generation
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.080]   is that we think drawing lines is unbiblical.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.920]   Read the scriptures.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.520]   Jesus here is drawing the line.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.840]   Here's people who have heard it.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.920]   They received the word of God.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.760]   They have outright rejected it.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:41.040]   And so therefore, they are not part of the body of Christ.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.560]   One of the things that I hear a lot is,
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.320]   Pastor Peter, we have a church where the Bible is taught,
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.180]   and if I bring my non-Christian friend,
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.220]   they may not understand your preaching.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.400]   So they're kind of requesting
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.640]   that I would bring the sermon down a little bit, right?
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.240]   Now let me make this very clear.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.320]   We are here gathered for worship, right?
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.280]   So the target of my sermon are Christians,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.320]   so that his sheep may be fed.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.120]   So are non-Christians welcome?
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.360]   Of course they're welcome.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.680]   They're more than welcome to come ask questions
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.480]   so that we can share the gospel with them.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.640]   But this is worship.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.680]   Non-Christians cannot worship God.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.760]   My target is not non-Christians
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.960]   when I stand here on Sunday morning.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.380]   They're more than welcome.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.920]   We hope that you will evangelize.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.320]   We hope that you would share the gospel with them.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.200]   We hope that you would share the love of Christ with them.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.160]   But we are gathered here for the purpose of worship
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.780]   so that you may be fed.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:48.240]   This is the body of Christ.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.800]   Non-Christians are not part of the body of Christ.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.840]   We want to present the body.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.400]   We want the body of Christ to be the light to them,
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   but they are not part of the body of Christ.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.120]   Now, the first soil is easy
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.960]   because the first soil people have heard the word of God
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.640]   and openly said I'm not a Christian.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.760]   I don't believe this.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.160]   So these are things that have fallen on the side.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:14.240]   So either they have heard it outside or heard it inside,
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.040]   but they never, there's no confusion here.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.480]   Where the confusion begins is the second and the third.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   So if you're offended by the second soil, hold on, right?
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.640]   Because we're gonna get to the third soil next week
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.000]   and you're really gonna be bothered by it, okay?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.120]   Second soil is the one that falls on the rocky soil.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.200]   They respond with joy, but because they have no roots,
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.920]   they eventually die.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.840]   So the first thing that it says is they respond with joy.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.000]   So they look like everybody else.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.240]   So because they responded with enthusiasm,
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.040]   they make a decision and so some of them
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.600]   may even be baptized, may even become members of the church,
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.240]   but they say that eventually when they are tested
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.200]   and temptation come, they fold and they walk away.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.560]   So their faith wasn't genuine,
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.160]   but initially it says they responded with joy.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:16.120]   Now, again, in a post-Christian culture,
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.000]   when somebody raised their hands,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.360]   we say, well, one saved, always saved.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.560]   Years ago, Billy Graham contacted Dawson Trotman,
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.240]   who was the leader of the Navigators,
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.280]   and Navigators was known for strict discipleship, right?
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.560]   And so Billy Graham contacted Dawson Trotman
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.880]   because he was starting to hear of the study
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.040]   of the people who make a decision for Christ
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.480]   and they would ask people to come and make a decision,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.520]   raise their hand, come down,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.920]   and they would do the sinner's prayer and they would go.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   But the studies found out that 97%
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.760]   of the people who make the decision
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.440]   never end up going to church.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:02.760]   So initially they said only 6% who make a decision,
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.440]   they come down this aisle, only 6% end up going to church,
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.520]   and out of the 6%, more than half of them
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.800]   end up leaving the church and only,
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.000]   so 3% of all the people who come down.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Now, that study was done years ago
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.480]   and then they did a recent study of the Harvest Crusade.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.800]   And this has nothing to do with like,
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.040]   oh, the Harvest Crusade is bad,
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.440]   or it has nothing to do with that, it's just facts.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.960]   It's for all the people who come
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.360]   and make a decision for Jesus,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.880]   only 3% are walking with Christ.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   Now, the problem with that is that 95, 7% of them
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.120]   will walk away and say, one saved, always saved.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.800]   I raised my hand, I went down.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.000]   I got a free Bible.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.440]   But the word of God is not going into them.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.560]   They don't know what it means to be a follower of Christ.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.660]   And maybe their faith isn't real, we don't know.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:01.760]   Because the gospel in and of itself is taught
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.560]   so that the maximum number of people can come in
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.000]   to the church, the maximum number.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.200]   If the gospel that you hear is,
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.680]   Jesus loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life,
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.040]   and your hardship comes because you're separated from God,
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.440]   and he forgives us unconditionally.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.240]   He loves you unconditionally.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.360]   He receives you unconditionally.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.640]   And so you live your life.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.440]   Yeah, we may struggle, but thank God it is by grace.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.200]   And so when you die, you're gonna go to heaven.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.720]   And then you've given that, like, who wouldn't want this?
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.800]   What have you got to lose?
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.880]   Raise your hand and come down and get a free Bible.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.000]   And then they walk away,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.880]   and you have a generation filled with people
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.760]   who are absolutely convinced that when they die,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.320]   that they're gonna be in heaven,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.440]   not knowing the warnings of scripture.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.000]   He says they have no roots.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Roots is underneath the ground, so you can't see it.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.160]   So when somebody receives with joy, we don't know.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:03.960]   But the root is what's connected to the nutrients,
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.240]   to the water, the living water.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   And so when the sun shines, when the temptation comes,
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.960]   what was meant to sustain them withers them.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.580]   In James chapter one, two to four, it says,
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.700]   consider all joy, my brethren,
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.060]   when you encounter various trials,
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.900]   knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.700]   And let endurance have its perfect results
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.620]   so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.820]   See, for a believer,
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.280]   when the testing and the trials come in,
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.300]   it strengthens their faith.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.800]   It tests their faith through,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.260]   and they're almost like there's a greater resolve.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.900]   You grow in your faith as your faith is tested.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.100]   You learn to persevere, and eventually, you are perfected.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.780]   You are sanctified because of trials and difficulty.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.980]   But an unbeliever who may, on the surface, look the same,
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.420]   an exact same trial comes into their life,
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.740]   and they completely wither.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.740]   Why did God do this to me?
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.820]   Why did they do this to me?
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.940]   And they don't see,
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.160]   because what's precious to them is not Christ.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.460]   What's precious to them is this world,
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.820]   and Christ is only the avenue to get there,
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.500]   and when that is taken away,
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.460]   it is enough reason for them to walk away from their faith.
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.500]   That's what the second soil looks like.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.700]   They have added the church without adding Christ.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.100]   In a post-Christian culture,
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.620]   there's all kinds of reasons to come to Christ,
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.540]   'cause we don't have community.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.540]   So you come to church and look for people who are like you.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.260]   You go to church,
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.860]   and there's other people raising children like you.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:47.060]   You go to church and looking for purpose, community.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.960]   So everything that you want as a social human being,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.100]   you don't have it in the world,
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.140]   so you find it in the church.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.060]   You get to play softball with people.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.440]   You get to play BBA, right?
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.860]   Maybe find your future girlfriend, your wife.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.180]   You raise your kids, teaching good morals.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.820]   You have all kinds of reasons to come to church
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.860]   without actually knowing Christ.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.300]   2 Timothy 3, one through five, he said,
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.940]   "But realize this, that in the last days,
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.820]   "difficult times will come."
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.840]   In verse five, "They are holding to a form of godliness,
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.780]   "although they have denied its power.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.900]   "Avoid such men as these."
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.100]   Holding to a form of godliness,
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.980]   meaning that this is a group of people
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.500]   who have learned to play the game.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.580]   They know what to say.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.840]   They know how to behave.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.380]   They know what to do,
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.500]   because they've been in the church
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:39.560]   and they've been educated,
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.500]   so they know how to play the game,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.660]   but the affection for Christ never grows
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.220]   because the root is not connected to the living water.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.400]   So they hear it, they're learning,
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.420]   but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.580]   just like it's in 2 Timothy 3, seven.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.480]   Always learning, never able to come
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.840]   to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.260]   Always learning, always hearing,
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.100]   always adding more knowledge.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.380]   And if you've been in the church long enough,
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.100]   you know how to, you know how to behave.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.380]   You know how to serve.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.640]   You know how to talk to people.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.100]   You know how to get the attention of the leaders.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:21.100]   You learn to play the game, and you play it well,
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.740]   but you've never really repented.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:29.540]   You're holding on to your old life,
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.540]   because you see Christ as a conduit to get what you want.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:40.100]   In order to accommodate the unbelieving and the uncommitted,
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.060]   the church has created a culture
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.900]   that looks no different than the world.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.460]   We want the uncommitted, unconverted,
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.500]   people with no roots,
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.620]   who have spiritually walked away from their faith,
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.360]   to feel comfortable at church,
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.540]   week after week, year after year,
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.140]   and no wonder the church doesn't look
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.100]   any different than the world.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.260]   And so every once in a while,
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.420]   we hear statistics of sexual sin,
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.940]   about divorce, about all kinds of things
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.980]   that the church does and says,
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.660]   "Well, Christians are no different."
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.400]   But I realize that these statistics
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.040]   are not about Christians.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.260]   They're about the church, about professing Christians.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.160]   In 1 Corinthians 3, 16, and 17, it said,
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.320]   "Do you not know that you are a temple of God,
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.940]   "and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:28.660]   "If any man destroys the temple of God,
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:29.580]   "God will destroy him,
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.200]   "for the temple of God is holy,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.780]   "and that is what you are."
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.140]   Paul is writing to the Corinthians,
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.320]   because all kinds of chaos is coming into the church.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.900]   Because the leaders were hungry for power,
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.940]   and they were one-upping each other,
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.360]   it caused divisions in the church,
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.120]   and they allowed all kinds of sins
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.960]   to enter into the church.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.320]   The worship was in chaos,
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.440]   the spiritual gifts were in chaos,
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.040]   the communion table was in chaos.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.960]   And he said, "Do you not know that your assembly,
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.620]   "your gathering, is a temple of God?"
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.660]   Every Jew knew exactly what he meant.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:07.940]   If you enter the temple of God with blasphemous thoughts,
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.840]   you're asking for judgment.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:18.080]   The high priest couldn't linger in the Holy of Holies.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.020]   Just by lingering beyond what he should have been, he died.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.020]   So when he said, "Do you not know that your body,
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.580]   "your church, is a temple of God?"
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.580]   They knew exactly what he meant.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:32.420]   He was saying, "Hey, stop acting like the world.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.320]   "Recognize what the church is."
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.520]   In Jude 4, it says,
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.580]   "For certain persons have crept in unnoticed,
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.040]   "those who were long beforehand
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.600]   "marked out for this condemnation,
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.160]   "ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   "into licentiousness and deny our only master
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.260]   "and Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.500]   It says, "They have crept in."
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.980]   Sad thing about our generation, they did not creep in.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.820]   We opened the door wide open and put a sign out saying,
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.600]   "Everyone is welcome."
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.300]   Of course, they're welcome to come to church
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.660]   'cause we want to share the gospel with you.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:08.200]   Of course, they're welcome to come and ask questions.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.160]   We have events so that non-Christian can come
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.220]   so we can share the gospel with them.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.260]   But the problem is,
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:17.140]   unbelievers have been welcomed in the church,
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.500]   serving in the church, have become members in the church,
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.680]   and oftentimes, even become leaders in the church.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.260]   This is the temple of God.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.520]   And then he says in Jude chapter, verse 12,
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:32.100]   "These are men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts,
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.960]   "in your fellowship, when they feast with you,
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.460]   "without fear, caring for themselves,
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.560]   "clouds without water, carried along by winds,
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:43.220]   "autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted."
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.460]   These are people who have a memory
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.980]   of what they were like when they were young.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.620]   When Christianity was manufactured
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.260]   in their college ministry,
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.020]   where they were constantly surrounded
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.300]   by constant encouragement,
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.660]   and you were almost peer-pressured to be a Christian.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.940]   And so you went to camp, you went to small group,
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.180]   you participated because all your friends did it,
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.100]   and so the only time you remember
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.080]   when you were in love with Christ
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.100]   was when Christianity was manufactured for you
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:18.660]   to pressure you to live like a Christian.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.300]   But those are many years behind.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.180]   You physically didn't walk away from Christ,
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.740]   but in every other aspect, outside of what you say,
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.020]   no one would know the difference.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:38.340]   He says, "They are reefs in your feasts,
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:40.180]   "in your fellowship."
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.100]   In the church, we have the universal church,
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.980]   which is unseen.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.740]   And the membership of the universal church
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.620]   is the Holy Spirit.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:52.620]   And so the Holy Spirit doesn't make mistakes.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.980]   Nobody comes into the universal church by accident,
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.020]   by acting a certain way,
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.780]   'cause the Holy Spirit will know.
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.580]   The local church is the expression
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.540]   of that universal church in the local body.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:09.020]   But in the local church, we make mistakes.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.520]   'Cause oftentimes, we can't tell.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.960]   'Cause the roots, sometimes you can't tell.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.800]   It takes time.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.380]   We have to see the fruit.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.460]   That's why Jesus says to be careful
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.380]   that we uproot the wheat with the tares,
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.140]   because they look the same until time passes
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.220]   and you can see the fruit.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.740]   So in the local church, we have mixtures.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.340]   So it's one thing to make a mistake.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:34.100]   It's another thing to defile the church deliberately.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.500]   There is no fellowship.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:42.100]   There is no fellowship in the church
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.700]   who are not part of the universal church.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.520]   There is no fellowship.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.780]   There can't be fellowship,
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:52.420]   because fellowship is to partner
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.760]   with another person who has the Holy Spirit,
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.260]   whether it is financial, whether it is encouragement,
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.420]   whether it is preaching the gospel,
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.000]   where we are partnering together.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.160]   But in the church, we call softball fellowship,
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.460]   hiking fellowship, ski fellowship,
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.700]   and anybody is welcome to this fellowship.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:15.000]   No, fellowship can only happen with genuine believers.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.020]   The church cannot be the light
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:23.740]   if you can't distinguish between the church and the world.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:32.120]   These are people, according to John chapter six,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.440]   who are excited about Jesus.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.620]   After Jesus feeds the 5,000,
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:42.060]   this crowd hit its peak.
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.280]   It says 5,000, but probably the actual number
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.340]   is closer to 20,000.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.620]   So 20,000 people are packing up their bags
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:51.380]   and their children, forgetting to pack lunch,
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.900]   and they're following Jesus everywhere.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.400]   So you would think, wow,
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.100]   Jesus' ministry is very successful.
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.180]   It actually tells us in verse 14,
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.220]   "Therefore, when the people saw the sign,"
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.700]   the feeding of the 5,000, "which he had performed,
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.580]   "they said, 'This is truly the prophet
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:06.900]   "'who has come into the world.'"
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.040]   Jesus, verse 15, "So Jesus, perceiving
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.700]   "that they were intending to come
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.340]   "and take him by force to make him king,
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.340]   "withdrew again to the mountain by himself."
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.380]   You say, wow, this crowd, like they know Jesus.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.260]   They wanted to make him king.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.220]   But when they finally catch up to Jesus
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:30.580]   on the other side of the sea, John 6, 26, 27,
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.840]   Jesus is not impressed.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.680]   And he warns them.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.720]   He said, "Jesus answered them and said,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.980]   "'Truly, truly, I say to you,
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.500]   "'you seek me not because you saw signs,
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.940]   "'because you ate of the loaves and were filled.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.640]   "'Do not work for the food which perishes,
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.840]   "'but for the food which endures to eternal life,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.460]   "'which the Son of Man will give to you,
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.620]   "'for on him the Father, God, has set his seal.'"
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.820]   He says, "You're not coming to me because you know me.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.660]   "You're coming to me because you got something from me."
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:03.340]   We have a clear distinction in our generation.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:06.380]   We know what the health and wealth gospel people look like.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:09.020]   'Cause they're open about it.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.300]   They'll tell you.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.980]   If you believe in Jesus, you're gonna be healthy.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.860]   You're gonna be wealthy.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.500]   And the preachers are the wealthiest person in that church,
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.300]   and they brag about how many cars they have
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.100]   and how they got jets that they fly on.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.540]   And so they're very open about it.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.740]   It is the false gospel, but they're very open about it.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.620]   But in a Bible-teaching church, it creeps it.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.780]   How many people follow Christ
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.560]   because of the benefit of following Christ?
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.720]   But when the trials and the temptation
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.780]   and the struggle comes, we question God.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.080]   So when he answers our prayer,
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.680]   and we were sick and we become healthy, praise God.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.840]   We get a better job, better pay, praise God.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.380]   When our children do well, praise God.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380]   God is blessing us.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.560]   But as soon as difficulty and trials come,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.400]   where is he?
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.840]   Is this a God worthy of worship?
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.520]   Is this a God that I'm going to trust
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.360]   if this is what he's going to allow happen in my life?
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.640]   How is that any different than a health and wealth gospel?
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.600]   We just didn't make it clear.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:20.560]   But our life reflects that we're not loyal to Christ.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.280]   We're loyal to what he can give,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.440]   the bread and the sustenance and the healing.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.180]   And that's exactly what Jesus was pointing out.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.080]   You're not coming to me because you know me.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.480]   You're coming to me because you ate.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.560]   When Jesus says, "I am the bread, I am the bread.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.760]   "I gave you physical bread so that you may know
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.340]   "that I am the bread, I am the life."
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:49.040]   And then they turned away from God.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.000]   And they walked away, just like Jesus told.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.640]   And the very reason why he was telling this parable
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.980]   gets fulfilled after the feeding of the 5,000.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:02.120]   So many people have walked away from their faith
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.020]   and yet functioning in the church.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:11.000]   So many people, and for every practical purposes,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.260]   Jesus Christ is not their king.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.280]   The word of God is open,
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.540]   but it doesn't have final authority over your life.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:24.000]   You test the word of God to see if you like it or not.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.680]   But the word of God doesn't have final authority
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.520]   over your life.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.400]   It is your own conscience, your own pleasure,
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.000]   your own pursuit, your own will,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.120]   determines what you will accept and what you will reject.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.380]   And so in every practical purpose,
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.680]   you have walked away from the faith,
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.000]   but not from the church.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.500]   Christianity, for those people, becomes a burden.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:51.400]   You hear the word of God, and outside of Jesus loves you,
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.480]   encourages you, you're gonna have eternity,
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.540]   there's hope in Christ, outside of those messages,
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.780]   every imperative becomes a burden.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.800]   Because you don't know the gift in Christ.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:09.320]   We say the gift of Christ, gift of salvation,
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.280]   is not that we get saved from hell.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.960]   Of course the Bible says we get saved from hell.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.880]   The gift of Christ is not the benefits.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   It's Christ himself.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.820]   What makes heaven heaven and hell hell
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.720]   is the presence of Christ and the absence of Christ.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.780]   If you have heaven, you have a mansion.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.040]   If you have heaven, and you have friends.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.560]   If you have heaven, and you have health.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.620]   And if you have heaven, and there's no tears,
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.420]   but you don't have Christ, that's not heaven.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.920]   Because the author of life is Christ.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.760]   So you can have all that looks like life without Christ,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.520]   you do not have life.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.800]   The whole point of salvation is to restore us
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.520]   to the author of life.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.140]   So you can come to church and mimic life,
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.960]   just like you mimic life outside.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.480]   But if you do not know Christ,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.940]   if your roots are not connected to the living water,
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.080]   which is Christ, you're only pretending.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.700]   Second Corinthians four, three to four says,
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.160]   and even if our gospel is veiled,
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.280]   it is veiled to those who are perishing.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.800]   In whose case the God of this world
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.320]   has blinded the minds of the unbelieving
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.960]   so that they may not see the light of the gospel,
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.800]   the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   He says when somebody who's received joy
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.200]   because they don't have root, and when they are tested,
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.480]   they found out that their faith wasn't genuine,
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.340]   and he says then the devil comes and snatches away the seed.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.580]   Which means they are still under the authority of Satan.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:55.440]   Just like it says the God of this age
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.380]   will continue to blind them.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.700]   Now let me conclude with this.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.500]   In Romans 12, one it says,
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.100]   therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God,
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.540]   to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.100]   acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.540]   of worship.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:15.100]   Now this is after 11 chapters
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.740]   of deep exposition of the gospel.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.720]   All of sin falls short of the glory of God.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.960]   Tells us that you are guilty,
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.200]   whether you are with the law or without the law.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.680]   How he saves us to free us from the slavery of sin,
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.360]   that we may become slaves of righteousness.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.240]   There is now therefore no condemnation
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.400]   for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.440]   that he saves us by his mercy.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.120]   And in chapter 11, up to chapter 12,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.520]   he basically tells us the deep understanding
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.920]   of the love of Christ, the sacrifice of Christ,
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.400]   the holiness of Christ, the wrath of Christ.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.960]   And then, in conclusion, in view of the mercy
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.220]   of the gospel that you have heard,
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.600]   present your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.280]   holy, acceptable, which is spiritual service of worship.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.260]   You know what's interesting is that word for spiritual,
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.900]   in the King James Version, it says reasonable.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.280]   In fact, if you have the NASB,
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.000]   most likely from that word spiritual,
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.800]   you'll have an asterisk or a number there,
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.520]   and if you follow that number,
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.160]   it'll say the literal interpretation
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.640]   is rational or logical.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.520]   That's what that word means.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.600]   Just that other translators translated spiritual
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.480]   because they thought that maybe we wouldn't understand
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.240]   what logical and rational meant.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.480]   The King James just said rational, right, reasonable.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.760]   But I think the understanding of it is clearer
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.080]   to interpret it exactly what it means,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.420]   that a logical, rational response
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.280]   to somebody who's heard the word of God,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.400]   believing that the Son of God who left everything
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.200]   to save sinners, allowed his only begotten sons
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.000]   to suffer for guilty, blasphemous people,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.560]   that if we genuinely believe that and accept that,
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.720]   that our reasonable, rational, logical response to that
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.440]   is for us to give our lives as a living sacrifice.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.520]   It is illogical, it is irrational
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.760]   for somebody who's professing that
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.960]   and then live like you never heard it.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.480]   And that's what the scripture is saying.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.120]   They may pretend, they may go through the motion,
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.000]   they may learn how to play the game,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.240]   holding on to a form of godliness, always learning,
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.200]   never coming to the knowledge of the truth.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.340]   They don't know Christ.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.060]   They do not know Christ.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:49.460]   The logical, rational, reasonable response
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.060]   to the things that you and I profess to know
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.180]   is to live the rest of our life pursuing more of him,
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.820]   wanting more of him, desiring to worship him,
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.580]   to be near him, to hear from him, to run to him,
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.700]   to fix our gaze upon him,
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.900]   because seeing him is what saved us.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:17.560]   Believing in him is what cleansed us.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.000]   Hoping in him is what perseveres us.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.600]   And so these two soils, the first one is obvious.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.360]   The second one, maybe some of you have a lump in your throat
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.600]   maybe 'cause you're convicted
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.320]   or maybe some of you are bothered.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.040]   You say, "This legalist."
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.200]   Anytime you don't like something being said,
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.040]   he's a legalist.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.760]   It's like, "Ah, legalist."
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.840]   Jesus hates legalists, that's you.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.120]   Again, the question is, is it biblical?
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.800]   Look at the Bible, is it biblical?
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.240]   Did I contradict anything the Bible said?
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.120]   Now let me warn you, I'm not done with my sermon.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.520]   I'm not done with my sermon.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.180]   My sermon's gonna continue next week,
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.720]   and if you are part of the fourth sermon, hang on.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.840]   Hang on.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.800]   The fourth sermon, if you are part of the fourth sermon,
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.760]   you will find tremendous encouragement.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:19.880]   If you're part of the second soil and you are bothered,
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.200]   you are really gonna be bothered next week.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.880]   The people in the third soil are the ones
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.520]   who are really gonna be bothered
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   because they're the hardest to tell.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.560]   They're in the church.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.060]   They might even be small group leaders.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.640]   Oftentimes, they're even leaders in the church,
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.320]   even pastors, and that's why it's so hard,
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.720]   and we need to be careful that we don't superficially
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.400]   just throw around, "Hey, Christian, non-Christian,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.240]   "Christian, non-Christian."
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.060]   We need to be careful.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.360]   Jesus told us to be careful,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.880]   but we also need to be able to discern.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:04.100]   It is not, it is not judgmental and hateful and legalistic
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.100]   to sell somebody who may not be a Christian
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.440]   to examine their faith.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.740]   It is much more hateful to have doubt over somebody's faith
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.800]   and never say anything 'cause you don't care.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.040]   You care more about your reputation.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.480]   You care more about their response.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.300]   You care more how they will view you by saying this.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:34.420]   It is not loving if you doubt and you say nothing.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.100]   Now, don't be a jerk.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.180]   Don't jump to conclusion.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.920]   Don't be judgmental.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.460]   Be gracious and loving and as patient as you can,
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.940]   but speak the truth in love.
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:50.140]   You can never compromise either.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.180]   You speak the truth without love, they will not hear.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:59.440]   You speak with love but no truth, and they will be condemned,
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.980]   and so I'm asking you to hang on, hang on,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.700]   because these are Jesus' words,
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:13.700]   and hearing the word of God, I pray, yes,
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.660]   even in a Bible-teaching church,
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.060]   even if you're a member of the church,
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.520]   even if you're serving in the church,
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.340]   that we would take some time to examine,
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:28.440]   is my life a reasonable response
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.380]   to what I confess to believe?
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.180]   Let's pray.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:40.940]   Father, we pray that the power of your word
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.260]   would grip us, grip your church,
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:48.820]   that we would not commit to a form, but to actual power,
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:53.220]   that we would not gain knowledge, but truth.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.940]   We pray, Father God, that your word that you have ordained,
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:58.260]   that you have sent out, would not return
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.700]   until it has accomplished the purpose
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.300]   that you have ordained.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.900]   May Christ, in Christ alone, be magnified.
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.240]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
