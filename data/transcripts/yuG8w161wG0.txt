[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   For those of you who are new to the church, we want to extend a warm welcome to you.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   After the service is done, please stop by our welcome booth.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   You'll see it in blue right outside in the courtyard.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We'd love to connect with you and give you more information about the church.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Turning to some announcements for us, we've been announcing that on the 19th,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Sunday is our Christmas service where we'll have children's performances and
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   a time of just really remembering our Lord.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   But after the service, the Outreach Team has scheduled a special reception for
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   our friends and family who don't know Christ, who we want to reach out to.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   So please take the opportunity.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   There's still invitation cards at the front table also available for you.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And take the opportunity also to go to the church Facebook or app.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And there's a link where if you would like the Outreach Team to join you in
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   prayer for the people that you're thinking about, you can submit their name or
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   just what your thoughts are, and they'll join you in prayer to lift that person up.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And for the other things we have, as again, the year kind of starts winding down,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   we have our various events.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   We have our ping pong tournament that's happening on the Friday, 6 p.m.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Please be sure to take a moment to sign up for that.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And it's going to be doubles only.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And so you'll either, A, sign up to be placed in a team or
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   to have a team that you want to enter into the tournament together.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   We'll also have our evening service at 11 p.m.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Make sure you make ample time to get washed up, whatever you need to come.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It'll be a sweet time for us to just reflect on the year and
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   devote that time together as a church to usher in the new one as well.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So the announcement I'd like to actually highlight too is this past week,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   our Titus Bible study came to an end.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   But we're taking sign-ups now for the next Bible study,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   which is going to be a study through 1 Peter.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Pastor Peter Chung will be continuing the inductive study.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   We'll do our study come and in the smaller settings,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   share our convictions, et cetera.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Please make sure you take a look at that sign-up and go ahead and sign up so
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   that we can make groups and make preparations for the next session.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   That's it for the announcements this morning.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Today we get the privilege of hearing Connor's testimony after our worship set.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   He'll be coming up to share with us and then be baptized this morning after the
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   praise set.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   At this time, let's join prayer together as we go into a time of offering.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you and praise you.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   God, we gather together desiring to lift up to you worship that is pleasing.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   God, we want to be focused on you.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And Lord, we desire to gather together collectively to render you our hearts.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And God, as we also lift up to you our offering,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   we pray, Father God,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   that our hearts would be eager to lift up to you many things beyond just our
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   finances.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   But Lord,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   would you continue to use the finances to the furthering of your kingdom for
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   the work of your ministry and the edification of this church.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   We pray for the service, God, this morning.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   God, this would be both an edifying time for us as we hear, as we sing.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   God, our hearts would be encouraged to faith.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   But also, Lord, that in all things it would be to your honor and your glory.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Amen.

[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I was born and raised in a Christian home.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   My parents were Christian as well.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   They regularly visited church and Bible study and prayed with us.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   As such, I followed suit and regularly attended church and youth fellowship every week.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I began to learn more about Christianity and the commands that God has given to us.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   But I didn't question it or dive deeper to study it.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   It was just a set of morals to keep, something to memorize.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Later on in my life, my family and I moved a couple times,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and I left my childhood friends and church near the end of elementary school.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It was then that I started to feel disconnected from my faith.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I still outwardly looked like a Christian, attended church, fellowship, and prayed,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   but I was slowly drifting.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   The years went by, and I drifted more and more until I had almost stopped praying,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   reading the Bible, and ultimately having any relationship with God.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   I was alone a lot during this time, and I filled my time with school, hobbies,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and living more and more for entertainment.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   It was then when I had more free time than ever before,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and I started questioning my life and realized how much sin was going on,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   at least more than I expected to see.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   At first, I just tried fighting it myself, but none of it worked,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   and I always kept finding myself sinning again and again.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   It was then I remembered my Christian upbringing
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   and started thinking more about my faith and what God meant to me.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I cried out to God in prayer and asked for guidance in fighting these sins,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   still mostly from my own conscience and with little understanding.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Even so, God heard me and answered,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   helping me to slowly shift away from the sins that were plaguing me at the time.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   A verse that helped me through this was Ephesians 5.8.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It says, "For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Walk as children of light."
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Here, Paul is writing to the Church of Ephesus,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   telling them to be imitators of God, of Christ,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   to not partake in the sin and immorality of those around them and in the world.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Seeing this, I started to acknowledge that God was there for me
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and read the Bible to know more about him.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   It was here where I started wanting to give my life over to God.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   After this, things started to change quickly.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   I started to see how important the Word of God is and how it applied to me
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and started listening more attentively in church and studies.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I saw how it helped me to progress in my fight against sin
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and finally feeling like I could be set free from it.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Even though I was by myself a lot during this time,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I did not feel alone or sad, knowing that I had God
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and that he had plans for me beyond my understanding.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I felt that I had given myself to God, wanting to serve him and have him as my God.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   However, what was missing was a true understanding of the relationship between us.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I positioned in front of him as a sinner and a church fellowship that I could connect with.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Then, I started attending Berean regularly,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   virtually at first because of quarantine, but then in person as well due to school being online.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I gained a good fellowship that I could connect with,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   and through the youth group and college teachings and Bible studies,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I gained more knowledge and finally started to see the reality,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   both the sin in my life but also the mercy and grace of God.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   It was then, earlier this year, that I finally felt that I understood my faith and relation to God,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   truly giving myself to him, repenting for my sins,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   asking for his forgiveness, and being fully transformed by the love of Christ.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I can now truly say that I am a Christian, have a relationship with God,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and can stand forgiven in front of God in heaven by the blood of Jesus Christ,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   who saved me to walk as a child of God. Thank you.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   [applause]
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   [silence]
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   [inaudible]
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   [applause]
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   [silence]
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Amen. What a blessing to hear his testimony. Thank you, brother.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Please turn your Bibles over to Colossians 1, verses 24 through 29.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Colossians 1, verses 24 through 29.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   [silence]
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Take a moment to read the text for us this morning, and it says,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   "Now I rejoice in my suffering for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   on behalf of his body, which is the church,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   in filling up what is lacking in Christ's affliction.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Of this church I was made a minister, according to the stewardship from God,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   the preaching of the word of God.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   That is the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   but has now been manifested to his saints,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   We proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   For this purpose also I labor, striving according to his power,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   which mightily works within me." Let's pray.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Lord God, we want to truly thank you for all that you are,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and Lord, all that you are doing in our lives currently.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   We thank you God that you continue just to instruct us, leading us, Lord, in your way.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And we thank you Father for we recognize that that is causing us to grow into Christ,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   causing us to mature, and we desire this in our lives.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   So we thank you Lord this morning, it's in Christ and we pray. Amen.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   This verse that I just read to you is a familiar verse,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and if you attend any biblical counseling conference and you have an introductory session
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   where they lay the foundations of biblical counseling, they'll read this verse,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   because it lays to you the objective and the goal.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And this verse is very encouraging and challenging to me every time I attend a pastor's conference,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   or sometimes as I think about pastoral ministry I come back to this verse
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   because it lays down for us what is the vision,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   what is the conviction of the ministry we are involved in.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And there was once a time I attended a missions conference,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and I heard a pastor who was out on the field come in and give the congregation a strong, powerful exhortation.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   But within it he was saying to the entirety of the group that was there,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   it wasn't just pastors and missionaries, but it was just church people too,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and he said, "Every single one of you are missionaries, whether you like it or not.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   God has sent you. You're a missionary.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And so wherever you are, act like a missionary.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Behave like a missionary. Serve like a missionary."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And it was interesting because when I first heard a sermon like that,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   because I've heard sermons like that several times,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   the first time, I don't know why, but in my heart of hearts I was thinking, "Nah.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   We're not all missionaries. I haven't been commissioned by the church.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   They didn't lay hands on me, ordain me, and entrust to me the planting of churches abroad."
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And I was thinking in that way.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   But we get the point, actually, is that yes, actually not all of you in here are called to be missionaries
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   in the technical sense of the term.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   You haven't been ordained by the church, right?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   But every single one of us should know how to evangelize.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Every single one of us should have an eternal perspective that if we're not evangelizing,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   we are missing the greatest objective of our day.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And what's more, we should seek the joys of a missionary,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   wanting to present the most precious thing that I have in the gospel of Christ,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   giving it to somebody and seeing them hear change, be transformed, and to receive.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   That should be in the top of our ambitions.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   That should be at the top of our thoughts, right?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You know, we have a baptism today.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   It reminded me of a time when there was a young sister who got baptized.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Great testimony, and I had to kind of walk her out that way.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   You know, they go out that way, and they come around to the back.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   But as she was sharing her testimony, she mentioned that there's somebody in her life
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   who was sitting down with her, talking with her, asking good questions, praying and praying,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   interceding, sharing the gospel, and was so pivotal to her salvation.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Well, lo and behold, as soon as we walk out that door,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   that friend is at the back of the building just jumping for joy, doing these hand waves,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   so giddy, like almost galloping like a horse,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   running all the way down the full length of the building, just happy, saying, "Yay!"
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And I'm there sitting, I couldn't help but just smile, share the joy,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and I almost wanted to say, "Yeah!" You know, like just joining the fun.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And then realizing, "Oh, shoot, I'm ruining this special moment for these two."
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   That's part of my job, ruining intimate moments.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   But honestly speaking, there was no way to take that joy from her.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   As a friend, I mean, it was just sweet.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   But the challenge for us is like, we should be wanting to experience the joy
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   because the great, great goal of sharing the gospel comes with it,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   the reaping of the great, great joy as with sharing the joys of heaven,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   sharing in the angels rejoicing over one soul that was lost but now found, right?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And so likewise, when it comes to the care of souls,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   not every single one of you are called to be shepherds, right?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   You may not be called to be a pastor full-time devoted to pulpit ministry,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   preaching, right, exhorting and challenging and counseling and meeting.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   You may not be called to that.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   But the fact of the matter is every single believer, nevertheless,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   we need to learn how to love, to admonish, to counsel,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   sometimes to do the hard work of walking alongside,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   rebuking if necessary, grieving together, interceding for that person.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   That's something that we should have as our joys.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   That should be something we should have as an objective and a greater goal in our life
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   that we are exercising God's overall, we can say objectively,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   God's will for every single one of you is to be used in that capacity
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   even if it be for one person's life, right?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And there are.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   There are great joys associated with being able to walk alongside somebody,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   being able to desire their good in such a way that you want nothing more than for them
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   to be strong and consistent with Christ.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And when we do that and devote ourselves, we reap an incredible benefit.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And that benefit sometimes I see, you know, I get to officiate a lot of weddings
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   and attend a lot of weddings,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   but I actually particularly enjoy officiating because I have a very unique vantage point
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   sitting right here or standing here with the couple right in front of me
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   but also seeing the face of parents who love them.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You know, in a lot of the weddings that I go to,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   they have that special ceremony where they light the candles.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Nowadays, they have, you know, some botany, planting plants and sand and all that stuff.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   But after they finish, they walk down and they go to their parents
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   and you can see the pride in the parents' faces.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   They stand up, you know, like ready.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And for parents who are so heavily invested to pray and to raise up their children,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   to now see them suited up, you know, and entering into that phase of their life, I mean,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and then the moments when they hug and they cry, it still pulls at your heart strings
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   because you know that that investment as a parent is deep,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   and therefore the joy that they receive from seeing their parents,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   seeing their children go into their next stage of life, that pride is overwhelming, right?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It's sweet.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And so what I want to encourage you with today is as I read this passage,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   this passage is Apostle Paul with a vision for the ministry God has given him.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   He is establishing the grand goal that he has for his life.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And I want to encourage you that every single believer should have a vision for ministry
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   even if you're not called to full-time ministry,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   even if you're not called to have a title of missionary, small group leader, elder or deacon,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   whatever it may be, that may not be God's specific role for you.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   But we can say objectively speaking it is to God's good pleasure,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   it is in his design for you to be of service to him and reap the joys of that ministry.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Amen?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And so with that said, I want to start by reading verse 24 again
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   where it describes here Apostle Paul thinking about his ministry.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And what he says is, "Now I rejoice in my suffering for your sake,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body," which is the church,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "in filling up what is lacking in Christ's affliction."
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   From this I want to draw a major point which is we must suffer the difficulty
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   and yet reap the joys of ministry.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   We must suffer the difficulties and yet reap the joys of ministry.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   When you take a look at this passage, a lot of things are actually really profound
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and some of it sounds even funny.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   But the thing that probably pops out to you most is this idea of Christ's affliction
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   and somehow Apostle Paul filling it.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   There have been entire books wondering like, "What in the world does that mean?"
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And so I want to highlight to you one observation.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Clearly suffering and affliction for the church is a given part of the ministry.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Because if you read it in some sense, Apostle Paul is literally saying,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   "I'm suffering for your sake just as Christ is suffering for your sake,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and I'm doing what he has been doing." Yes?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "I am continuing what he's done."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And if you kind of read the way that it's sounding, he's saying he is filling up
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and doing what has been laid out already in terms of Christ's suffering.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And we already know the Scripture has warned us,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   the Scripture has given to us a picture of what this ministry should look like,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   that one, every believer who desires to live a godly life will suffer.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   But what's more, as soon as you name Christ, he says,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   "It is enough for you to be my disciple. I am the teacher and your master.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   If they hated me, what do you think they will do to you?"
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   As soon as you name Jesus Christ, you had enemies, and you were going to suffer.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And what's more, specifically the Apostle Paul, Christ himself had told him,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   "You are going to suffer greatly for my name.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   You are going to suffer greatly for the gospel." Right?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And so what I'm talking about is what pops out from this very first verse
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   is this idea that Apostle Paul saw the suffering within the ministry,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   saw the affliction and the breadth of it.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   There's another passage I want to highlight to you in terms of Apostle Paul's perspective on his suffering.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And it comes from 2 Corinthians 4.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Verse 5 starts reading this way.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   [Reading verse 5]
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   [Reading verse 5]
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   [Reading verse 5]
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.180]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.180]   in the face of Christ.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.700]   But we have this treasure in earthen vessels
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.220]   so that the surpassing greatness of the power
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.020]   will be of God and not of ourselves.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.580]   We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed,
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.420]   perplexed, but not despairing, persecuted,
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.260]   but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed,
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.780]   always caring about in the body the dying of Jesus
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.900]   so that the life of Jesus
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.600]   also may be manifested in our body.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.140]   For we who are, so for we who live
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.160]   are constantly being delivered over to death
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.780]   for Jesus' sake so that the life of Jesus
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.480]   also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.720]   So death works in us, but life in you.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.760]   Do you see what he's saying here?
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   He is describing his ministry as one
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.840]   that is wrought with affliction so much so
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.640]   he is describing it literally as a pouring out and of death.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.120]   He is dying.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.280]   And if you think about that,
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.440]   I know that for us, every single one of us,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.760]   having read various parts of scripture,
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.220]   we know that suffering is a given in the Christian life.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.320]   But what's more, as soon as you take upon the desire
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   to love somebody, as soon as you take upon the desire
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.820]   to preach the gospel, you know you're gonna face
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.200]   walls, oppositions, and conflicts, yes?
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.680]   Okay, that being the case, I push this point to you
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.640]   because I find in myself sometimes
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   this little inner heart that resists and denies
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.080]   that that should be the case.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.220]   Sometimes surprised that ministry is difficult,
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.120]   surprised that people aren't following as they ought to,
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.720]   surprised that they're frustrated.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.860]   And what I'm saying is I'm sharing this conviction
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.640]   that suffering is a part of the ministry
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.240]   and that we should bear it,
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.280]   we should understand and accept it
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.020]   because in confession, I think there are times
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   where I'm not willing to even be annoyed, let alone suffer.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.760]   I think there are times where I'm not willing
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.240]   to be frustrated, let alone suffer.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.760]   And there is a strange thought in my mind,
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.260]   like why, why aren't you listening?
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.320]   Why, why is it so hard?
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.000]   Da-da-da-da.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.960]   And I have moments like that,
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.240]   and this passage comes back to me like,
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.720]   what in the world am I doing?
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.580]   There is a taking up of a burden of love
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.680]   that I voluntarily did when I entered into ministry,
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.620]   let alone not just simply entered into ministry,
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.620]   when I desire to follow Christ.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.600]   And yet sometimes we can find ourselves doing this way,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.040]   and what's even more challenging is a second observation
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.960]   that Apostle Paul sees that kind of suffering
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.920]   and he rejoices in it.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.280]   He says literally in verse 24 at the beginning,
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.200]   I rejoice in my suffering for your sake.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.680]   And the point that we're looking at then
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.360]   is he is joyfully taking upon himself
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.720]   all the baggage, the whole bag of responsibility
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.100]   and burden to care for the church,
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.040]   to minister to the church.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.200]   He is willing to take guests to sleepless nights,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.760]   he is willing to take the beatings,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.920]   he is willing to take the frustrations and all,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.080]   the whole baggage.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.700]   We have a lot of people in this country
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.480]   where they're willing to take the whole baggage
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.140]   for a dog, a cat, a bird, a parakeet, whatever it may be.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.600]   We understand what it means.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.400]   And yet we also have a ton of people
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.860]   who hate working with people.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.580]   It's really interesting to me.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:24.480]   But we understand that, that as soon as you decide to care,
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.080]   as soon as you decide to want to be of help,
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.460]   there is a burden of love you take.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.720]   You know, as I was thinking about this,
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   I couldn't help but think about this idea of burden of love
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.360]   and it made my memories come back to a moment
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.840]   when I saw a movie in the theaters with my mom,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.400]   just the two of us.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.520]   One time it happened.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.040]   My mom invited me and said,
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.000]   "Do you want to watch this Korean movie with me
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.720]   "called Ode to My Father?"
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.560]   Okay?
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.780]   Now the thing about it is I said,
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.320]   "Dude, she invited me, of course," so I went.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.400]   Crazy thing is as soon as I arrived to the theaters,
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.960]   it was the theater right in front of UCI
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.820]   in that plaza next to Target and stuff.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.640]   And as soon as I arrived, I was like,
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.740]   "Oh, I am the only one of my age."
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.200]   Out of cars and vans were just all these 70, 80,
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.920]   90-year-old grandmas and grandpas from their church
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.480]   that just filed out.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.560]   And when I entered into the theater, it was jam-packed.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.160]   Some of the people on walkers,
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.080]   some of the people like careful to sit down.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.200]   And I'm thinking, "Okay, gotta prepare my heart for this."
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.000]   Soon as the movie began, it was about the sufferings
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   during the Korean War generation.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.480]   The central figure, this young boy, loses his father
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.640]   in a desperate attempt to escape on the boat, so to speak.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.320]   But he has this promise to his father
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.840]   he's gonna take care of his family.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.520]   And in their separation, he says,
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.780]   "We're gonna meet at the store sometime, you know,
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.720]   "the store that your aunt owns," or something like that.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.240]   And it just trails this young individual growing
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.720]   and going through suffering after suffering
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.040]   just to make a buck, he goes into the coal mines,
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.880]   risks his life, he gets buried in ashes.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.560]   Just to make a buck, he goes to the military and gets shot.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.120]   Just to make a buck, and it just keeps going nonstop,
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.760]   just suffering and suffering.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.400]   And in the movie, there's a great job showing
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.560]   the individual just getting weathered down.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.040]   The wife, he eventually gets married,
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.020]   and the wife just worried out of her mind, like,
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.400]   "Is my husband even gonna make it?"
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.060]   And every time she sees him come home
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.460]   with some kind of injury, some kind of pain,
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.760]   she's just like wrecked, 'cause she doesn't want that for him.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.200]   And then there was this moment,
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.000]   so already the auditorium or the theater
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.040]   was, had many moments of people just sniffling
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.280]   and watery eyes, but there was a moment in their older age,
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.520]   the husband looked at the wife,
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.720]   and they were just in tears, no movie,
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.100]   and the husband said to the wife,
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.200]   "Aren't you so glad that it was us that suffered,
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.400]   "and not our kids?"
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.400]   She's so glad it was us.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.500]   And then I looked over at my mom,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.640]   and I just lost it, you know?
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.480]   Like, "Ahh!"
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.540]   And just crying, crying, and then
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.840]   a little old lady in front of me just weeping,
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.320]   and I couldn't, just, just thinking.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:20.480]   But that is the heart of our Savior.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.460]   That's the heart of a good shepherd.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   It's the good heart of a good churchman.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.640]   If you have walked life,
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.960]   and you've seen people go through pains,
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.000]   and you wanna spare them from those pains,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.960]   that you would be willing to take upon
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.500]   the burden of love on your shoulders for them.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.840]   That's Apostle Paul saying, "It's my joy
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.800]   "to suffer on your behalf."
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   It's a privilege to carry this burden for you.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.120]   Colossians chapter two, verse one, he adds,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.040]   "I want you to know how great a struggle
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.080]   "I have on your behalf,
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.740]   "that for those who are in Laodicea,
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.340]   "and for all those who have not personally seen my face."
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.520]   I mean, he adds to this by adding that there are people
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.020]   that he hasn't even met yet,
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.480]   and yet his love extends.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.320]   Why?
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.880]   Because when you have the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.100]   fueling you, and you know what it means
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.320]   to carry this burden, and you know what it means
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.600]   for an individual to not have Christ,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.760]   to not walk the right path with God,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.300]   you know what pains, suffering, and ultimate death there is,
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.400]   you don't have to see that whoever the object
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.800]   of your affection is going to reciprocate to you.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.360]   They don't even have to know you.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.440]   They don't have to know your face.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.920]   He just knows that it's to God's good pleasure
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.840]   and his own that he would serve them in this way.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.160]   And so I wanna give this challenge again.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.960]   For us, there is this paradox for the Christian life.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.760]   You're gonna pray for people and grieve with them.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.680]   Some people will not listen to you.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.440]   Some people will be hard-hearted,
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.640]   and you're gonna grieve all the more,
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.360]   but nevertheless, carrying that burden to you
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.160]   will be a joy because you are sharing the joy
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.380]   also in ministry with Christ, amen?
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.660]   Next, as we continue on the vision of this ministry,
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.300]   I wanna give this point that God has given to us,
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.540]   a scope of ministry, and it is the full instruction
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.380]   of the word of God, okay?
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.140]   God gave us a scope of ministry,
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.940]   and it has to be the full instruction of the word of God.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.200]   What do I mean?
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.760]   Well, when you take a look at this passage,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.100]   let's read again, starting from verse 25.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.260]   He said, "Of this church I was made a minister
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.300]   "according to the stewardship from God,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.320]   "bestowed on me for your benefit,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.600]   "so that I might fully carry out the preaching
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.300]   "of the word of God."
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.540]   Apostle Paul has a clear focus.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.260]   It is broad.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.500]   It is incredibly large and huge,
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.140]   but nevertheless, he has a clear focus
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.020]   on the parameters of his ministry
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.900]   that he's supposed to preach.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.120]   Verse 26, "That is, the mystery which has been given
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.960]   "from the past ages, generations,
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.220]   "but has," ages and generations,
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.680]   "but has now been manifested to his saints,
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.480]   "to whom God willed to make known
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.580]   "what is the riches of the glory of his mystery
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.860]   "among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you,
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.280]   "the hope of glory.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   "So we proclaim him, admonishing every man
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.580]   "and teaching every man with all wisdom."
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.500]   To me, this is an incredibly encouraging point.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.860]   Initially, it might not sound like it when I say,
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.500]   God has ordained a scope of ministry,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.460]   a parameter in which you're supposed to do,
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.480]   and outside that, you don't need to do.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.800]   And why is that encouraging?
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.000]   Why is it encouraging is because what that means
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.340]   is God has ordained the means
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.820]   by which he is going to accomplish this ministry,
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.020]   and he's given it to me.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.940]   I don't have to be a trailblazer
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.080]   making a new religion or a new fad.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.740]   That's really encouraging to me,
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.540]   'cause I'm not creative.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.300]   I'm not that strong.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.340]   I'm not a forerunner.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.420]   I'm not some trailblazer with great ambitions.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.700]   You know why that's encouraging to me?
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.840]   It's encouraging to me because I don't have
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.100]   all the wisdom of the world.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.780]   I'm not a financial advisor.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.200]   I'm not an academic counselor.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.140]   I'm not a guru and stuff.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.180]   Maybe dating, I may be a guru.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.540]   I'm just kidding, I'm not.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:35.300]   Why is that encouraging is because I know what I need to do.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.000]   Whatever explicitly clear in the scriptures I must preach,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.060]   and that is the conviction by which I came into ministry.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.960]   Pastor Peter sat me down as a young 18-year-old and said,
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.140]   let's meet together and read the Bible,
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.380]   'cause I would regularly tell him I love Jesus,
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.580]   but I have so much sin in my life.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.300]   Sometimes I'm out of control.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.820]   Can't control my own pride.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.540]   Can't control my own lust.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.140]   What's going on?
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.420]   Pastor Peter sat me down and said,
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.460]   let's week by week go through scripture,
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.860]   and I remember thinking like,
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.960]   the word of God is so good,
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.340]   so powerful,
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.860]   do you think I could one day be a part
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.500]   of teaching people the Bible?
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.980]   I remember him saying, that's a good conviction.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.820]   No.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.640]   (laughing)
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.340]   Just kidding, he said, there's so much more to ministry
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.740]   than just that.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.360]   There's so much more to ministry than just that,
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.820]   but nevertheless, that was my conviction.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.100]   But look at what Apostle Paul is saying.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.460]   He understands God's gifted stewardship,
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.540]   and Apostle Paul is always humbly like,
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.580]   I was a blasphemer, a reviler, an aggressor to the church,
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.420]   and now he's giving me this mercy to carry the word?
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.500]   Wow, what privilege.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.260]   But then also, what focus, and he says,
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.380]   I'm gonna be preaching the mysteries of God,
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.580]   I will be revealing what God wants to make known,
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.860]   which is Christ in you.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.220]   The Savior and Messiah you've been looking for,
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.980]   hoping he would march into town
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:03.100]   and overthrow the government, is residing in you.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.860]   I wanna teach you that,
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.740]   and how much treasure and wealth and joy
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.380]   comes from knowing that the Savior is with you.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.700]   And he says, I'm gonna be admonishing every man.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:18.300]   That means warning, that means rebuke,
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.980]   that means guiding away and reasoning with the man,
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.900]   changing a person's mind and saying,
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:25.960]   let's think differently than how you used to think.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.460]   And he says, I am gonna teach every man with all wisdom.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.440]   That is Apostle Paul's ambition in ministry,
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.440]   because that is the scope of ministry God has ordained.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.980]   Do you see my point?
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.060]   He has clarity because he knows that that is from God.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:47.460]   And so I wanna share with you that this is my ambition,
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.280]   but I also have another conviction and confession.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.020]   I'm still scared to do it.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.720]   I've been a pastor now for over 10 years.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.580]   I am still scared to do it.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.940]   Sometimes I go out on the, you know,
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.260]   the random EV, going out to the malls and the town centers,
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.780]   and then that first person you talk to,
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.220]   you're just like, hello.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.300]   It's so awkward.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.400]   We're here today.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.460]   Here, take this survey.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.300]   What do you think?
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.460]   And then finally you warm up,
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.460]   and the second one's like, oh, okay, yeah.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.860]   You know, what do you think about this really?
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.540]   And then you start to, but then that initial one
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.380]   is always so wrought with fear.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.300]   Guess what?
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.980]   Even though you guys know, like I love biblical counseling,
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.820]   I love sitting down and talking with people one-to-one,
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:35.220]   sometimes I'm afraid, getting mega awkward.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.420]   I'll just come sit down with a brother and say,
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.120]   he, you know, like, I've got something to say.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.100]   Especially if an individual needs
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.540]   some rebuking and correction.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.940]   And sometimes I've resorted to silly things, you know?
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.100]   Going on long rants, asking a million questions,
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.660]   beating around the bush.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.580]   I've learned, I learned a lot from Pastor Peter Chung
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.980]   that if you add an accent, you could say a lot of stuff.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   You know, it's like, you know, what you do yesterday,
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.220]   no thank you very much, you know?
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.780]   Like, he does that thing where he says,
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.580]   no thank you very much, and it works.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.500]   But I'm just confessing to you,
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.620]   we all have the fears of speaking this truth.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:18.640]   But if we don't, then there's a lot of implications to that.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.400]   I am not fulfilling the ordained stewardship that I have.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.540]   What's more, from the preaching is where God desired
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.000]   to highlight the transformative,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.860]   great glory of Christ's grace in you.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.740]   So that the more you see it, the more you change.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.860]   And yet here I am afraid, like, I don't know.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:41.060]   But I get it, because I wrestle with the same fears.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.780]   It's huge risk, risking our friendship,
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.580]   risking the camaraderie we had,
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:49.260]   risking my own whatever, my face.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.420]   There's so much risk there.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:55.080]   But brothers and sisters, we have to have a greater vision,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.060]   clear vision, like Apostle Paul.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.860]   This, this is a scope and means God has ordained
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.660]   to edify and sanctify his church, amen?
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:11.100]   Let's move forward to think more about the vision.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.780]   And the second observation is this.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.220]   The reason why we can overcome our fears
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:21.580]   is because the substance and power God has already ordained.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.360]   You understand this, when Apostle Paul is talking
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.540]   about Christ's glory in you, that is the central idea,
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.140]   and the power behind it, everything.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.940]   So what I'm saying is, we need not fear the means,
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.940]   it's because, okay, the content has already been put into it.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.780]   If I am afraid of speaking, that must mean
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.540]   that I am not so confident in the content.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.980]   But now as time has passed, I am so confident
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:51.500]   in the word of God, I can risk sounding prideful.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.320]   Let me explain.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:56.360]   I believe in the word of God so much
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.700]   that if I faithfully study and I present this to you,
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.240]   but something doesn't go right,
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.340]   and sometimes people have started accusing me,
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.900]   like, oh, you just have it out for me,
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.860]   or sometimes people have been so defensive
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.480]   to fight back, you know, I can say, the problem is you.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.940]   It's not this.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.500]   It's not God's way, it's not God's word,
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.740]   that something is wrong here.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.060]   I'm gonna recheck my own heart, but something is wrong,
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.520]   and it's not the Bible.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.940]   Does that sound really arrogant?
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.000]   To some it may, to some it may.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.720]   But when you're so confident in the content,
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.020]   that Christ, who is to us our treasure,
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.240]   that the Lord and his word is powerful
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.460]   and working in the spirit of God, will not be denied.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.060]   That's not arrogance.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:45.720]   You're just believing what God has said.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.400]   And so for some of you who struggle with like,
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.980]   oh gosh, am I just working out of my own strength,
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.960]   or am I working out of God's power?
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.940]   When you trust what God has said,
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.580]   and when you trust the power of his word,
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.820]   there's humility in that.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.140]   There's confidence in that, there's clarity in that,
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.660]   and I want everybody to have
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.020]   that kind of vision for ministry.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.660]   Take a look at this passage, Colossians chapter two.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:11.020]   Colossians chapter two, verse one, he says,
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.360]   "For I want you to know how great a struggle
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.140]   "I have on your behalf."
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:18.660]   He struggled so much, and that's not arrogant, you know why?
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.820]   Because he goes on to say that he struggled
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.260]   for those who are in Laodicea,
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.200]   and for all those who have not personally seen my face,
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.080]   that their hearts may be encouraged,
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.680]   having been knit together in love,
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.400]   attaining to all the wealth that comes
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.500]   from the full assurance of understanding,
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.320]   resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery,
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.020]   that is Christ himself, in whom are hidden
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.400]   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.020]   When I want for you everything in Christ,
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:49.160]   when I want for you the fullness of instruction,
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.120]   going from conceptual knowledge to practical living
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.480]   and practical theology, that is having confidence
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.280]   in God promised, that that will produce godliness.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.600]   Have that kind of conviction.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.520]   And so, all of that speaks to the ambition
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.120]   and goal that we have.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.080]   And so I wanna move to point three.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.800]   The ambition and goal that we have must be
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.100]   to aim for the completeness in Christ.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.880]   You must aim for completeness in Christ.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.260]   And although that may just sound
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.920]   like typical Christian jargon,
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.520]   we know what we're talking about.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:27.360]   Our aim is not go to church, good, you went.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.680]   Our aim is not have a discipler,
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.320]   good, you have somebody in your life.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   Our aim is the full maturity of growing wisdom
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.440]   where your mind, heart, desire, and more,
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.900]   your reaction, emotions, and more,
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.540]   are in likeness to Christ.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:48.720]   Our desire and our ambition is to see
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.420]   every single Christian grow in the full maturity
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.400]   of our Lord Jesus.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.960]   And this is where Pastor Peter,
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:59.240]   when he was telling me about there's so much more,
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.720]   if you really understand what God has designed for it,
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.360]   you realize that is a massive thing.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.380]   When Apostle Paul says, "I am proclaiming, admonishing,
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.280]   "and teaching every man with all wisdom
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:16.840]   "so that we may present every man complete in Christ,"
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.380]   do you understand how massive that goal is?
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.640]   Because then it's not even limited
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.060]   to just preaching and teaching and counseling, right?
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.900]   To want to see somebody complete and mature in Christ,
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.040]   there is no end to that work.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.520]   But what's more, Apostle Paul is not just thinking
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.240]   about one person, he's not thinking about one church,
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.820]   he's thinking about the churches
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.960]   and even the people he hasn't even met yet.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.940]   Take a look at this passage in Ephesians chapter four.
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:49.320]   Please turn your Bibles there, Ephesians chapter four.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:54.680]   Apostle Paul talks about the design of the church
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.960]   and the ambition and the goal that resides in his heart,
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.220]   but is the command of God,
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.340]   the expectation and the work of God.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.240]   So Ephesians chapter four, starting from verse 11,
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.420]   Apostle Paul says this,
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.800]   "And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.160]   "and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.320]   "for the equipping of the saints for the work of service
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.880]   "to the building up of the body of Christ,
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.660]   "until we all attain to the unity of faith."
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.460]   Think about this.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:28.740]   To a minister of God, who is a servant of God,
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.860]   he should never be okay that his little crew is good
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.780]   but not everybody else.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.620]   Why?
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.780]   This passage literally says that the ambition and goal
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.520]   is that we all attain to this unity of faith.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.640]   And he's not okay that there's a bunch of people
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.440]   just falling out in the background.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.360]   Truth be told, conviction on my end,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.060]   after however many years of ministry,
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.220]   there have been so many people who come to church,
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.840]   I build a relationship with them,
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.340]   sometimes meeting with them multiple times a week,
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:59.720]   sometimes meeting with them when there's immediate,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.540]   sorry, urgent calls, crisis situations,
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.420]   only to have them literally say later on,
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.260]   it's like, "Guy, you know what?
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.840]   "I'm done with that stuff."
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.580]   Or even as brazen as to say,
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.260]   "I don't think you preach the gospel.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.140]   "You guys are wrong, I'm right," and they leave.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.100]   After a few of those, you kind of think,
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.600]   it's okay if people leave.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.000]   (laughs)
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.940]   You just start thinking like,
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:27.360]   yeah, it's better if they kind of shoo away from me.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.760]   That can't be the heart of a pastor, right?
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.440]   Because it does break your heart when people leave
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.640]   'cause sometimes I think I want that person to be here
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.480]   under my teaching and my care,
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.740]   not because I'm an arrogant man,
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.300]   because it breaks my heart to think
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.540]   he doesn't have anything.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.700]   It breaks my heart to think he's just going wayward
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.240]   by whatever he's reading online,
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.500]   that he doesn't have a caring brother to ask questions.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:03.220]   But unfortunately, if we're not careful, we could.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.160]   Because of just the nature of the fact
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.020]   that people come and go,
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.320]   you're just completely okay with people going.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.920]   But the ambition actually is no.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.400]   Every one of you in here who has committed
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.520]   to bringing community to church, we want to be united.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.700]   Amen?
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.540]   We want to be growing together.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.660]   And he goes on, he says,
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.800]   that we want to have the knowledge of the Son of God
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   to a mature man, to the measure and the stature
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.080]   which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.800]   And so as a result, we're no longer to be children
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.200]   tossed here and there by waves
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   and carried about by every wind of doctrine,
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.500]   by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.380]   But speaking the truth in love,
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:48.600]   we are to grow up in all aspects into him who is the head,
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.680]   even Christ.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.980]   Do you see the goal here?
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.280]   Apostle Paul is saying,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.020]   we want to present you complete in Christ.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.420]   And he's using the word teleon,
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.300]   which is talking about a fulfillment,
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.860]   a growing fulfillment of the picture that God has for you.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.860]   I know for some of us, it's really annoying
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.340]   if you've had really controlling parents
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.700]   where they have a very specific idea
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.140]   of what they want you to become.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.500]   I want you to become a lawyer
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.140]   is what my parents said to me when I was young.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.700]   And then I disappointed them royally.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.940]   It's like, I'm going into ministry, you know?
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.340]   And sometimes that can be annoying also
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.540]   if in our hearts we think, dude, I'm trying my best.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.680]   Why in the world are we never satisfied?
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.720]   It's always more, better, faster.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.740]   But actually between us and God,
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:41.460]   it's not God who has to relinquish his expectations
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.460]   and standards for us.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:48.460]   It's us who have to, we have to regularly break our pride,
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.200]   come to greater conformity,
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.940]   and just keep surrendering to the high standard of God.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.780]   You know why?
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.500]   Because God out of his love wants to present you holy.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.860]   I get challenged by this.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.420]   I'm like, whoa, wait a minute, in my counseling,
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:10.080]   have I just succumbed to what is acceptable
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.700]   and census says everyone's okay with this.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.300]   Have I done that?
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.800]   And I repented like, God, what you say in your word
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.380]   is that God has reconciled us through his son,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.580]   the bodily death of his son,
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.940]   so that he would present us holy and blameless
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.040]   and above reproach,
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.980]   that there not be a single blemish on us.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.620]   God has a meticulous eye to you and me,
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.260]   and we dare not look at that with annoyance,
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.800]   but say, Lord, thank you.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.140]   You love me like no one loves me,
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.780]   because you're not satisfied
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.260]   with even one imperfection in my life.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.720]   Is that the goal that you're operating off of?
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.340]   When have we given some advice,
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.720]   and maybe somebody has come to you
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.020]   and asked you some questions,
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.580]   and you're just kind of like,
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.620]   yeah, I mean, technically, that's not wrong,
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.100]   and then it could go either way,
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.940]   but then you don't wanna say,
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.000]   so then a lot of times, this is what they do.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.380]   I think kinda, in my personal opinion,
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.860]   maybe you should, as an act of just doing a little bit extra
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.180]   go and make sure that you serve the Lord in this way,
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:21.020]   but I don't know.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.140]   That's the way they typically end their advice.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.300]   They'll say something great,
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.200]   like, you know, you should really actually
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.620]   take this as an opportunity
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.180]   to dedicate that part of yourself to God,
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.420]   and then they'll end it with,
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.060]   but I don't know, you just do what you need to do.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.900]   That's the way sometimes people talk,
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.860]   but I wanna challenge you, do not operate off of the fear,
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.180]   but operate off of this goal.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.780]   Actually, sometime recently,
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.260]   somebody just asked, out of curiosity,
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.220]   it wasn't like they were doing it,
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.580]   but they asked me, now that marijuana is legal,
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.420]   is it okay?
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.500]   Would you allow for, and I'm like,
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.700]   I'm not king of re-in, I'm just a dude,
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.340]   I'm like, would I allow it?
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.540]   But would I have something to say
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.700]   if someone smoked marijuana just for rest purposes?
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.900]   And I'm sitting there thinking,
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.260]   this is one of those scenarios where I had to kinda think,
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:19.380]   'cause I had a knee-jerk reaction,
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.900]   just been like, you're dumb,
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.980]   or something, right?
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:26.540]   But I had to think about it, so what would you say?
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.840]   What would you say, right?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.360]   But I think the best way to answer that is sometimes,
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.080]   if you're asking the question of just permissibility,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.840]   I'm not sure if that's the right question at all, is it?
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.880]   That's what this passage is saying to us.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.880]   Apostle Paul is working hard,
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.400]   and he wants you to know that he's working hard,
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.600]   and he wants you to know that he's sacrificing,
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.080]   and he wants you to know
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.640]   that he's literally being poured out like he's dying,
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.160]   and he has said, I bear on my body the suffering for you,
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.600]   because I want to present you holy and blameless,
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   complete in Christ,
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.840]   and then are you gonna go and ask Apostle Paul,
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.500]   but, but, do you think it's okay?
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.840]   So that I just, you know,
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.320]   like relax a little bit easier and better,
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.580]   and now, thank goodness, it's now legal.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:17.320]   You think that's the right question to ask Apostle Paul?
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.880]   And that's a challenge to us,
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.080]   because it's all about our standards.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.300]   We have a habit of lowering standards
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.220]   when it seems too high and big.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:33.060]   God's standard for us, his ambition and goal,
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.380]   do you understand what I'm saying, right?
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.840]   We all know in his perfect love,
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.140]   and in his perfect righteousness,
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.380]   is majestic, is beautiful,
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.120]   and is far beyond our capacities,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.660]   but we dare not, therefore, bring it down.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.820]   We say, I surrender to that.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.360]   Move in me, change me, work in me as you wish,
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.840]   so that I would continue to grow.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.760]   We dare not give counsel that's anything less.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.360]   We would be like those who pad people in their gluttonies,
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.960]   and okay this and that,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.840]   and it's almost like that scene where it's like,
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:13.480]   ooh, Hercules, Hercules, when the little kid is obese.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.060]   Why would you, do you know that reference?
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.240]   (laughing)
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.520]   Okay.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.480]   Let's bypass that one and move forward.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.480]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.800]   It's silly for us to,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.360]   in many ways, just pad people's emotions to say,
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.160]   that's okay, you know, we all,
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.240]   that's fine, that kind of thing,
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.200]   when we know that we are only contributing
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.160]   to sinful patterns or bad patterns
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.080]   that's going to lead to ruin.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.560]   Now, therefore, as we kind of move
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.120]   to the last verse in verse 29,
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.600]   I want to connect that to say,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.280]   the goal is high, the ambitions for ministry is huge,
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.060]   because it is of God,
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:56.960]   and therefore, it is actually purposed in the scriptures
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.840]   that it's not by your strength.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.600]   Right?
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.480]   Scripture tells to us in verse 29,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.640]   for this purpose also I labor,
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.800]   striving according to His power,
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.440]   which mightily works within me.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   And later, Apostle Paul said that we had to
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.960]   endure through affliction,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.800]   and we show our weakness in all this
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.240]   because it had to be made sure
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.520]   that this is of the will of God,
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.720]   and not by my flesh.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.380]   And the distinction I realize is,
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.000]   I wrestle with this all the time.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.080]   I want to preach a great sermon that's convicting to you.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.000]   I want to preach a sermon that's clear,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.220]   powerful, and really, really awesome, okay?
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.640]   But the thing about it is,
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.500]   I wrestle with that because,
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.840]   then if that's because of motivation, it could be skewed.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.180]   But because just the fact that I neglect to reference
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.260]   and give credit to God, it could be skewed.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.240]   And what I'm saying is,
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.000]   my desire, even though on paper it's clean,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.580]   it could actually go wrong in so many different ways, right?
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.700]   So how do we combat that?
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.880]   A lot of us has resorted to that I'm not gonna risk it.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.780]   I'm not gonna say something to you.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.400]   I'm not gonna preach here,
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.380]   and I'm not gonna do this,
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.900]   and that's called playing it safe.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.300]   But guess what?
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.480]   When you play it safe, that means you only play on the bench.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.240]   Basketball players who only play it safe
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.360]   don't get any playing time.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.760]   You're not useful, you're not fruitful.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.780]   What we need to do is not do the preaching,
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.220]   not do the exhortation, not do the admonishing.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.220]   No, what we need to do is not trust me.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.860]   I don't trust my voice to do the effect
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:39.100]   that we're talking about today.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.380]   It's always of faith,
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.940]   and therefore it's always of trust.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.220]   It's always of confidence,
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.380]   and it's always of hope of glory.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.680]   And that glory does not come because I did something.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.880]   The glory comes because the great mystery of Christ in you,
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.460]   the treasure of Christ, has been revealed.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:59.200]   And when we as a church see it
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.380]   and have so much confidence in it,
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:04.520]   then we could both have clarity and confidence in the work,
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.140]   but we also then hold out to hope,
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.420]   and we hold out to trust.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:12.900]   I believe that God will do his work in you.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.580]   And as weak as I am and as weak as you are,
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.520]   he is going to mature us.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.500]   We have people in our lives who are just like,
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.980]   I don't know that actually about them.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.260]   Sometimes you look at yourself and you say,
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.080]   I don't know that about me.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.220]   May I encourage your heart today.
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.480]   Christ is in you.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.600]   And the Savior whom the world was looking for
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.440]   to come and overthrow nations,
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   he is a Savior who can overthrow every nation.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.080]   He can overthrow every king,
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.040]   including the king that resides in your heart,
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:50.940]   the sinful king.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:53.520]   And every knee will bow,
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.480]   and every individual will lay down their crowns
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.520]   before our Messiah.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.280]   That powerful Messiah is in you.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.000]   And he is going to come.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.200]   And he says, he who began a good work will perfect it.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.920]   And therefore our ministry vision is actually glorious.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.960]   It's not just clear, it's not just good,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.440]   and it's not just loving.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   It's glorious, amen.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.340]   Let's take a moment to pray, everyone.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the ministry
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   that you have designed, you have empowered,
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.720]   and you have commissioned for us to do.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.240]   Father, I pray that we would not operate by fear,
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.500]   for that reveals that we were operating
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.800]   also by our own power.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.680]   Help us, Lord, to know you and your power.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.680]   Help us, Lord, to trust you and your grace.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.400]   Lord, we believe you, that you are doing a mighty work in us.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.960]   I want to walk with you, therefore, preaching your words,
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.920]   revealing your truth, and all the more loving Christ.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.840]   I thank you, Lord, for many of us here
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.920]   are recipients of that ministry.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.560]   Many saints before us have sacrificed.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.420]   A lot of us, even when we hear our testimonies,
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.560]   our parents have poured out their love,
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.860]   and we know that all of that, Lord God,
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.800]   is grace from your hand.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.080]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.320]   Well, this morning, as we think about
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.680]   the work of our Lord and his ministry,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.800]   we want to participate together in the communion.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.240]   So please take out the cups, and as you do,
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.320]   I would like to remind us of a special passage
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.160]   in the scriptures from 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.780]   that tells us that as we take of the communion,
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.960]   we want to take time to pray in remembrance of Christ
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.840]   and examination of self.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.360]   This passage comes to us from 1 Corinthians chapter 11,
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.840]   and it reads thus.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.380]   For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.200]   to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.820]   in which he was betrayed, took bread,
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.780]   and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.380]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.560]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.040]   In the same way, he took the cup also
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.680]   after supper, saying, "This is the cup
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.780]   "of the new covenant in my blood.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:11.280]   "Do this as often as you drink in remembrance of me.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.580]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:17.020]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:18.440]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.200]   "or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.840]   "shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.260]   "But a man must examine himself,
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.360]   "and in so doing, he is to eat of the bread
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.960]   "and drink of the cup.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.900]   "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.880]   "judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.440]   "For this reason, many among you are weak,
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.460]   "sick, and a number slumber.
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.660]   "But if we judged ourselves rightly,
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.160]   "we would not be judged."
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.980]   So, as you take of this cup,
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:52.480]   please take a moment now to pray,
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.720]   and if there is anything that you need
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.600]   the Lord to forgive you of,
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.880]   as you're walking in this earth,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.420]   our feet get dirty and we need to be washed.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.960]   Take time to pray.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.800]   But also, just simply pray in such gratitude,
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.720]   remembering all the work Christ has done in your life.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.980]   So, take a moment now to pray,
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.440]   and after a couple minutes,
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.300]   I will instruct us where together, in unison,
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.760]   we'll open up the elements,
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.040]   and then we will take part in it.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.960]   Take a moment to pray.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.880]   (soft piano music)
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   (praying in a foreign language)
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.800]   (soft piano music)
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   (praying in a foreign language)
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.720]   (soft piano music)
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.720]   (praying in a foreign language)
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.640]   (soft piano music)
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.640]   (praying in a foreign language)
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.560]   (soft piano music)
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:15:15.320]   At this time, please take your cups,
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.480]   and if you look, there's actually two layers
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.080]   on the top of the lid.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.480]   The first layer is clear,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.520]   and we'll unopen the piece of bread.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.400]   I wanna remind that being able to take this communion
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.220]   means that we have so desired to receive Christ's grace.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.600]   So, if you're not a believer here,
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.320]   and you haven't been baptized,
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.220]   please know that this is something unique
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.000]   as a means of remembrance and celebration
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.280]   for the Christian.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.400]   Please do observe and carefully think through
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.960]   who Christ is to you,
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.280]   as you observe this observing of the communion.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.040]   When you're ready, please go ahead and take the bread,
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:52.880]   and take a bit.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:59.840]   And then the second layer is the color layer,
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.200]   and you can take that and reveal the juice.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.160]   And when you're ready, please take a bit.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.640]   Amen.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.560]   Let's take a moment to join together in prayer.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.720]   Our God, we are so grateful to you again.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.640]   We dare not ever stop ceasing giving thanks to you.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.440]   For God, you have truly made the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.120]   And we know also that by your blood we come today.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.000]   Even after many years,
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.160]   Lord God, the effectiveness of your sacrifice
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.080]   did not waver at all.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.440]   But for all those who would believe
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.520]   we're able to come to you,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.560]   thank you for your grace.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.760]   Lord, you were broken in our place.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.040]   Father God, your life,
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:53.680]   Lord Jesus, your life was poured out for us in our place.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.040]   And Father, I pray, God, that truly,
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   if anything we are doing to grow and to learn,
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.280]   help us truly to grow in such faith,
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.440]   where we are so convinced that your heart of love
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.120]   accomplished the task that nobody can do.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.880]   And so Lord, this morning we wanna take time
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.760]   to render to you our gratitude,
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.560]   to offer to you our worship.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.880]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.200]   - Church family, let's all rise together

[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:50.480]   - Let us pray together as we close.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   Our God, Lord, we desire as a church together
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.560]   to be your ministers, to be your servants.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:04.360]   And so we pray as we hear this word from your book,
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.920]   challenging us to have this ambition
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:10.280]   to bear the burden of loving our brothers and sisters
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.640]   and desiring so eagerly that God,
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.560]   we would all grow in faith together,
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.640]   that we would spur each other on,
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.920]   maturing in every way.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.960]   But I pray, God, that we would do that like you would,
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.280]   but that we would speak as you would
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.680]   with great, great authority, yet at the same time,
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.400]   with great patience, great humility, and love.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.480]   And I pray that as we desire to live, to minister,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.560]   and to serve, reflecting Christ,
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.880]   that all of that would go to you in glory and thanksgiving.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.240]   We truly do trust you.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.200]   The grace that you have given to us is sufficient.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.960]   The gospel is power, and your word is true.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960]   And so I pray, God, that that would be
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.880]   our everlasting confidence.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.480]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.200]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.280]   blameless with great joy,
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.520]   for the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.520]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.640]   before all time and now and forever, amen.
