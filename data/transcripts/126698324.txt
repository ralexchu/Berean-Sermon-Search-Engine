[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   So, my name is Corinne and I recently graduated from college and I'm in the BAM group at Berean.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.480]   So I first started going to church when I was in the womb.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.760]   My parents were teachers at the high school group at my old church.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.880]   So I kind of like grew up in that environment where I went to church every single Sunday
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.160]   and Bible study every Friday night. As an elementary school student I would get like
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.320]   I would tag along to these high school retreats and I would just kind of be inundated with
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.000]   a lot of biblical teaching. But I think that instead of helping me to understand the gospel
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.720]   it just kind of puffed me up with pride. It kind of made me think that I knew everything
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.720]   there was to know about Christianity and I had this conception, this misconception that
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.960]   if I follow God's laws good enough, like better than the people I saw around me, then I could
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.600]   kind of do whatever I wanted with the rest of my life. And it kind of grew into this
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.520]   feeling of moral superiority that like, "Hey, I know all these things about the Bible."
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.880]   The time when my idea that I was morally superior to everybody else, it kind of started falling
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.200]   apart around my senior year of high school. There were kind of three things that happened
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.360]   that God used to kind of break me to the point where I realized that I needed Christ. The
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.040]   first one, I ran into these two girls on my high school campus that were, they were basically
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.160]   evangelizing and they came up to me and I saw them gripping their Bibles and they were
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.560]   all happy and I was like, "I do not want to deal with this right now." They asked me,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.200]   "Oh, do you know who Jesus Christ is?" And I was like, "Yeah, I go to church and I'm
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.920]   saved." And so one of the girls, um, dared to press a little bit further and I'm really
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.840]   grateful to her for this, but she asked, "Well, how do you know that you're saved?" And the
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.400]   first thing that wanted to come out of my mouth was, "Oh, because I go to church." But
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.600]   then the youth pastor, Maria, the Sunday before had said, "Well, just because you go to church
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.720]   doesn't mean you're a Christian." And as it was coming, as the answer was coming out of
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.800]   my mouth, I was like, "This is wrong." I actually, I couldn't for the life of me think of a reason
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.360]   why I was saved. And so that kind of got me thinking, like, maybe I'm actually not saved.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.680]   The second thing, like, broke down my idea that I was morally superior was, um, I started
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.120]   going out with a boy my senior year of high school and, um, we kind of quickly started
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.120]   into a more physical relationship and there are a lot of things that happened that, um,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   that kind of left me with regrets. Like, growing up in a Christian household, I knew what I
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.560]   was doing was wrong, but the scary thing was that I couldn't stop. It was kind of devastating
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.680]   because I spent my whole life thinking that I was, I was morally superior to everybody
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.720]   else, that I had, that I was good with God because I followed His law, but here I was,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.400]   I couldn't follow His law for the life of me. Um, and so I think that kind of set me
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.080]   up for the third thing that God introduced into my life, which was an argument with my
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   mom over my, um, my then boyfriend. And she, um, was blunt with me and she called me out
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   and she told me, "Hey, you're a sinner." And, um, I was like, "Oh my gosh, how dare you?"
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.880]   But I knew she was right. And she said, "Hey, you're a sinner and you can't stop sinning
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.240]   on your own." She told me that the whole point of Christianity is not to be good enough because
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.560]   you can never be good enough, um, for God's standards. But the point of Christianity and
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.080]   the point of a relationship with Christ is to accept that I'm a sinner and I can't possibly
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.240]   reach God's standards, um, but that I have to trust that Jesus' death and resurrection
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:09.760]   paid for this sin. And, um, and I can do nothing, I can't add nothing to that. And I think that's
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.240]   the, I think that's the first time when I really understood what grace meant, is that
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:27.000]   I can add nothing to my own salvation. I can't do anything, um, on my own apart from Christ.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   So what my mom said kind of stuck with me, um, and I, I got saved at a Berean retreat
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.360]   the summer right before I started college. I came before God and I said, "God, if you,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.680]   if you exist, then I really need you to cover my sin with your Son's blood because I can't
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.280]   do it on my own." God gave me a desire to want to do His will and want to obey Him.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.640]   And I'm really grateful to God that He saved me before going to college because that kind
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.280]   of set me on the right path to grow a lot more. He placed me at, um, at a very strong
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.400]   church in a very strong fellowship group, uh, UCLA. Um, God just put me in a really
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.000]   healthy place where I could, um, fellowship with believers my age who, who love the Lord
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.680]   and want to pursue Christ. And, uh, there's still many brothers and sisters who are running
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.880]   this race right alongside me and who are there to encourage me and, um, to hold me accountable
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.560]   in my sin. And yeah, I'm, I'm, I feel again very blessed that God has placed me in a healthy
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.520]   environment, um, where, uh, I have believers around me to, um, encourage me and to push
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.440]   me, um, towards Christ.
