[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   - All right, good morning.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   We have a few announcements that we need to get to first.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   First of all, our Korea mission team
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   that's gonna be going out to reach out
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.520]   to campuses in Seoul in about three weeks.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   They have a sweatshirt fundraiser that's happening
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   that'll help support what we're doing.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520]   So they have a table outside.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   I'm not sure if they have pictures there,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   but you can buy in faith or you can ask them for a picture
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   or whatever design that they have.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   But again, to support them, so I think the cost is $45
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   and there's gonna be a table set up outside
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   so you can go visit that.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.520]   And you can ask them, the people are there,
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.520]   about the specifics of what's going on for that ministry.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.520]   So that will be set up outside.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   Along with that, this week and next week,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   we are continuing to collect the missions offerings
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.520]   that we ask that you would be prayerful
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   about supporting the mission work
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   that's happening through the IMB.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   In particular, Pastor Alex and his family
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   that we went to Taiwan to support his church.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   And so the offering that comes in will be sent over there.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   So please, if you are giving today or next week,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.520]   that you mark clearly that this is
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   for Ladi Moon mission offering.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   Okay, Christmas mission offering.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.520]   And then we'll be able to designate that
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.520]   and send that over when we get it.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Again, this week and next Sunday, okay?
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   WBBA sign-ups.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   If you are gonna be playing basketball,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   please sign up for that.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.520]   Today is absolutely the last day to sign up.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   They are going to be making teams this afternoon.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   So if you wait till tonight, it will be too late.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   So please sign up for that for the ladies and the men.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   There's a table outside.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.520]   If you haven't signed up, you're planning to sign up,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   please do so after the service, okay?
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   Next Sunday, Christmas service.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   Obviously, it's gonna be a lot of guests
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   that are gonna be coming into town.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.520]   The children are gonna be performing.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.520]   And there is going to be a table for the seekers.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.520]   So if you are bringing somebody
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.520]   that you're trying to share the gospel with,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   there's going to be a table set up outside
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   so you can answer any questions.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.520]   Pastor Mark and the outreach team
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.520]   is going to be stationed there.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.520]   It's between each of the service.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   So after first, second, and third service,
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   depending on which service you come to,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   you can visit that table,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.520]   and you'll be able to get more attention.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   Just wanted to give you a hands-up.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   We have more space in the first service, right?
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   And so second service, obviously, is gonna be packed.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   We think that third service is also going to be pretty busy.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.520]   So if you want more attention than normal,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.520]   first service, you go to first service.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   So there's less people, so you get much more attention.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   So if you're bringing somebody
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.520]   and you're choosing which one to go to,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   we encourage you to go to the first service, okay?
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   [laughs]
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   Hopefully it works, okay.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   New Year's Eve service, at the end of the year,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   we typically, as a church, get together,
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   and we celebrate the new year that's coming in,
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   and it's an act of giving the first fruit of our time
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   together with our families.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   And I know that people who have small children
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   may have a difficult time coming to that,
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   but if you are able to,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.520]   we have a service at 11 o'clock
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.520]   that we usually finish around 1215, 1220,
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.520]   and again, we celebrate the new year,
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   and again, as a dedication,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   it's more of a dedication service
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   for the new year that's coming.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.520]   We do this every year, but along with that,
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.520]   there's a ping-pong tournament
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   that usually happens prior to for the activity,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   and there will be games on the cafe side,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   so if you want to come and not play ping-pong
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   and you want to do that, the church will be open
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   pretty much most of the day that day,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   but if you are planning to play,
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   I think it's only doubles tournament,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.440]   you can do that outside.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   So you don't have to be an expert.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   You don't have to be number one.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   You can be number 20.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   So you can go and sign up just to have fun, okay?
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   So that will be happening here,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   so please sign up for that if you are planning to,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   and it will be stationed outside.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   And then finally, our Bible study
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   has officially ended for this session.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   Next session is going to start on February 5th,
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   and the topic that we're going to be covering
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.440]   is hermeneutics.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   So Pastor Mark is going to be teaching us
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.440]   how to study inductively
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   through the various genres in the Bible,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   so whether it's a narrative,
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   whether it's poetic,
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   whether it's prophetic or the epistles,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.440]   he's going to be giving us certain passages
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.440]   to work through, so there will be text
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.440]   that we are going to be working through,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.440]   but we're hoping that the church
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.440]   would be better suited
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   to be able to tackle not only the epistles
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   but the narratives in the Old Testament
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   because certain principles
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   don't apply to different genres, right?
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.440]   How we interpret a narrative,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   how we interpret, you know,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   like parables is not the same way
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   that we would approach an epistle,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   and so Pastor Mark is going
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.440]   to give a 10-week session.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   It's going to start on February 5th,
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   and it'll be ending at the end of April,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.440]   so it'll be 10 weeks, not 13 weeks,
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   and part of the reason why we're doing that
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   is we're trying to save the summertime.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   There's going to be a long break during the summer
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   and not regular home groups,
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   so the home group's going to take a break,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   but there's going to be different topical sessions
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.360]   that are offered during the summertime,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   so in order to do that,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   we're giving more time during the summer,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   and we've shortened the Bible study
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   just to give you a heads-up, okay?
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   So if you are able to,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   if you're a member of the church,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   please sign up for this.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   Even if you are committed
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   to the same home group
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   for the last four or five years,
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   we need you to sign up
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   so that we can know for sure
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   that we have enough space,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.360]   we need you to find space,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   so if you are part of that,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.360]   please sign up as soon as possible,
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   and that will help us to know
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   if we need to add two or three more small groups
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   or Bible study, so that will help us, okay?
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   So if you can do that as soon as possible,
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   the table to sign up for that is also outside, okay?
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   All right, let me pray for us
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   for the offering,
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   and then afterwards, again,
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   we'll begin our worship.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   Let's pray.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   Gracious Father,
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   it is a privilege that we have
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   to be able to come week after week
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   to worship you,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   to meet with you,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   to be fed by you.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   Help us to lift our eyes toward Christ,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   to know, Father,
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   that this is where our help comes from.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   Lord, you know how easily
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   we get distracted and entangled
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   and anxiety and concerns
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   creep into our hearts.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   I pray that this worship will serve
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.360]   to focus our attention on Christ,
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.360]   I pray that all that we do
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   will be an overflow of gratitude
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   of everything that you've already given us,
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   and I pray that even this offering
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   may reflect our worship to you
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   and may it be multiplied
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.360]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.900]   And he was saying to them,
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.140]   "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.720]   Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.420]   to send out laborers into his harvest.

[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.820]   'Peace be to this house.'
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.500]   If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him,
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.540]   but if not, it will return to you.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.060]   Say in that house, eating and drinking what they give you,
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.180]   for the laborer is worthy of his wages.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.600]   Do not keep moving from house to house.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.140]   Whatever city you enter and they receive you,
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.020]   eat what is set before you,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.740]   and heal those in it who are sick,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.240]   and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.800]   Whatever city you enter and they do not receive you,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.120]   go out into its streets and say,
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.580]   'Even the dust of your city, which clings to our feet,
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.900]   we wipe off in protest against you.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.880]   Yet be sure of this,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.440]   that the kingdom of God has come near you.'"
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.280]   Let's pray.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.960]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.560]   We pray for conviction.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.660]   We pray, Lord God, that we would gain
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   more than simple knowledge of this text,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.700]   but our own hearts may be molded as you are the potter
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.820]   and we are the clay.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.560]   Help us, Lord God, as we have come to draw near to you,
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.240]   that you would speak to us, guide us, and lead us.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:09.180]   At our church, I know some of you guys
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.660]   who are newer to the church,
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.700]   and some people have been here,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.700]   and I remember just this week,
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.340]   Esther and I sat and we kind of tabulated
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.760]   how many people do we have still in our church
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.820]   that was with us from the very beginning.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.500]   And really, there's only like two,
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.180]   two or three from the beginning,
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.460]   and then you go two years after that,
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.000]   there's maybe about eight or nine that's added,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.060]   and then the four years after that,
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.180]   four or five years after that,
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.880]   we have maybe about 30 people, 40 people,
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.700]   and then we were just kind of reminiscing about that,
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.720]   because our 28th year anniversary
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   is coming up in about four years,
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.940]   and we were thinking about how God has been faithful to us
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.140]   and brought us to this journey,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.580]   and one of the things that I kind of was thinking about
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.700]   early on in the church,
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.600]   trying to figure out how you're supposed to run a church,
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.780]   because I know we have a handful of people in our church
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.620]   who've been to seminary,
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.580]   but seminary doesn't teach you how to run a church.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.980]   You spend three years basically
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.060]   learning how to dissect the Greek text
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.140]   and then the Hebrew and church history,
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.780]   but they don't teach you the practical things
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.320]   of how to manage money, what to do with small group,
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   even how to disciple people.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.040]   What do you do when the church is 100?
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.440]   What do you do when the church is 200?
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.780]   What do you do when the church is 1,000?
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.520]   This is something that we just kind of learn as we go,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.600]   so I remember early on thinking,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.440]   maybe I should just get as many books
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.760]   about church as possible,
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.880]   and then read it and see,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   maybe the people have gone before us
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.800]   and I can glean some wisdom from them,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.840]   and so I got as many popular books on church planting
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.260]   and church management books as I could,
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.600]   and I remember after reading,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.080]   and I can't remember how many,
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.680]   but I was so interested in this subject
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.400]   because there was a dire need,
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.420]   reading maybe 10, 15 books in a row,
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.640]   and there was a consistent theme that kept on coming up,
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.080]   and a few of the things that I remember is,
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.280]   to don't plant a church
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.080]   unless you have a critical mass of 30.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.320]   In other words, if you want, from their study,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.960]   if you planted a church that has less than 30 people,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.420]   the chances of it being successful is very slim,
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.520]   so don't even begin
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.400]   until you can gather a core of 30 people.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.320]   Make sure that you have a specific target group.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.420]   Who are you targeting?
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.080]   Are you targeting older people, younger people?
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.520]   What economic status?
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.560]   What ethnicity?
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.040]   And so you need to have a clear target
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.480]   'cause if you're going to develop a church
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.240]   that's going to meet their needs,
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   you need to know who you're targeting
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.080]   and to develop a church to meet those needs.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.920]   Make sure that you have funding to last about three years
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.840]   to pay for the church rental for yourself,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.160]   for your children,
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.460]   and make sure you have at least three,
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.760]   so give yourself at least three years.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.600]   So if you don't have funding for three years,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.040]   that is probably, the chances of success
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.680]   is going to be very small.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.920]   Another thing that they said
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.040]   was location, location, location.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.320]   So if you've ever had businesses,
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.800]   again, I think it's a little bit different now
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.320]   because you have online presence
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.120]   and people have Yelp that they look up
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.520]   and they go to gang-infested areas to get $1 tacos.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.760]   So now maybe that principle may have changed,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.400]   but back then, if you want to have a successful business,
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.560]   you have to put it into a good location.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.180]   And so they would say, even the church,
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.640]   if you're going to be successful,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.480]   you have to make sure that you choose a church
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.360]   where it's easily accessible
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.740]   and just like any other business,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.160]   location, location, location.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.680]   But the thing that stood out to me the most
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.560]   was that they said, if you planted a church
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.920]   and it doesn't succeed,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.560]   that it doesn't grow,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.480]   after two years,
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.160]   the chances of your church growing is very slim.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.520]   And the reason why that stood out to me
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.640]   is 'cause I read that fifth year into our church
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.560]   and our church didn't grow.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.120]   You know, we'd have one visitor per year
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.320]   and we would say revival, you know, and everybody,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.440]   you know, we didn't need a welcome team
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.900]   because the whole church went after that one person
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.380]   and that one person was Pastor Mark Lim.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.020]   So when he came to our church, he was loved
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.700]   because he was the one guy that visited that year,
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.500]   you know, and he stuck around this whole time.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   Now I say all of this because at the end of this,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.020]   it felt so empty,
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.460]   but these are the people who went before me
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.620]   and these are the churches supposedly that were successful.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.420]   And then I ran across one book
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.100]   because somebody referred this to me.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.040]   And it's no frills, no illustration.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.300]   It was just green paperback.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.140]   And the title of it was "The Church."
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.680]   And the author of it was Dr. Clowney
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.460]   from Westminster Seminary.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.820]   And so that's all I knew.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.460]   So they recommended it, I started reading it,
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.460]   and right off the bat, it just opened my eyes
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.220]   'cause all he did was this is what the Bible says
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.340]   and this is what you're supposed to do.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.100]   This is what the text says, this is what you do.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.260]   And so it was about 300 pages
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.980]   of just going through scripture after scripture
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.100]   after scripture.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.860]   And I know that we've been reading
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.820]   "The Master's Plan for the Church,"
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.740]   and maybe some of you think it's too dense,
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.260]   but this is the seminary version of that, right?
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.180]   No frills, just text, and 300 pages of Bible says this,
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.460]   Bible says this, Bible says that.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.260]   I learned more from that one book
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.700]   than all the other books that I've read.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.220]   Coming out thinking like this is what God expects
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.100]   from the church, this is why he planted the church,
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.300]   this is what he was supposed to do with leadership.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.860]   And so that was very helpful to me early on in church
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.460]   that this is what God desired.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.940]   And if there's one thing that I learned in 28 years
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.000]   of being at this church is,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.220]   it is absolutely crystal clear to me
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:46.060]   that God's desire for us as a church,
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.980]   and any church, and any Christian,
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.620]   is that he is seeking his own glory.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.260]   Now, some of you who may not be used to hearing
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.620]   that may think, well, that kind of sounds egotistical.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.460]   But only when God is glorified do we live,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.140]   because he's our source of life.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.460]   So when he is glorified,
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.160]   everything that he has created benefits from that.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.000]   When we are glorified, it leads to rebellion.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.020]   So what God desires more than anything else
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.380]   from his church is that God is exalted.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.260]   When God is exalted, the light is bright,
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   and people become saved, the debt basically is raised.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.260]   Now, in order to put Christ as the head of the church,
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.500]   we can't just have his name and hanging a cross
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.900]   in the church doesn't mean that Christ is at the center.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.380]   In order for Christ to be established at the center,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.420]   we need to follow his direction, which is his word.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.420]   This is why we named our church Berean Community Church,
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.700]   because everything must be tested
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.660]   according to the word of God.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.860]   We don't simply do anything just because of tradition.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.500]   We don't simply do something because, you know,
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.120]   the church down the street said they did it,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.420]   and it worked for them.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.620]   They did this, and so many people came.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.900]   So we've always said this,
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.620]   and you will hear this in our membership class.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.420]   Everything we do, we have to have a biblical base.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.020]   Why does he do this, and what does he tell us to do, right?
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.860]   Now, why I say all of this is because
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.580]   the text that we're in, Jesus is training his disciples
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.700]   to go church planting, to evangelize.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.200]   And so last week, we saw four principles
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.440]   in the first four verses.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.560]   One is the sending out of the 70,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.800]   it signifies that every single person
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.440]   was called to the harvest.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.920]   So the 12 that were called in the beginning of chapter nine,
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.280]   12 apostles were preparing them,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.120]   but then in chapter 10, he calls the 70
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.760]   who represents the nation of Israel.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.000]   In other words, we've all been called
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.320]   to go to be proclaimers of the gospel.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.240]   Number two, when he sends us to the harvest,
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.040]   there will never be a time where the harvest
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.880]   is going to be lesser than the workers.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.520]   Harvest is plentiful, and the workers are few.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.940]   There's never been a time in church history
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.400]   where we had more workers than the work to do.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.200]   If somebody says there's no work to be done,
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.900]   something already is off in the way that he's thinking.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.040]   There will never be a time, and if that day ever comes,
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.920]   when the workers outnumber the harvest,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.560]   the Bible says that he will come.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.520]   So there will always be work to do.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.440]   Number three, if you go out proclaiming the kingdom of God
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.640]   and the good news of the gospel,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.200]   he says there will be opposition.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.360]   Opposition doesn't come because we've gathered together
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.680]   to worship and because we're helping the homeless
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.560]   and we're doing good deeds.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.280]   Opposition comes because we're proclaiming
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.920]   the kingdom of God.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.360]   He says I'm sending you out as lambs among wolves.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.920]   So he says sending you out.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.080]   So if you don't go out, you're not gonna understand
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.680]   what he means by that.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.760]   They will hate you because they hated me.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.680]   They will reject you because they rejected me.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.540]   That happens when you go.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.440]   That doesn't mean that you have to pack up your bags
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.580]   and go to remote parts of the world,
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.080]   but if you're actively engaged in taking the gospel
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.000]   to darkness, it's like turning on the light
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.800]   in a world that doesn't want the light turned on.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.120]   And so there's going to be opposition.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.600]   Fourthly, he says, the Lord of the harvest is God himself.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.780]   So before you try to figure out strategies
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.080]   and how to do this better, he says,
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.980]   beseech the Lord of the harvest,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.080]   that he would send out more workers,
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.680]   that ultimately we are dependent on him.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.880]   He is our sovereign God, and so if you see the great need
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.120]   and you feel overwhelmed by the work that needs to be done,
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.040]   he says get on your knees and pray
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.120]   that God would send out more laborers for his kingdom.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.920]   So this week's text is gonna take us
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.840]   to three more principles that we see.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   Number four, the fourth principle of church planting
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.360]   in the Great Commission, he says to go wherever he sends you,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.680]   wherever he sends you.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.600]   Now, this may sound like, you know, like no duh,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.720]   but when he sent the 70, he didn't pick and choose
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.160]   and say, you know, if you go to this place,
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.520]   these people are gonna be receptive,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.160]   and then you go in there, enjoy your time,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.720]   establish a church, and go to this city
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.240]   'cause they're waiting for you to come.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.720]   He tells them, when you go,
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.200]   some people are gonna receive you,
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.160]   some people are gonna reject you.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.480]   Some people are gonna take care of you,
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.120]   some people are just gonna chase you out.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.080]   Shake up your dust and move on.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.160]   But we don't have a choice to say, you know what,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.000]   I wanna go here and I wanna go there.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.600]   No, typically when we think of ministry,
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.260]   when people say, you know, I wanna go and do God's work,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.920]   you know, a lot of times we think of
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.240]   even Apostle Paul's ministry,
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.520]   even the early disciples' ministry,
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.920]   that even if there's hardship,
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.840]   I'm gonna sacrifice, I'm gonna plant churches,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.800]   and even if I get martyred, I'm gonna do this,
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.420]   if you're very committed.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.520]   But very few people think that they're gonna have
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.820]   a ministry of Jeremiah, the weeping prophet.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.580]   If you look at the calling of Isaiah,
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.720]   after God reveals his glory to him,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.480]   touches his mouth to prepare him
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.760]   so that he would be the spokesperson for him to Israel,
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.640]   this is what he says in Isaiah 6, 8 through 11,
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.840]   "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   "Whom shall I send and who will go for us?"
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.400]   Then Isaiah responds and says, "Here am I, send me,"
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.820]   he said, "Go and tell this people."
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.380]   Now, that's the calling of anybody
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.520]   who wants to do ministry, and again,
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   we've already established that this is not just the pastors,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.760]   it's not just the elders, it's not just the missionaries.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.520]   This general call is for all Christians.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.140]   Who will go?
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.540]   And so every Christian, when you have accepted Christ
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.300]   as your Lord and Savior, has committed that in some way,
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.820]   maybe not physically go to another country,
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.460]   but that we are going to be the light,
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.140]   we are going to be the salt wherever it is
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.820]   that God places us.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.780]   So we have all said, "Here am I, send me."
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.020]   But we have a tendency to think that,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.260]   when I say, "Here am I, send me,"
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.980]   say, "Here am I, send me to this place,
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.480]   "with this people, with this support,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.380]   "and with people who are gonna respond to me this way."
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.980]   Look what he says.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.460]   He said, "I'm gonna send you, go and tell this people,
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.620]   "keep on listening and do not perceive,
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.320]   "keep on looking, but do not understand."
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.780]   In other words, what he is saying is,
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.220]   "I'm gonna send you to these people
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.100]   "who have a pattern of rejecting my word.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.840]   "I've sent other prophets to them,
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.660]   "and they've kept on hardening their heart.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.480]   "And I'm gonna send you to them
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.020]   "and to continue to do what they've been doing."
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.980]   And then he follows up by saying,
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.340]   "Render the hearts of this people insensitive."
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.180]   Now, how is he rendering their hearts insensitive?
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.160]   Is he just commanding, he's like,
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.900]   "Lord, pray that their hearts will be hardened.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.860]   "I'm praying that their ears will be closed,
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.020]   "so that if I preach to them,
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.780]   "that the people who would have listened
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.620]   "aren't gonna listen."
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.740]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.580]   No, he said, "These people have a pattern.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.560]   "They keep rejecting me.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.200]   "And if you go and continue to preach to them,
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.200]   "what I'm telling you, your message of warning,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.460]   "because they're gonna harden their hearts,
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.400]   "your preaching is gonna cause their hearts
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.880]   "to be even more hardened.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.440]   "They might render their hearts to the people insensitive,
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.940]   "their ears dull, their eyes dim.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.160]   "Otherwise, they might see with their eyes,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.200]   "hear with their ears, understand with their hearts,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.420]   "and return and be healed."
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.040]   Now, this is a warning for anybody
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.780]   who goes to church on a regular basis
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.900]   and hears the gospel and refuses to submit.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.100]   You know what to do.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.740]   You know where God is poking at, and you refuse.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.740]   So after you've been listening to the message of God,
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.060]   week after week, year after year,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:51.060]   and after years of refusing to submit to God,
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.820]   you have become much more dull of hearing.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.820]   Your heart has become much more harder
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.940]   because you've already set a pattern
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.820]   that this is something that I'm not gonna do.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.300]   You've just excused that these are things that,
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.620]   you know, these are things that I'm gonna do,
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.980]   and these are things that I'm not gonna get at,
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.420]   and I just don't want anybody to touch that.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.460]   Now, I feel uncomfortable,
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.780]   and then you just kind of forget about it
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.060]   as soon as the sermon is over.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.980]   And if that's a pattern that you're used to,
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.780]   he says, "Continue to preach to them
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.860]   "because your preaching is going to
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.300]   "render their hearts hardened."
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.940]   They're gonna become even more blind.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.440]   So whenever the word of God is preached accurately,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.460]   two things happen.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.100]   Your hearts become melted,
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.780]   and you become, you draw closer to God,
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.820]   or the next time you hear,
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.220]   it's gonna have a less and less impact on you.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.380]   And he says to Isaiah to go and do this.
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.540]   Now, who wants to sign up for this, right?
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.500]   I wanna go, and even if I get persecuted,
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.540]   I wanna see fruits.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.300]   I wanna see people come to Christ, churches planted.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.140]   So Isaiah asked the same question
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.220]   that every one of us would be asking in verse 11.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.100]   Then I said, "Lord, how long?"
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.160]   How long do you want me to do this?
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.900]   He answered, "Until the cities are devastated
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.360]   "and without inhabitants, houses are without people,
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.160]   "and the land is utterly desolate."
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.480]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.240]   Isaiah goes and preaches, their hearts become hardened.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.880]   They say, man, that guy, every time he opens his mouth,
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.880]   he brings condemnation, and he warns them,
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.360]   and warns them, and warns them for 40 years.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.680]   At the end of 40 years, the Babylonians come
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.840]   and take them into captivity,
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.080]   and everything that God warned them about
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.960]   happens exactly the way Isaiah told them.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   So why did God send Isaiah to begin with
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.400]   if they weren't gonna listen?
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.200]   If you look at the pattern in the Old Testament
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.640]   and New Testament, God always leaves a witness.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.240]   That even if they don't understand,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.440]   at some point, maybe years later,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.280]   they might look back at that and say,
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.140]   "God sent a true prophet among us,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.680]   "a Jeremiah, a weeping prophet.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.360]   "All his life, he was weeping,
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.040]   "and they never recognized him."
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.540]   It wasn't until decades later they looked back and said,
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.460]   "Jeremiah was a true prophet,
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.640]   "and everybody else who was telling us."
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.140]   Even if it was not for them,
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.080]   it was for their future generation
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.860]   that God left a witness so that they would recognize
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.620]   who was speaking for God.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.440]   You and I do not have a choice as a servant
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.960]   to pick and choose where and who and what we say.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.840]   If we're servants of God, we go where he tells us to go.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   We say what he tells us to say.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.880]   We do what he tells us to do.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.300]   Otherwise, you're not a servant.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.680]   A servant doesn't pick and choose and say,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.920]   "Give us the commandments,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.480]   "and then let me see what I can do."
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.660]   That's not a servant.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.760]   A servant is somebody who says, "Tell me what to do,"
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.280]   and whatever he says, you do.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.480]   That's the first principle,
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.800]   is that we don't have to be so smart
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.200]   if we're simply obeying.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.040]   We don't have to be sophisticated.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.660]   We don't have to have years and years of training
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.440]   in order to bear fruit.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.040]   In fact, one of the most tangible evidence
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.400]   that I've seen this is out in India,
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.720]   we're gonna take a team out in about a month,
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.920]   and Pastor Matthew, who was the guy
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.480]   who started this ministry out here in India,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.920]   I asked him, "What was ministry like?"
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.280]   Because he was a former Hindu priest who converted,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.320]   and literally no education, no seminary background.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.320]   He just became a Christian, was handed a Bible,
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.920]   and he just started reading,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.800]   and he's just following just what it said.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.280]   So I asked him, so he doesn't have training,
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.720]   he doesn't have seminary, he doesn't know anything,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.400]   any creeks, never read any book.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.800]   He just became a Christian and decided to obey,
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.440]   and he had three young children.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.080]   Eventually, he had a baby girl.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.680]   But three young boys with his wife,
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.480]   with a young family, just took them and said,
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.840]   "Just went out to the villages,"
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.500]   'cause he knew that they didn't hear the gospel.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.560]   So I asked him, "What was it like?"
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.040]   And he said he would go to the villages,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.600]   and he would share the gospel,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.800]   and some of the people who came to Christ during that time
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.640]   are still there working with him.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.020]   And he said, "I would go preach the gospel,
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.200]   "and if they would receive me, they would feed us."
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.280]   I said, "Oh, they feed."
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.680]   So what happened when they didn't receive?
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.040]   He said, "We couldn't eat."
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.480]   So how did you sleep?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.320]   How did you take care?
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.360]   'Cause sometimes it would take two days
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.440]   of walking into the village,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.200]   so they can't just come back out.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.040]   So what happened?
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.300]   He said, "We would just sleep out in the field,
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.400]   "and I couldn't feed the kids."
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.200]   And he said that that burden of seeing his kids suffer,
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.300]   it's one thing for him to suffer,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.520]   but seeing his kids to suffer,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.400]   he said it caused him depression early on in ministry.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.440]   And he said that he even had suicidal thoughts,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.400]   and said, "Maybe if I died, this burden
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.560]   "to preach the gospel would be lifted from our home,
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.940]   "and my kids wouldn't have to suffer."
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.880]   So I'm hearing this, it's like, "Is this real?
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.360]   "Does this guy actually do this?"
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.440]   So I went and talked to his children,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.640]   who are grownups now, they're in their early 50s.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.120]   And I asked them, "What was your childhood like
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.640]   "when your dad was preaching the gospel?"
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.040]   And he said, "We hated it."
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.000]   He said, "I remember when we would just sleep
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.680]   "out in the fields, and we had nothing to eat.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.800]   "And we were so angry with my father,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.640]   "'cause he would drag us into these villages,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.780]   "and then sometimes we would eat,
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.580]   "and sometimes we'd be out in the village.
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.880]   "Or if not, we would just find some potatoes
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.720]   "or something out in the field, and we would eat that.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.080]   "And sometimes we'd just sleep out in the open,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.880]   "and sometimes we'd be in people's houses."
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.520]   And he said, "That's how they planted churches."
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.120]   Right now, they have over 2,000 people
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.840]   that they're overseeing, over 200 churches
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.760]   that these 40, 50 pastors are overseeing.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.080]   And they're still couldn't even preach the gospel.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.840]   How were they able to be so successful?
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.000]   It just happened that God chose somebody so smart
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.320]   that he had some sort of skill,
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.020]   maybe something special about him?
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:01.500]   No, he just read the Bible and just followed what it said.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:09.600]   The church in its purest form, that's what it looks like.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.860]   When we're not so sophisticated with all our education
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.840]   and all our know-how, somehow all the stuff
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   that we have gained actually hinders us.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.320]   And we have more confidence in our education
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.680]   and our knowledge than the power of God.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   That's why we have a church that is so well-educated
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.100]   that doesn't pray.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.960]   We know so much.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.000]   We know how to do church.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   We know how to write books.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.440]   We know how to run seminars, 'cause we've read so much,
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.840]   heard so many sermons.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.440]   We have so little confidence in the power of God.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.600]   All he said was, "Do not turn from my word to the left
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.140]   "or to the right.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.760]   "Read it and do exactly as I say.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.300]   "If I tell you to pick up this box
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.080]   "and run around this city seven times, just do it.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.660]   "If I tell you to take up a staff
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.080]   "and just put it over your head, just do it."
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.280]   So why, how is this gonna,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.020]   what does this have to do with fighting an army?
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.680]   What is this, how is this box gonna help us?
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.600]   He says, "Have I not commanded you?
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.100]   "Be strong and courageous.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.160]   "Do not turn from my word to the left or to the right.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.360]   "You shall meditate it on a day and night,
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.440]   "and you will have success."
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.540]   That principle wasn't just given to the nation of Israel.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.600]   It is no different in the New Testament.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:35.140]   If you wanna bear fruit, he says to abide in me.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.680]   Not figure out the new technique,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.800]   not find out what's the latest things
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.400]   that we can apply to the church,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.200]   but abide in me, abide in me, listen to me.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.820]   Do not turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.720]   That's why he says,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.280]   "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.720]   In season, out of season basically means
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.520]   whether they listen or don't listen.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.780]   Whether it works or don't work.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:04.700]   Because even Jesus wasn't fruitful everywhere he went.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.080]   Even the apostles were not fruitful everywhere he went.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.680]   So it is our pride and arrogance
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.000]   that we think that if we apply our know-how,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.160]   our giftedness, and we apply it in the right way
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.780]   to the right people with right funding,
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.920]   with right organization,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.320]   that we can be fruitful everywhere all the time.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:25.060]   He says, "No, preach the word in season and out of season,
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.440]   "whether they come or don't come,
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.600]   "whether they leave thanking you,
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.000]   "whether they leave hating you."
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.200]   He said, "Don't turn from my word
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.360]   "to the left or to the right.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   "You go and you say and you do what I tell you to do, period."
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.120]   Doesn't that make ministry simple?
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.720]   You're just as equipped as I am
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.120]   because you have the same access to this God that I do.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.220]   Oh, but you went to seminary,
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.720]   you have 30-some years of being a Christian
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.640]   and you've read so many things,
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.840]   you have so much experience.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.200]   But you have the exact same access to God that I do.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.320]   You have the same access to the word of God that I do.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.960]   The only benefit that I, maybe,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   is because maybe I know the Bible better than some of you
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.820]   and I know maybe this is what God says,
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.760]   maybe better than some of you.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.880]   But outside of that,
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.680]   you have the exact same access to the exact same God.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.000]   'Cause the power is not within me.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.460]   My experience, my know-how is with him.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.180]   We go where he tells us to go.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.720]   And it was interesting, again,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.040]   and I asked his son, Pastor Saki,
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.360]   he's the guy that I have relationship with
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.480]   and calls us to go to India.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.600]   And I said, "You know, with all the persecution coming in,
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.480]   "how do you plant churches in these remote villages
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.340]   "when they're so hostile to you?
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:43.460]   "So when they throw rocks at you, what do you do?"
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.260]   In the Western church, he said, "Oh, they're not welcoming.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.840]   "Typically, we think the door's not open
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.180]   "if they make fun of us."
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.940]   Get that crazy foreign God out of your,
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.080]   oh, that door's closed.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.400]   I said, "What do you do when you go in there
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.740]   "and they start throwing rocks at you?"
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.140]   And they said, "We leave."
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.460]   Very simple.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.300]   He said, "We just leave."
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.340]   "And then what do you do?"
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.300]   He said, "We wait 'til they calm down.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.160]   "And then when they calm down, we go back.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.700]   "And then if somebody believes, then we plant a church."
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.820]   He said, "That's how churches get planted over here."
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.260]   That's it?
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.380]   Yeah, he said.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.600]   And he was looking at me, he's like,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.500]   "What do you wanna hear?"
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.820]   We're just doing what it says.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.800]   And it's like, wow, you're right.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.640]   You're right.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.600]   Just do what it says, and that's what he was doing.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.020]   He'd just go and preach the gospel,
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.620]   and if they bear fruit, it becomes a church,
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.700]   and then that's the place.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.980]   If you look at what he's saying here,
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.420]   that's exactly what he says.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.740]   Go and preach.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.180]   If they receive you, stay there.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.540]   Your sustenance is gonna come from there.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.940]   If they don't, just move away and keep preaching.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.940]   And they're just following that pattern.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.420]   One, go where he tells you to go.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.580]   Say what he tells you to say.
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.620]   Do what he tells you to do.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.660]   Just listen to what he has to say.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.780]   Obey what he has to say.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.720]   The more intelligent and smarter we get,
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:07.740]   sometimes it's our own training,
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.700]   it's our own knowledge, it sometimes gets in the way,
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.340]   because we become confident in ourselves more than God.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:19.900]   Whatever causes you to pray more is good,
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.260]   even if it's painful.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:28.340]   Whatever causes you to be more desperate for God is good.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.380]   God has ordained it.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.700]   Because what the best thing that a church
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.980]   or an individual or a family can have
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.060]   is to be desperate and to come to Christ.
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:42.780]   That's the first thing that I wanted to highlight here.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.140]   Second thing, the reason why he tells them
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.420]   not to go from house to house
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.940]   and to stay at the house that they're in
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.060]   is so that they won't be accused of wrong motives.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.900]   The first thing that you'll see
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.900]   if you wanna nullify the message
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.460]   of the person that's preaching
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.340]   is to nullify the messenger.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.700]   The reason why the Bible says
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.020]   that an elder must be above reproach
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:12.020]   is because whatever he doesn't have a clear conscience in,
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.400]   he won't preach.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.900]   So if he doesn't have integrity with money,
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.860]   he's gonna stay away from that subject.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.060]   If he doesn't have integrity with his purity,
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.660]   the church is not gonna hear of that
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.940]   because it bothers his conscience.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.420]   So to be able to teach, he needs to be above reproach.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.760]   If you have leaders who are kind of like
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.860]   a blind spot that they never deal with,
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.700]   he's like, "I'm weak at this."
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.860]   In fact, we are weak.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:41.700]   And that area that he doesn't have a clear conscience
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.900]   won't ever be touched
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.500]   'cause he doesn't have the authority to say anything.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:50.500]   Or even if he does preach it
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.100]   and we're not above reproach,
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.900]   then somebody else is going to push back.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.540]   Well, you're telling us to have integrity here,
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.500]   but what about you?
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.740]   I've seen the way you use money.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.620]   I've seen the way you live your life.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.580]   And so you're not gonna be able to disciple the church
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.060]   'cause anything you say that they don't like,
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.600]   they're gonna use the areas of your life
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.700]   that you're not standing righteous before God
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.540]   and they're gonna disqualify you.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.460]   See, what Jesus was saying to them
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.920]   is because these false prophets were coming into town
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.300]   preaching for their own benefit
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:24.100]   and repeats that over and over again.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.380]   He's not preaching representing God.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:27.980]   He may be saying the right words,
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.160]   but his ultimate motive was for his own profit.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.580]   And every false prophet,
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.380]   the end game, end motive is his own glory
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.580]   and his own benefit,
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.100]   whether it is financial or whether it is social.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:46.020]   In order to prevent that,
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.740]   so they couldn't accuse him, he says, "Stay there.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.580]   "Eat whatever you eat."
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:50.660]   And it's like, "Well, how do you know?
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.500]   "I don't like this kind of food.
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.820]   "What if they give me this food that I don't like?"
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.420]   He said, "No, just eat whatever they give you
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.840]   "and stay, stop hopping around
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.340]   "looking for a better place to stay."
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.180]   Right?
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.700]   He said, "Go there, preach."
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.020]   And in fact, in Corinthians,
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.540]   because they were trying to disqualify Apostle Paul
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.480]   because they didn't like what Apostle Paul had to say.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.780]   The harshest letter that he writes in the New Testament
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.220]   is to 1 and 2 Corinthians.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.420]   Even though he planted the church,
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:20.540]   he was basically calling out,
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.460]   he said, "Shall I come to you with a whip?"
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.960]   I mean, it's harsh.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.500]   He said, "You're allowing things
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.060]   "that even the pagans wouldn't allow."
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.060]   So he was writing harsh letters.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.620]   And so people started pushing back, saying,
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.980]   "Oh, this guy's a downer.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:41.580]   "Maybe he's not an apostle, so he's defending himself."
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.120]   And they were accusing him and saying like,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.100]   "Oh, this guy's like anybody else coming into town
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.460]   "and he wants profit.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.580]   "He's like any other false prophet
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.060]   "'cause he's saying things that we don't wanna hear."
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.460]   And this is what Paul says.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.320]   "In defense, for it is written in the law of Moses,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.800]   "you shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.540]   "God is not concerned about oxen, is he?
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:01.960]   "Or is he speaking altogether for our sake?
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.500]   "Yes, for our sake, it was written
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:07.500]   "because the plowman ought to plow in hope
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.240]   "and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.900]   "If we sow spiritual things in you,
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.660]   "is it too much if we reap material things from you?"
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.780]   In other words, I have every right.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.980]   According to the law of God, if I demanded money,
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.220]   I would have every right to do this.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.900]   If others share the right over you, do we not more?
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.700]   And he's saying this because they were accusing him.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.540]   This guy's coming in, he's saying these horrible things
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.260]   because he doesn't really represent God.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.100]   All he wants is profit, just like anybody else.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.280]   He says, "First of all, I have every right to ask
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.380]   "if I did ask," but he says, "Nevertheless,
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.980]   "we did not use this right, but we endure all things
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.940]   "so that we will cause no hindrance
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.820]   "to the gospel of Christ."
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.140]   And he says something very similar.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.020]   In 1 Thessalonians 2, five, six, and nine.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.700]   After he leaves, the persecutors,
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.000]   in order to disqualify his message, say,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.020]   "These are false prophets.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.800]   "They came into town just like anybody else.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.620]   "They're gonna come in for their own benefit."
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.820]   And so Paul writes to them, said,
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:10.880]   "You remember how night and day we worked so hard
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.780]   "not to be a burden to you.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.020]   "We didn't ask for your money.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.020]   "You remember that."
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.860]   And so he was defending himself.
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:21.540]   It was clear by our action that we didn't come for money.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.940]   We didn't come to benefit that way.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.780]   We were preaching the gospel to you,
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.580]   and we cared for you like a nursing mother.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:33.060]   And you know, you know that what they're accusing me of
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.860]   is wrong because you remember how we were
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.820]   when we were with you.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:41.300]   So Jesus was telling them, "Don't give them any reason
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.780]   "to accuse you and disqualify what you're saying
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.540]   "because they don't like what you have to say.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.580]   "Stay where you are, eat what they give you,
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.580]   "sleep where He sends you,
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.820]   "and make sure that you make the gospel the center."
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:00.340]   Years ago, we were coming in out of China,
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.740]   and SARS broke out in China,
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.420]   and so like a month before we were supposed to leave,
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.940]   we got notice from China saying we can't come in.
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.620]   So last minute, we had maybe about 13 people
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.520]   are ready to go to China.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.980]   We had to change direction,
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.220]   and we ended up going to Romania.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:19.100]   So we went to the remote villages in Bucharest in Romania,
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:22.980]   and so we were going around city from village to village,
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.660]   and we found out that in every village
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.500]   there was a Greek Orthodox Church,
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.860]   sorry, Eastern Orthodox Church.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:30.780]   It was clearly visible.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.180]   The biggest and the nicest building
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.800]   was always the Eastern Orthodox Church.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.220]   And so we were there going straight evangelism,
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.100]   two by two, and we knocked on this door,
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.340]   and this young lady came out,
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.500]   and you could tell she was in tears.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.100]   And she said, "I don't have time to talk to you."
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.180]   And he said, "Oh, what's going on?"
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:46.580]   'Cause we're trying to share the gospel
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.300]   through the interpreter.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.100]   And she said, "My father's on his deathbed,
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.060]   "so I don't have time."
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.500]   And so we said, "Can we come and pray for him?"
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:57.500]   And as soon as we said that,
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.120]   what she said to us was, "How much is this gonna cost me?"
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:05.220]   I said, "What do you mean, how much is it gonna cost?"
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.700]   He said, "'Cause if I ask the Eastern Orthodox priest
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.580]   "to come, there's a certain amount that they have to pay."
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.220]   So anytime they come to visit,
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.680]   you have to have money to give them.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.620]   And I remember just being so angered when I heard that,
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:24.100]   that they're peddling the word of God for money.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.320]   So we shared with them and said,
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.580]   "No, we're not gonna charge any money,
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.100]   "but can we come and pray for your father?"
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.300]   And so she reluctantly, through the interpreter,
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.660]   let us in, and we spent maybe about 30 minutes
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.160]   praying for the dad.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.060]   And clearly, he was at this last breath.
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.660]   After we prayed, we turned around,
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.500]   and you could tell the young daughter was in tears.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:48.020]   And we turned around, trying to pray with her.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.060]   The first thing that came out of her mouth was,
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.280]   "How much is this gonna cost me?"
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.700]   'Cause she just couldn't understand.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.420]   'Cause she's never seen anybody come
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   and visit her without money.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:03.580]   And so I shared with them, again, through the interpreter,
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.480]   "If somebody comes to you and demands money
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.160]   "to share the word of God with you,
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.420]   "they are false prophets.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.660]   "They're not from God."
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.140]   Christ came and gave his only begotten son freely,
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.640]   and offered salvation freely.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.700]   So if any man stands between God and you,
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.420]   and demands money to do the work,
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.460]   they're not from God.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:31.420]   Jesus was telling his disciples, again, to avoid this,
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.760]   so that they don't get confused with the false prophets.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.920]   Make the message central.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.500]   Go where I send you, do what I tell you to do,
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.140]   and speak what I tell you to speak.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.620]   Whether suffering comes, or whether they welcome you.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:49.300]   But sixth and finally, it is the preaching of the gospel
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.640]   that will bring peace or condemnation.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.540]   It says in Luke 10, five through six,
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.340]   "Whatever house you enter, first say,
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.320]   "Peace be to this house.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.960]   "If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him,
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.440]   "but if not, it will return to you."
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.600]   Now what does that mean?
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.860]   Let your peace.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.780]   So it's just like, did he give them some special power?
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.260]   So if I walk around and say, "Peace," right?
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.860]   And everybody here is, "Peace."
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.480]   It's like, no peace to you, right?
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.300]   So you're not gonna be able to digest your food,
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.600]   or you're gonna have trouble today.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.420]   It's like, what authority do I have, right?
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.600]   You know, in our culture, when somebody sneezes,
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.440]   what do you say?
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.100]   What do you say?
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.740]   God bless you, right?
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:40.940]   Do you ever search to find out where that comes from?
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.140]   There's so many things that we do.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.820]   We don't exactly know what we're doing,
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.300]   but it's just been passed down, right,
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.120]   since we're children.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.900]   Somebody sneezes, say, "God bless you."
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.320]   You know where that tradition started?
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.820]   It started during the Dark Ages,
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.740]   because there was a plague going around,
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.900]   and people would cough, and they were living in fear.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.260]   And they thought, again, superstitiously,
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.540]   that if they coughed, that their soul
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.900]   was gonna come out of them,
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.100]   that the spirit was coming out of them,
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.300]   because people would cough, and the next thing you would see
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.660]   is that they would fall to the ground and die.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.820]   So again, superstitiously, they thought
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.180]   that if they cough, and the soul was coming out,
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.900]   that if you say, "God bless you," fast enough,
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.180]   that the soul would get sucked back into you.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.940]   Did you know that that's what you were doing?
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.940]   Now, obviously, you know, we don't say,
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.520]   "God bless you," thinking that in mind,
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.800]   but that's where it originated, right?
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.120]   But think about that.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.620]   What power do you have to simply bless people,
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.140]   like, "May peace be upon you"?
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.620]   So what does this mean?
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.860]   Let the peace rest on this home,
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.760]   and let the peace return to you if we reject the kingdom.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.080]   I think this will be helpful.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.500]   In a traditional Christian wedding,
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.620]   there's a part of the wedding where, you know,
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.420]   I see less and less of this today,
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.220]   and I don't do it when I officiate the weddings,
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.820]   because people don't understand the meaning behind it.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.800]   But there's a part of the wedding
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.260]   before you finalize their covenant oath,
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.020]   where the pastor will say,
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.600]   "If anybody has anything against these two getting married,
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.700]   "let him speak now, or forever hold your," what?
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.360]   "Peace."
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.920]   So the meaning behind a Christian wedding is that,
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.680]   again, there's no special power upon the officiant
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.320]   where he's kinda like, "Okay, now I'm gonna bless you,"
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.360]   right?
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.040]   Like, if you go to a Catholic church and they have water
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.360]   that they pour upon you, "Bless you, bless you,"
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.580]   what power do they have to do that?
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.920]   All you did was get wet.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.800]   There's no power behind that, right?
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.280]   So if an officiant says, "God bless this,"
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.120]   all he is saying is,
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.720]   "We are recognizing God's blessing upon this union."
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.280]   And then when he opens up to the congregation,
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.760]   it's basically saying, "Do you agree?"
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.820]   So a Christian wedding is a community of believers
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.400]   that are gathered together
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.560]   and recognizing God's blessing upon this union.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.060]   And that's why it's done publicly.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.880]   So if you can't do that,
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.880]   he says, "Speak now, or forever hold your peace."
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.440]   In other words, you had an opportunity to speak,
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.840]   but you didn't, so from this day forward,
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.120]   it means that you are blessing this union,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.640]   that you are, in conjunction with everybody else in there,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.960]   that you are blessing this union.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.200]   Now, the reason why I share that,
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.740]   it helps us to understand its meaning.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.400]   That these 70 people did not have special authority
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.360]   to bring peace upon these people.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.600]   What it basically means is bringing the gospel to these homes
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.660]   is bringing God's peace upon these homes if they receive it.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.600]   And God's peace is lifted if they do not receive it.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:51.400]   And that's why the Bible talks about Ephesians 2, 14,
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.240]   "For he himself is our peace,
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.880]   "who made both groups into one
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.920]   "and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall."
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.520]   He is our peace.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.960]   Jesus is called the King of Peace.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.840]   Ephesians 2, 17, "He came and preached peace to you
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.440]   "who were far away and peace to those who were near."
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.640]   Ephesians 6, 15, "The gospel is called the gospel of peace."
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.200]   The Christian greetings in the New Testament is what?
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.240]   Grace and peace to you.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.400]   And the reason why this is so important
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.640]   is because the scripture says
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.000]   that when God created man, for six days he labored,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.840]   and the seventh day, what happened?
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.080]   He entered into the Sabbath.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:29.920]   Sabbath is what?
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.240]   Another word for rest.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.700]   When mankind sinned, that Sabbath was broken.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.020]   And as a result of that, of the Sabbath being broken,
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.400]   God has been pursuing mankind
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.280]   to bring him back into the Sabbath.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.960]   And Sabbath is just another word for peace.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.400]   And that's why the Jews, when they greet each other,
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.240]   even to this day, they would say, "Shalom aleichem."
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.120]   Basically means, "May God's peace be upon you."
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.880]   And the meaning behind shalom
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.920]   is that all that God had intended to be restored
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.220]   back to what God has intended.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.440]   That's what they mean, that's what their greeting means.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.040]   In fact, I thought it was really interesting
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.640]   because there's so many cultures
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.200]   that use the word peace as a greeting.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.920]   Romania, the way they greet each other,
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.180]   they say, "Pace," which is another word for peace.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.340]   In Hawaii, how do they greet each other?
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.840]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.960]   How do the Hawaiians greet each other?
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.000]   Shaka bra, no, that's not it.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.900]   Maybe the surfers.
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:39.160]   They say what?
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.140]   Aloha, exactly.
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.480]   And what does aloha mean?
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.340]   Hello, goodbye, right?
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.980]   Well, that's what we mean when we say it,
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.420]   but the literal meaning of aloha is peace.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.840]   Peace, mercy, and grace, that's what aloha means.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.760]   In fact, the whole Middle East,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.220]   how do they greet each other?
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:03.560]   As-salam meleko, and then when you hear that,
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.240]   they would say, "Meleko as-salam."
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.820]   It means God's peace be upon you,
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.480]   and then in return it said, "May peace of God be upon you."
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.120]   That's how they greet each other.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.840]   And there's many other cultures
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.140]   where the greeting is peace.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.280]   The reason why I believe that this is happening
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.100]   around the earth, because the Bible says,
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.600]   "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.740]   and because that peace of God was broken in mankind.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.360]   And whether mankind recognizes this or not,
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:39.300]   there is no peace until we are restored back to our creator.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:43.880]   Peace with God is what causes us
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.860]   to have peace with one another.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.520]   And so when he says, "When you go preach the kingdom,
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.520]   "and they receive you, may the peace of God rest upon them.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.600]   "But if they reject you, then may your peace return."
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.680]   That's what he means.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.440]   Let me close with this, because I always,
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.680]   I thought this was really interesting.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.340]   In Luke chapter 10, eight through 11,
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.560]   he concludes by saying this.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.180]   He says, "Whatever city you enter, and they receive you,
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:14.940]   "eat what is set before you, heal those in it who are sick,
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.600]   "and say to them, 'The kingdom of God
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.760]   "'has come near to you.'"
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.860]   These are people who are receiving
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.220]   the message of the kingdom, right?
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.060]   "If they receive you, and they take care of you,
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.920]   "they feed you, and they house you,
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.460]   "may God's peace be upon them,
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.160]   "and remind them, 'The kingdom of God has come near you.'
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.900]   "But," in verse 10, "whatever city you enter,
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.220]   "and they do not receive you, go out into the streets,
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.360]   "and say, 'Even the dust of your city,
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.660]   "'which clings to our feet,
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.980]   "'we wipe off in protest against you.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.040]   "'Yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.520]   "'has come near you.'"
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:53.520]   You notice here, the message of peace,
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.660]   message of condemnation,
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.460]   he said, "Reminds them of the same thing."
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.140]   Whether God's peace is gonna come upon you,
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.820]   whether judgment's gonna come upon you,
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:06.620]   he says, "The kingdom of God has come upon you."
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.820]   It is the preaching of the kingdom
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.940]   that will either bring peace or condemnation.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:15.620]   Because if you're a child of the king,
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.980]   and you receive the king,
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.140]   and you become part of his kingdom,
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.020]   then peace has come upon you.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.100]   Colossians 1, 13 to 14,
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.300]   "For he rescued us from a domain of darkness,
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.060]   "and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son,
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:32.040]   "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.300]   So the preaching of the king and his kingdom brings peace,
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.620]   because now we are under his rule, his care,
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.900]   and so that king and that kingdom, now you are safe.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.020]   No enemy's gonna attack you.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.460]   That's why he says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.660]   "I shall not be in want."
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.780]   And then at the end, he says,
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.620]   he prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies,
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.340]   and I shall fear no evil,
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.940]   because my shepherd, my king, is with me.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.200]   But if you reject this kingdom, and you reject this rule,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.940]   then that same powerful, holy, holy, holy God
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.040]   stands against you.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.340]   And that kingdom coming, instead of bringing peace,
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:21.100]   it's going to bring turmoil, anxiety, and fear.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:27.360]   So he commissioned his disciples to go preach the kingdom.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.060]   If they receive you, may your peace rest upon them.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:36.060]   If they reject you, take the peace back,
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.800]   and move on to the next.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.860]   That's the calling that every Christian has been given.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.260]   That's what church planting is at the end of the day,
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.360]   and that's what we have been called to do.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.660]   You don't have to be so smart.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.000]   We don't have to be so experienced.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.420]   We don't need to go to seminary.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.060]   I'm not saying don't go to seminary,
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.060]   but we don't have to go.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.300]   Don't convince yourself.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.020]   Don't add more to what God has given us.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.500]   There's a reason why he deliberately chose foolish people
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   to be the first commissioned to go and preach the gospel,
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.900]   because he had less to re-educate.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.860]   He had less to re-educate.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.220]   He was starting from scratch to humble people.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.640]   So the thing that we need to do,
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.620]   in order for us to be effective, first and foremost,
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.660]   is to humble ourselves before his mighty throne.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:34.980]   That our effectiveness comes from abiding in him,
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:35.820]   in him alone.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:41.000]   So you are equipped, you are ready,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.500]   and you are commissioned for the kingdom of God.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.340]   Let's pray.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:51.560]   Father, we thank you for your mercies.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.260]   We thank you for your living word.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.800]   We thank you for constant humbling, Lord God, of our pride,
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.920]   knowing that you are enough.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.940]   Search us and know us and see if there's
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.760]   any hurtful ways in us.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.060]   Help us, Lord God, to know who you are,
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.540]   that you are the Lord of the harvest,
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.300]   and as we see darkness all around us,
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.940]   as you warned us that because of increase of wickedness,
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.380]   that most people's love will grow cold,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.420]   help us, Lord God, to labor, to fight,
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.660]   to struggle, Lord God,
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:28.060]   to make sure that our heart doesn't slip
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.300]   for the things of this world,
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.100]   that we do not justify our own sins,
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.260]   that we do not rely upon our own intellect
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.000]   or resources or talent,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.780]   but that we would be people who are humble
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.740]   before your throne, beseeching you
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.100]   to send more workers into your harvest.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.660]   Give us compassion as you had compassion on us.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:51.100]   Help us, Lord God, to intercede on the behalf
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.140]   of this dark world,
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:56.700]   that you would bring the revival that only you can bring.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.500]   May your name and your name alone be magnified
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.340]   in this church.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.140]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
