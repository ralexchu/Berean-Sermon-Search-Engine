[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Ephesians 3, verses 14-21.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.320]   So we're going to be taking, again, taking a couple weeks in this text as we prepare
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.000]   for 2022, and we want to make sure that we understand what our priorities are and what
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.960]   are some things that we're going to be focusing on in the new year in 2022.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.880]   I want to take two weeks to dive into this text and hopefully we'll get a better footing
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120]   of where we're headed in the next year.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.160]   I'm going to be looking at verse 14 all the way to verse 21.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.240]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.480]   For this reason I bound my knees before the Father from whom every family in heaven and
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.720]   on earth thrives its name, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.280]   be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.320]   in your hearts through faith, and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.320]   and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.840]   the fullness of God.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.440]   Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   to the power that works within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.560]   to all generations forever and ever.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560]   Amen.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.220]   - Gracious Father, we ask for your guidance.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.360]   We ask for your Holy Spirit to lead us.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.880]   Lord, we know that we can exposit and we can teach, and yet without your Holy Spirit, Lord,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   we can understand nothing.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   And so we are dependent on you, asking Father for your grace.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.480]   Open our eyes, our ears, soften our hearts, Lord God, that we may receive your word.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.520]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.840]   Some of you guys probably already know that the names of each month of the year is actually
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.320]   based upon some Roman idol or God that they worshiped, because our calendar came from
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.600]   that period.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.920]   And so the Roman idol that got the name for January is Janus.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.640]   And the reason why they named January Janus is because Janus, the God that the Romans
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.520]   worshiped, was the guardian of the arches or doors.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   And what it represented was that you would pass from the previous year to the new year,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.720]   and so this God Janus guarded that door to make sure that the right things are passing
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.480]   through, and that's why they named January January.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.880]   Appropriately, obviously, because we're making that transition, and then every year around
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.680]   this time, you know, we make New Year's resolutions as we think about the past, what happened
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.240]   in 2021, and where should we be headed in 2022.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.600]   And so again, we're in this text because we want to make sure that we're grounded and
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200]   we're on the same page going forward.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.560]   You probably heard this quote from Socrates many times, "An unexamined life is not worth
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   living."
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.360]   And so I know many of you heard this before.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.840]   This is a quote that is quoted quite a bit, but I'm not sure how many of you know the
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.000]   context in which he said this.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.160]   Socrates actually was executed because of his influence on the youth of his generation.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.840]   So he was beginning to question some of the state's mandates of what gods that they're
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.000]   supposed to worship, what gods they're not supposed to worship.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.920]   And so Socrates in no way was a Christian, but he was beginning to influence the youth,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.480]   telling them that some of these idols were worthless, and he was introducing idols of
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.680]   his own.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   And so they brought him into court basically saying that if you don't stop teaching these
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.840]   youth and begin to have this mass influence, that you're going to be jailed or even executed.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.440]   So it's in that context that Socrates stood up and said, "A life that is unexamined is
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.440]   not worth living."
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.640]   In other words, I'd rather die than to just give in and just you telling me to think the
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.000]   way I'm supposed to think and do whatever I'm told to do, it's not worth living.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.480]   So that's the context in which Socrates says this term, "An unexamined life is not worth
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.400]   living."
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.480]   As we face 2022, what is it that we have thought in 2021 that needs to change?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.160]   What are some things that we're going through in the new year that we want to examine?
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.800]   Whenever we want to head somewhere, we need to make sure that we have three things that
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   we need to know.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.080]   First, let's say if you're going to Fashion Island and you're looking for Nordstrom, as
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   an example.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.480]   The first thing you do when you get out of your parking lot and you get to, before you
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.360]   start walking, you need to find out where Nordstrom is.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.080]   So typically you'll look at a map, find out where it is, and then once you find out where
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.240]   it is, there's a second thing that you need to know.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.120]   What's the second thing you need to know?
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.680]   You need to know where you are.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.560]   Knowing where Nordstrom is is useless unless you know exactly where you are.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.360]   And so once you find out where you need to go and then you figure out where you are,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.920]   the next step is what's the fastest way to get there?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.740]   What's the most efficient way to get there?
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.120]   So whenever we're lost or when we have specific direction, we need to first figure out where
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.960]   am I going?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.680]   And so Apostle Paul actually says this very thing in Philippians chapter 3, 12 through
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.560]   13, as he is in jail with possibility of execution, he says in summary of his life, he says, "Not
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.480]   that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:50.120]   lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.300]   Apostle Paul says his main goal in his life is to possess for himself what Christ has
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.860]   given him.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.740]   Now we all know that we've been purchased by the blood of Christ so we belong to him.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.060]   But Apostle Paul says, "As much as I belong to him," he says, "Christ needs to belong
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.100]   to me."
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.880]   And so his life goal was to know Christ.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.760]   Know Christ and then obviously his ministry was to make him known.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.280]   So his goal is pretty clear and this is not uniquely to Apostle Paul but for every Christian,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.320]   that our purpose in life is to have Christ and then to have more of Christ, to know him,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.920]   to love him, to proclaim him, to honor him, to glorify him.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.400]   This is nothing new to any Christian.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.000]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know that the Bible makes it
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.980]   clear this is our goal.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.600]   But the second thing that we need to know is then where are you in that?
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   Apostle Paul says, "Not that I have already obtained it."
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.480]   He says, "I'm not there yet."
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.360]   If Apostle Paul's not there, for sure you and I are not there.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   Typically we can think of our justification, it's like we're saved so from now on we just
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.480]   kind of coast along in life and we'll see where this goes.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.840]   He says, "No, Apostle Paul, the man who teaches us about justification says, 'I have not obtained
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   this yet.'"
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.880]   In other words, he doesn't have the fullness of Christ.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.240]   And so he says, "I'm not there yet," so therefore he says, "I pressed on, I reached, forgetting
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.080]   what is behind."
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:31.800]   And so for every Christian as we face the new year and look back at 2021 and the previous
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.840]   years, what is it that I need to do in order for me to be able to say at the end of my
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.960]   life that I lived a good life?
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   If you have a bucket list of places to go, if you check off all of that, at the end of
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.880]   your life you're going to say, "Well, this was a good life because I saw everything I
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.680]   wanted to see.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.400]   I ate everything I wanted to eat.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.120]   I made as much money as I could."
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.520]   Is that what you would say at the end of your life and say, "This was a good life"?
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.280]   I don't think any Christian would say that, right?
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.240]   Because what we value, at least we profess to value, is Christ.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:16.200]   And so we live based upon what we would be able to say was a good life, to honor Christ,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.920]   to proclaim Christ, to have more of Christ.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.160]   And so what is it that we need to do tangibly when we make applications?
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.320]   Whenever you make an application that's kind of vague, every year you're going to make
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.080]   the same application, "I need to be a better Christian."
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.960]   And so what does that mean, to be a better Christian?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.520]   So at the end of the year you're going to look at your life and you're going to have
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.800]   some things that you feel guilty about, and maybe I shouldn't have done this, I should
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   be a better Christian.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   The next year, when the new year comes around, you say, "Well, what do you need to do?"
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.480]   "Yeah, I should be a better Christian."
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.720]   Whenever you make your applications vague, you're going to end up repeating the cycle
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.880]   over and over again, right?
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.840]   So if we're going to make application, we need to be specific.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.520]   What is it that you think needs to be put away?
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.960]   What is it that you need to actively pursue and prioritize?
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.000]   So if you say, "I'm going to value my time with Christ and I'm going to really prioritize
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.080]   that," when is that going to happen?
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   I say, "In the morning."
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.720]   Well, what time in the morning?
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.960]   What time do you normally wake up?
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.560]   And what time should you wake up?
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560]   What is it that you need to do?
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.380]   And so you need to put that on the calendar.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.200]   So if you say, "I need to be in better health," what does that mean?
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.440]   You're going to go to the gym?
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   How many times?
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   What are you going to do?
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.040]   What are the exercises programmed?
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.600]   So you take all of that and you apply that, and then after you finish, you can look back
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.540]   and say, "I did it or I didn't do it."
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.120]   But if we're not careful, we make these general sweeping things that I need to be in better
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.280]   health, I need to do this better, but then there's no specific applications that we make
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.220]   in order for us to take this path.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:58.200]   It's just like going to Fashion Ion, I need to get to Nordstrom, I'm way over here, hopefully
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.080]   I can get there.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.020]   And then you just don't look at the path and you don't start walking, right?
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.920]   And so that's the reason that we want to make sure that as we're headed to 2022, what is
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:15.440]   it that we lack individually, but specifically today, what is it we lack as a church that
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.120]   we want to make sure that we need to be strengthened in?
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.880]   Last year, our theme was "Watch and Pray."
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   I put today's title of my sermon, "Hope and Pray," right?
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.500]   So the theme is not much different.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.760]   And the reason why it's not much different is because at the end of the year, as the
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.560]   elders get together and we evaluate where we need to go, again, we feel like this is
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.420]   our weakness in the church.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.080]   And so this is not...through the years, we probably put this as a theme more than any
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   other theme, right?
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.100]   There's a few years where we say we need to build community, we need to have better teaching
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:56.560]   in this and that area or evangelism, but probably more than any other theme that we've evaluated
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.600]   and said we need to really be strengthened, and it's probably this topic of discipline
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.440]   of prayer.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.200]   And I don't think it's any different this year.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.720]   I feel like we made some progress, but not to the point where we feel like where we ought
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   to be.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:22.440]   We need to be a church that is not just known for Bible teaching, but also for prayer.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:28.120]   Prayer tends to be weak in Bible teaching churches, and I don't think we're any different
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.340]   if we're being honest with ourselves.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:38.520]   We have a tendency, because we know our theology, we know our Bible, that somehow that gives
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:44.680]   us an edge to everybody else.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:52.720]   If we are theological and if we are Bible-centered, without prayer, without you knowing it, you
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   will easily become proud.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.240]   Even the ones that may be sitting here thinking like, "I don't know about that."
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240]   Some of you are thinking that.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:09.460]   Obviously, I'm exaggerating, but almost always, if you commit yourself to the Word of God
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.160]   without prayer, pride creeps in, whether you know it or not.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.760]   Because you think you know when you really don't.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.500]   You feel like you're in the presence of God when you're not.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.880]   You think you know God when you do not know Him.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.480]   It's just like it's no different than reading a book about somebody and saying, "I know
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   Him."
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   It's like, "No, you don't know Him.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   You know about Him.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.320]   You don't know Him."
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:39.920]   And that's why a tendency is a strong Bible-teaching church tends to be weak in prayer because
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.160]   we feel confident that we are right with God in this.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   And yeah, of course, yeah.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:51.320]   Of course, prayer is important, but we don't realize just how important it is.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.780]   If I teach wrong doctrine, you will be up in arms, and I hope you will be.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.900]   If you're not, I'd be very disappointed.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:06.020]   If I taught something wrong and nobody said, "Amen," and then you went home, I'm not doing
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.860]   my job.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.640]   But for some reason, Bible-teaching churches, when prayer is lacking, there is no up in
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.160]   arms.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.740]   There's no grieving.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.580]   And again, that's because this is our blind spot, and we need to work on that.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.860]   We need to emphasize that.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.300]   And even if it takes the rest of my life, we need to work on that.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.340]   And I say this not because I've mastered prayer, but because I desire to, and I want our church
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.440]   to be the same.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.260]   We need to be focused on prayer.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:47.660]   Ephesians 6, 18-19, we are told to put on the full armor of God.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.140]   The helmet of salvation, but breastplate of righteousness.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.740]   And after he goes through all of that, saying that our battle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.940]   it's a spiritual battle, and after he tells us all of this, he concludes this statement
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:06.060]   by saying in verse 18-19, "With all prayers and petitions, pray at all times in the Spirit,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.900]   and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance, with petitions for all the
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:16.020]   saints, and pray for me on behalf so that utterance may be given, my mouth will be opened
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.420]   to proclaim the gospel."
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.540]   And so in other words, what he says, after you've done all of that, he says, pray, pray,
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.700]   pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.340]   That's how he ends that whole section.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.860]   So we shouldn't miss that, the whole point that he's trying to get at.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:39.460]   After you've done all of that, if you do not pray, you end up relying upon your own resources,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.180]   your own knowledge, your own experience, your own intellect.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.620]   After you've done everything that God calls you to do, humble yourselves and recognize
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:56.820]   that you need Christ in your theology, that you and I need Christ in our ability, in our
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:04.100]   talent, because easily we can take every gift that God has given us and turn it into a curse,
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.500]   because it brings pride inside of us.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.340]   We need to pray.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.860]   Think about Jesus' ministry, his disciples who walked with him, and all the things that
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.340]   the disciples could have asked Jesus to teach them.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.380]   Jesus, that his disciples said, "Teach us how to do what?
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.380]   Walk on water?"
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.740]   I think I would have asked that, right?
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.740]   That's a cool trick.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.260]   Evangelism would be so easy if I just walked on water.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.260]   Just gather people and walk on water.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.860]   And if I was levitating on water and preached the gospel, in my mind, I think they'd come
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.140]   to Christ, right?
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.860]   You get a bunch of hungry people together and feed them miraculously.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.060]   I say, "Man, that might help a little bit."
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.580]   He raised people from the dead.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:58.380]   He calmed storms that even professional fishermen were scared to death because of the storm.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.420]   And he just comes out and says, "Stop."
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   And you want to think with all the things that Jesus did, that the disciples would teach
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.900]   us how to do that.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.660]   Teach us how to multiply fish and loaves.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.100]   Teach us how to walk on water.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.220]   Teach us how to heal the sick, the lame.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.140]   Open eyes to the people who are blind.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:27.140]   Yet they observed of all the things that Jesus did, that what they wanted to be able to do,
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.500]   teach us, Lord, how to pray.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.620]   I think about it from our perspective.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.740]   Do you not know how to pray?
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.260]   Of all the things that Jesus did, prayer is the most mundane.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.740]   Prayer is something that they've been doing for thousands of years.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.440]   Prayer is something that any one of us can decide to do.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.740]   Is it because they didn't know how to close their eyes?
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.580]   Is it because they didn't know the words or they weren't articulate enough?
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.260]   What was it about Jesus' prayer in the midst of all the miracles and the power that He
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.260]   demonstrated?
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.940]   He says, teach us how to pray.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.860]   There was something about His prayer life that they recognized that this is something
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.660]   that we need to have.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.260]   Above everything else that Jesus was doing.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.940]   Teach us how to pray.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.580]   Matthew chapter 7, 7, Jesus says, ask and it will be given to you.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.580]   Seek and you will find.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.660]   Knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.860]   I mean, He's a sovereign God.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.460]   Why do we need to ask?
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.460]   Why do we need to knock?
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.340]   If He's so eager to give it to us, why does He wait for us to knock?
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:41.820]   And to ask so He can answer us.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.180]   Think about what the point of salvation ultimately is.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.980]   The point of salvation isn't simply to save us from the penalty of sin, but the power
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.980]   of sin.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.100]   For what purpose?
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.460]   So that we can come to Him.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.060]   That's the point of the gospel.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.700]   The point of the gospel is not simply not going to hell.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:10.440]   That is a byproduct of being reunited with our Heavenly Father, the author of life.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.220]   So the whole point of salvation, the whole point of justification is to call sinners
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.040]   to Himself.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.900]   So when He says, your sins have been forgiven, the very next thing is come.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.220]   Because you couldn't come before.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.260]   Sinners could not come to Him.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.220]   In the old covenant, God didn't tell them to come.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.180]   He said to stay away or you will die.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.620]   And if you do want to come, here are all these rituals that you need to go.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.820]   Here are the animals that need to be soldered.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.340]   Here's the blood that needs to be sprinkled all over.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.620]   And He didn't tell them to come.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.940]   Sinners were not welcomed into His presence or you will die.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.860]   So now that Christ has come and washed us with His blood and He took away the barrier,
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.220]   the point of salvation is to come.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.540]   And that's why He says ask, seek, and to knock.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.140]   Because He wants us to take advantage of what it is that He has done for us.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:13.660]   And it says in James chapter 4, 2, you do not have because you do not ask.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.980]   Think about how frustrated we are sometimes with life, the people that we complain about,
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.980]   the circumstance that we're in.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.180]   Have we been bringing this to the Lord?
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.700]   Really bringing this to the Lord?
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.780]   Why is this this way?
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.780]   Why is that?
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.140]   Why did God allow this?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.940]   Did you bring this to Him?
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.220]   Or does this apply to you?
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.500]   You do not have because you did not ask.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:47.860]   I don't know how many times I come to the Lord in prayer frustrated and even angry about
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.900]   certain things at church or maybe even certain people.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:58.140]   And I would be on my knees being rebuked in prayer.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.940]   And in prayer realizing how gracious God is and how loving He is.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.380]   And it was me who was frustrated.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:12.140]   It was me who was bitter that I wasn't practicing the love that He gave to me.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.580]   He was actually much more patient than I was.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.380]   And then there's also times when I'm at perfect peace.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.920]   Everything seems just fine.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.860]   And in prayer realizing that God is not at peace.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.700]   That there is no peace.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.020]   That He wants me to speak on this subject.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.460]   He wants me to say and draw the line and be righteous.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.020]   But I don't know how many times I've thought in my mind that because I have a verse to
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:43.700]   stand on that I have righteousness.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:49.620]   But my heart is corrected when I come in the presence of God in prayer.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:54.700]   I can know all things in my head but there's a huge difference between being illuminated
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.700]   and having revelation.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.620]   Revelation is just having information.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.420]   You have information about God.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.140]   You can study the gospel.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.380]   You can exposit the text.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.500]   And so you have revelation.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.980]   Illumination is when God takes the revelation and He changes your heart.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.960]   He opens your eyes.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.860]   So a sinner is not saved simply because he hears the gospel.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.660]   If that's the case the whole world will be saved.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.780]   All we need to do is proclaim the gospel.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.740]   It's the revelation where the Holy Spirit comes and He opens our eyes and He illuminates
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:32.340]   a sinner to bring him to repentance.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:37.980]   And so the Bible tells us that you and I cannot bear fruit unless we abide in Him.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.260]   So what does abiding mean?
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:46.100]   Abide isn't simply finding more revelation.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.380]   Abiding in Him means to be broken in our sins.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.740]   To be utterly dependent upon Him.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.860]   To be humble before His presence and to be dependent on Him.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.740]   So if you are a man or a woman who is very proficient in the Word of God and weak in
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:06.460]   prayer you're just as weak as somebody who is not proficient with the Word of God and
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.420]   who does not pray.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.900]   You are not anymore righteous.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:17.380]   You do not know Christ anymore than the next person who doesn't know anything but doesn't
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.340]   know God in prayer.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.540]   That's how important prayer is.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.820]   Again, I say all of this because you and I are in a Bible teaching church which I am
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.340]   the primary teacher and this is something that I recognize that we need to continue
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.660]   to strive.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.940]   That prayer is not, as long as we have the right doctrine, like prayer is something that
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.940]   we need to work on.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.940]   No.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.580]   Prayer is just as important.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:52.660]   That if you cannot tolerate wrong teaching you should not tolerate prayerlessness either.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.940]   It is that important.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.340]   And so as a church as we face 2022 this is something that we want to continue to emphasize
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.340]   in our church.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:08.500]   We don't want to be known just as a church that preaches right doctrine.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.700]   We also need to be known as a church that is humble before God in prayer.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:22.780]   The text that we're looking at in verse 14-21 Paul is summarizing what he's been saying
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:27.420]   in three chapters about who God is and then he kind of leads us into prayer.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.660]   This is what he's praying for.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.340]   And so there's five things that I want to point out in this text and so today we're
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.220]   going to cover two and then next week we're going to cover the other three.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:43.020]   So the first thing that we want to look at, why do we need to pray?
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.140]   Why do we need to pray?
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.700]   And he just simply says in verse 14, "for this reason."
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:54.700]   Well, for this reason means that he's been making an argument prior to this text.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.380]   So the immediate context of this is for this reason he's talking about his gospel ministry.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.140]   And I believe that Apostle Paul is not just talking about this immediate context.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.140]   He's talking about what he's been saying all throughout the book of Ephesians.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:13.080]   And so he's summarizing the whole three chapters and he says, "everything that I've been telling
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.780]   you about your salvation and what God has done, the love that he poured upon you, for
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:24.020]   this reason we need to bow our knees before our heavenly father for this reason."
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.580]   So a quick summary of the first three chapters.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:36.580]   Ephesians chapter 1, 3-14, and I'm just going to give you a cliff note version of this text.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.420]   He blessed us.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.060]   He chose us.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.780]   He predestined us.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.580]   He adopted us according to his will, by his grace.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.660]   He redeemed us by his blood, by his grace.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:56.140]   He made known the mystery of his will, according to his kind intention, he purposed, he gave
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.360]   us inheritance to the praise of his glory.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.860]   This text, I mean, it's so rich in theology.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.060]   If you have any text that you say, you know what, I want to really memorize this and put
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.940]   it to heart, it would be this text because it is just rich in theology.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.940]   From predestination to justification to election, adoption, inheritance, all of it is contained
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.100]   in this short text.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.780]   So whenever we go through this text or whenever we study the book of Ephesians, we can get
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:29.300]   wrapped up in what is predestination, what is election, what is adoption, what is inheritance.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:36.100]   Every single one of these topics are rich in theology that we really should master.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.700]   But if we're not careful, we can miss the whole point of this text.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:48.980]   Because this text, as rich it is in theology, what holds it together?
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:56.220]   He says the word he and him over 23 times.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.380]   So when we talk about predestination, election, inheritance, adoption, and all this stuff,
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:06.140]   he always emphasizes he did it, he purposed it, he provided it, he did it according to
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:11.940]   his riches for his glory, his grace, 23 times.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.180]   So the main point of the text isn't simply what we got from that.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.060]   The main point of this text is him.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   He.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   Him.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.060]   He did it.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.060]   He did it.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:30.940]   When a child is adopted into a home, the blessing for that child is not a better house, or a
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:38.700]   nicer car, or better food, or nicer room.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.340]   All these things are byproduct.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.780]   But the main gift is what?
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.700]   You got a new father, a new mother.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:54.540]   And so everything that that child gets is a byproduct of being adopted and loved by
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.540]   the mother and the father.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:03.940]   We can easily mistaken and celebrate predestination and election, and about eternity in heaven,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.620]   and not going to hell, and being freed from judgment.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.780]   We can do all of that and completely miss the point.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:16.180]   Because the whole point of the condemnation of man is that we were separated, fallen what?
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.180]   Short of what?
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:22.420]   Fallen short of joy, fallen short of the garden of Eden, fallen short of heaven.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.700]   All of these things are true.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.460]   But how is it described?
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.560]   We have fallen short of the glory.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.220]   We have fallen short of God's glory.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.260]   We've been separated from the author of life.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:39.000]   So the whole point of salvation is to bring us back.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.180]   To bring us back for this reason.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:50.460]   See, if we're not careful, we can spend all our days celebrating how awesome the work
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.980]   of Christ is by taking away the barrier.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:05.860]   And we become, the more we study the Bible, we become the experts in describing how awesome
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.940]   it was for the door to be gone.
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.940]   The barrier's gone.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.940]   How did He do that?
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.900]   Well, He suffered for us.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.140]   He took on sin for Himself.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.140]   He adopted us.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.140]   He elected us.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.900]   He came incarnate, became incarnate 100% man, 100% God.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:28.620]   And so we become so proficient in theology, and we become experts in describing what happened,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.980]   yet never entering the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.880]   Because the whole point of salvation is not to simply say, the wall, the barrier has been
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.300]   taken away.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.500]   Yes!
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:47.140]   The whole point of salvation is because the barrier is taken away, to come.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.140]   To come.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.980]   It's like receiving a gift and never using it.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.540]   The greatest gift that you and I have, you have, from the old covenant to the new covenant,
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.300]   is that the curtain to the Holy of Holies was ripped.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:09.780]   So the curtain ripping basically meant there was a welcome mat.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:15.580]   Instead of saying, "Return," He said, "Now you can come."
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.100]   That's the invitation of the gospel.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.200]   Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.860]   You know why He says, "I will give you rest"?
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:28.820]   Because we're all striving, the whole world is striving after event after event, job after
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.580]   job, looking for some sort of peace.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:37.060]   It's not peace of mind for our children, peace of mind for retirement, peace of mind
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.540]   in our jobs, in our family.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:45.200]   But He says, "No, come to me, all you who are weary, going from place to place, from
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.540]   stage to stage in life, and you shall not find peace there."
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:56.940]   He says, "I will give you peace, and you shall find rest for your souls.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.860]   My yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.940]   So the whole point of our salvation is to come to Him.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:09.020]   So if we study the Word of God, and we're laboring in the church, and we're doing all
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.940]   of these great things, proclaiming, and yet we neglect prayer, neglect to come to Him,
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.460]   then you've neglected not just a small part of your salvation, you've neglected the whole
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.560]   point of your salvation, to come.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.460]   And that's why He says, "Therefore, come."
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:31.940]   Does your bucket list have anything to do with Christ?
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.700]   Ephesians 1, 18-19, Paul basically summarizes his whole heart.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.940]   And this is something that I think you and I need to pay attention to.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:49.100]   The whole reason why the Bible is taught, the whole reason why we do expository preaching,
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.860]   is not so that at the end of it you say, "Oh, I've heard a lot of sermons from a lot of
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:58.580]   great preachers, and so I know more than you."
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.580]   Hearing and studying of the Word of God for you has done more damage than good, if that's
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.580]   what you think the end result is.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.580]   Come to me.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.700]   Paul says, in Ephesians 1, 18-19, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened."
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.540]   Now, why do their eyes need to be enlightened when Paul basically revealed everything to
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.540]   them?
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.500]   He's like, "Oh, it's because they're not smart?
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.140]   Is he praying for better IQ?
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.820]   Is he praying for all of us to be A students so that we can exposit the text and understand
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.820]   it better?"
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.300]   What does he mean for their eyes to be enlightened when he's the one who told them?
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.780]   No, he's not talking about revelation.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.460]   He's talking about enlightenment.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:49.700]   He's praying that God would use the Word that you've heard and break you, break me, to humble
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:55.580]   me, to bring us to himself.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.820]   He's calling us when he says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.140]   so that you will know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.420]   of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.620]   us who believe."
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:19.380]   Our churches are filled with people who have right theology, who know the verse to quote,
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.580]   "Do not know Christ."
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.620]   And that's the greatest place of danger.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.620]   The person who does the greatest damage is the person who has the greatest knowledge
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.900]   and yet does not know Christ.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.180]   This is why we need to pray.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:44.140]   We need to couple our efforts in the Word of God with much prayer, not just prayer sprinkled,
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:48.980]   not just knowing the importance of prayer, but we need to pray.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   We need to humble ourselves and pray.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.220]   As much attention we give to the exposition of the Word of God, we need to give equal
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.080]   attention to prayer.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.260]   We pray ultimately because we have hope, and that's really the summary of everything he's
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.700]   been saying.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.140]   Why do we need to know the love and the power that we have in Christ?
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.140]   Because we have hope.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.300]   That's what he's saying.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   Because we have hope.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:22.180]   Remember David, because of his great sin, he commits adultery and then he ends up killing
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.580]   Bathsheba's husband, and as a result of that, God said that your kingdom is going to be
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.740]   divided and you're going to lose your first child.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.740]   And just as God said, the prophecy is coming true.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:40.660]   After Bathsheba has her child, the child falls ill and is about to die.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.020]   And David gets on his knees and he begins to pray.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.060]   And he cries out to God and he said he fasted.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.920]   He fasted so much that his subjects were actually concerned for him.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   You should eat something.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   He said, I cannot.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.260]   My child is sick and I need to plead to the Lord.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:03.380]   And as God said, prophecy comes true and his child dies.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.580]   And to the surprise of his subjects, he just gets up, he shakes it off, and then he just
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.900]   goes back to work.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.260]   And so his disciples are perplexed.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.780]   I mean, you were so passionate praying and fasting.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.380]   How do you just, you know, he dies and you just move on?
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:28.140]   And David's response was, as long as he lived, I have hope.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.980]   But now that he's gone, I can go to him, but he can't come to me.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.540]   In other words, the hope is gone.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.820]   So there's no point to pray.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.500]   That's what David was saying.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.380]   See that's David.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.660]   He says he prayed as long as there's hope.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.100]   But here's the difference in the new covenant.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.300]   In a new covenant, remember the disciples, they were so courageous.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.860]   Like Jesus, the leaders of Israel were trying to get at Jesus from the very beginning of
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   his ministry.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.380]   But remember, Jesus would just walk through the crowd, right?
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.380]   He just disappears.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:12.020]   I mean, they hated him from the beginning because from the get-go, it didn't take him
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.900]   a couple years for him to call them out.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:20.580]   As soon as the Pharisees and Sadducees came, Jesus said, who told you to come to be baptized,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.620]   bear fruit in accordance to your repentance?
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.860]   Your repentance means nothing if there's no change in your life.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.940]   And so they were angry with him from the get-go.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.820]   And these are powerful men who could literally put him in jail and possibly even stone him
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.300]   to death.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.860]   And so the disciples, as long as they walked with him, they were safe.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860]   They were hungry.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   He was fed.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.640]   In the middle of the storm, he would calm them down.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.220]   But all of a sudden, Jesus comes into Jerusalem and he begins to surrender.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.500]   He's the most powerful person that they've ever met.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.960]   It's the Messiah, son of God.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.680]   And yet he surrenders himself to go to the cross.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.460]   The disciples are watching him from a distance.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.200]   He must have something up his sleeve.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.660]   He's going to pretend like he's going to surrender.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:11.280]   And then right before he's crucified, he's just going to go, bam!
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.660]   And the revolution is going to take place.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.700]   So they're watching him from a distance, watching, watching.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:23.260]   And then when they realized that Jesus was going to be handed over and die, all of a
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.260]   sudden they're disillusioned.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:32.740]   This courageous man, Peter, who was willing to take his sword out and go on this fight,
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:38.780]   even though humanly they were outnumbered, all of a sudden becomes a coward.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:44.620]   And so as Jesus is being crucified, all the disciples scattered in fear and locked doors
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.060]   that maybe that will happen to them.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.140]   As you know, the story doesn't end there.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.300]   Christ comes back and resurrected on the third day.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:02.700]   And after they meet the resurrected Christ, their hope is reignited.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:08.780]   And it is in this hope Jesus calls them to make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.580]   them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.580]   Behold what?
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.140]   I am with you.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:21.100]   The Christ who was crucified, who was resurrected on the third day, he is with you.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:27.440]   And the apostles say that the power of the cross says even when you die, he said, you
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.320]   shall live.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.500]   And that's what he means when he says for this reason we have to pray because we have
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.800]   hope as Christians.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.380]   It doesn't matter how long this pandemic lasts.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.540]   It doesn't matter what kind of government that we have.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.980]   It doesn't matter what kind of economic downturn that it may have.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.960]   There is no Christian who is never without hope.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.540]   We have a hope that this world cannot take away no matter what circumstance that we're
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.580]   in.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:04.740]   No matter what happens in 2022, our hope remains steadfast and steady.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.540]   And that's what he's trying to say.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.740]   Therefore, he says, we need to pray.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.180]   First Peter 1 through 36, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:21.800]   to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope, through the resurrection
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.280]   of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.920]   To obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, will not fade away, reserved in
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.960]   heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith for salvation, ready
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.120]   to be revealed in the last time.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.860]   You notice he doesn't say protected by your hard work, protected by your church, protected
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.840]   by your ingenuity or the right program.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.840]   He says no, protected by what?
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.080]   By the power of God, by faith.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.600]   Despite.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.600]   Despite us, God says you have hope, living hope.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.400]   So for this reason, he says to pray.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.320]   Secondly, how should we pray?
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:10.760]   In this simple statement, he says to kneel down before, kneel down, bow my knees before
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.320]   the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derived his name.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.720]   He says to kneel.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.000]   Philippians 2, 10 through 11, he says so that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.160]   of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and that every tongue will
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:31.040]   confess that Jesus Christ is Lord through the glory of God the Father.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.520]   We come to Christ humbled, surrendered.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:44.080]   The word kneel, the posture basically is to surrender in awe.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:53.120]   Last week, Pastor Nate gave a sermon about fear and the general thing that was kind of
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.440]   proclaimed last week about fear is there's a fear that leads to despair.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.460]   And that fear we know.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:05.120]   So many of us make decisions based upon what we're afraid of.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.960]   That if we do this, what will people think of me?
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.400]   If we do this, what about the consequence?
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.720]   And so we hedge every decision that we make, what is the results that's going to hit?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.280]   So if I do this, am I going to lose my job?
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.680]   Am I not going to be able to advance in my career?
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.080]   And what if I lose my health?
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.000]   And what if my children don't get what they want?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.680]   And so everything that we do, we hedge it based upon the fear.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.960]   Well, if I say this, what are they going to think of me?
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.800]   If I don't do this, what are they going to think of me?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:45.000]   So all of our life is kind of like hedged and bound by certain fears that we have.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.280]   So there's fear that leads to despair.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:55.440]   And then there's fear that leads to worship, which is what the world doesn't understand.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:03.600]   Because the only fear that leads to worship is when we are knelt before our holy God.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:08.760]   Every instance in the Bible when men and women are in the presence of God's glory, the first
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.440]   response is terror.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.960]   The first response is an, "Oh God, we were waiting for you.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.640]   You know, you loved us.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.360]   And so can I come and sit near you?"
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.520]   It's like that's not the response.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.920]   The immediate response is terror.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.880]   Ezekiel chapter 128, Ezekiel is in the presence of God's glory, the incarnate Christ.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   What happens?
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   He falls on his face.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.040]   He's knelt down, terrified.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:37.760]   Matthew chapter 17, verse 6, God speaks of his son, "This is my son in whom I am well
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   pleased."
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:44.560]   And when the disciples see the glory of God, their first response is they fell on their
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.320]   faces and were terrified.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.800]   In Revelation chapter 117, when Apostle John is in the presence of Jesus' glory, it says
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   he fell down.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.120]   And he says he felt like a dead man.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.400]   And in Revelation 5, verse 14, the elders in the presence of the glory of the throne,
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.520]   he says they fell down.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.000]   And then look what it says in Revelation 7, 11 to 12, "And all the angels were standing
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.800]   around the throne, around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:23.440]   faces before the throne and then worshipped, saying, 'Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:29.000]   and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Amen.'"
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.800]   You don't equate ... you and I don't equate fear with joy.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.680]   If something causes fear, we move away from that.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.780]   We don't buy houses where we don't feel safe.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.880]   We don't take vacations where we're fearful.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   Our whole world got shut down because of fear of this thing that we can't even see.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.480]   Fear usually does not equate with joy and peace.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:05.320]   And yet, in every instance, a man or a woman who have gotten in the presence of God, they
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.360]   fall terrified.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:13.160]   And in their terror, they worship.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.500]   They worship.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.960]   And worship is equated with joy.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.960]   Worship is equated with life.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.400]   And Jesus said, "I have come to give life and give this life abundantly."
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.960]   And it wasn't until they recognized they were in the presence of God's glory that they felt
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:35.680]   terrified and then that terror led to worship and joy and life.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.600]   So the whole purpose of our salvation is to bring us to this holy God, covered in the
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:49.080]   blood of Christ, recognizing who we are standing in front of, who we are praying to, and experiencing
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.960]   this life in His presence.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.120]   One of the most convicting sermons I've heard was on this subject of prayer is Martin Lloyd
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   Jones.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:07.240]   Martin Lloyd Jones says, "Prayer is the hardest, one of the hardest things to do as a professing
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:12.120]   Christian, and it is impossible for an unsurrendered person to pray."
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:18.480]   I mean, prayer as a discipline is easy, physically.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.520]   Close your eyes.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.440]   When other people close their eyes, you close your eyes.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.200]   And you have certain things that you want to say in your head, just say it.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.760]   And say, "Well, we pray."
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:34.240]   But he said, "True prayer, you cannot come to God on your own terms.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:41.880]   An unsurrendered man or woman cannot come into the presence of God."
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:47.160]   Jeremiah 29, verse 13, it says, "You will seek me and find me when you search me with
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.280]   all your heart."
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   Part of the reason why prayer is ineffective in our generation is because our churches
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:03.000]   are filled with people who have not surrendered their lives to Christ.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.240]   And just like Martin Lloyd Jones says, you cannot pray unsurrendered.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.720]   Because the Holy Spirit that is residing in us is groaning and interceding on our behalf,
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.680]   contradicting your prayers.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:26.320]   The thing that the Holy Spirit wants for us and from us is leading away from what we desire
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.640]   from our flesh.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:34.160]   So our prayers and the work of the Holy Spirit is fighting each other.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:40.800]   So when we come to the Lord in prayer, instead of communing with God, we're wrestling with
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.420]   the Spirit.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.960]   And that's why our prayers are so frustrated.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:53.200]   Because an unsurrendered man cannot pray until he has decided for himself that this is what
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   he wants.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:59.080]   And it's in Amos 5, 4, and 6, it says, "Seek me that you may live."
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.600]   It doesn't say, "Seek me so that you may have peace."
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.520]   It doesn't say, "Seek me so that you may experience joy."
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   It says, "Seek me that you may live."
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.840]   Verse 6, "Seek the Lord that you may live."
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.880]   No one casually drifts into the presence of God.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.520]   No one wakes up one morning and says, "You know what?
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   I'm just going to pursue life.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:25.000]   And hopefully, if I'm around enough Christians, and if I attend Bible study faithfully, that
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.840]   I'm going to wake up at the end of 2022 and just have this passionate love for Christ."
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:36.640]   Because everything around us is drifting away from Him.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.480]   So if we don't actively anchor ourselves, if we don't actively pursue Christ, if we
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:47.320]   don't actively pray before God, you will find yourself at the end of 2022, further
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.760]   away from God than where you are today.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.880]   He says, "Seek me that you may live."
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.040]   Even before we pray, we need to make up our mind.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.680]   You can't—bowing the knees here is not just talking about physically, right?
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.000]   As long as you don't have bad knees, any one of us can just get on our knees, right?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Obviously, that's not what he's talking about.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.600]   He's talking about surrendering.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.640]   He's talking about worship.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:25.160]   He's talking about recognizing who he is to be surrendered.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.080]   Remember Joshua?
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.160]   At the end of his life, he was so frustrated with the Israelites because they kept on going
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.040]   back and forth to worshiping God, to worshiping idols.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.560]   And the reason why they were worshiping idols is not because they were more attractive.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.920]   I mean, it's just a wood figure that they just carved out.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   It means nothing.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.240]   There's no power in it.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.600]   But the reason why they kept on worshiping these idols is because they were looking at
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:54.120]   what the Canaanites had and thought, "Maybe if I worship it, maybe we'll have wealth.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.240]   Maybe we'll have more children.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.960]   Maybe we'll have this and that."
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.400]   And so they were willing to compromise because they weren't surrendered to God.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.640]   And it's at the end of his life, Joshua says, "If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.840]   the Lord, choose for yourself today whom you will serve.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.960]   Whether the gods which your father served which were beyond the river or the gods of
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:25.440]   the Amorites," I almost say Americans, "in whose land you are living, but as for me and
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.880]   my house, we will serve the Lord."
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:36.100]   To bow our knees before the Father, we need to make up our mind.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.000]   Have you said this to your family, to yourself?
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.040]   I'm not sure where the other people are going, but for me and my household, we will serve
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.760]   the Lord.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.000]   He is my Lord.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:57.680]   Not my safety, not my comfort, not my retirement, not my wife, not my children.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.120]   He is my Lord.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:06.680]   As we go forward in 2022, as we focus our attention on prayer, because we need to focus
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:14.560]   on prayer, the question we need to ask is, "Are you surrendered?
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.040]   Are you surrendered to Christ?"
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:24.760]   When two people get married, they're entering into a covenant, and it is assumed, and you
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:30.520]   don't have to be a Christian, but it is assumed when they enter a covenant, Christian or non-Christian,
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:38.160]   that they're going to put aside any other relationship outside of this relationship,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.600]   anything romantic.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.280]   No one comes into the altar and say, "You know what?
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   I'll try."
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   Then you shouldn't get married.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.880]   Why do you need to get married?
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.840]   You don't come into the altar and say, "You know what?
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.960]   I feel strong today, but I have no idea tomorrow."
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.480]   No, then don't get married.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.320]   Because a covenant relationship, basically, you're publicly professing that this wife,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:08.360]   this husband, is going to be my sole love for the rest of my life.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:14.680]   So how much more, when we have this covenant relationship with this holy God, that we must
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:21.560]   be committed that we will serve no other gods but Him?
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:28.160]   So a commitment to prayer is a commitment to surrender, to recognize that He's my life,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:35.320]   He's my hope, that all the pain and sorrow that you may be experiencing now, have experienced
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:45.440]   in the past, and may be coming in the future, that my hope is in Christ, in Christ alone,
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.160]   that we would make this commitment together, commit in 2022.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.080]   So I want to ask the praise team to come up.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:59.560]   And as the praise team comes up, I want to sing this song as our closing song.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.280]   And you know this song well, "I Have Decided to Follow Jesus," and I've shared this before,
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.600]   but I want to share again before we sing this.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:10.760]   And as we sing this, make this a dedication for our new year.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.400]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.680]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.800]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.840]   No turning back, no turning back.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.040]   This is a very simple song that you probably, if you grew up in the church, you probably
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.640]   learned it in Sunday school.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:30.600]   But the background story behind this is it was composed by a missionary in 1889.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.540]   So it's been around a while, but the reason why it got so popular is that when Christianity
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:41.120]   began to sweep through India in the remotest parts of the village, this one particular
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.360]   family came to Christ and they were so excited about their faith, they began to share it
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.100]   with their friends.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:53.000]   And so the village leader, who was very hostile toward Christianity, came out and basically
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.560]   got the crowd to be riled up and took all of his family and in the middle of the village,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:05.000]   threatened them that if you do not denounce your faith, that your children and your wife
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.600]   is going to give their life.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.080]   Well, this man sat there and he said, "I cannot deny my faith."
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:16.240]   And he saw his children one by one martyred for their faith.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.480]   And then his wife martyred for her faith.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.640]   And finally he turned to him and saying, "If you do not denounce your faith, you also will
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   lose your life."
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:31.560]   And it is at that moment he began to sing this song, "I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.640]   I have decided to follow Jesus."
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.640]   No turning back, no turning back.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.760]   So when he said, "I have decided to follow Jesus," he's not saying that I'm going to
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:47.960]   go to church on Sunday, that I'm going to give a portion of my wealth, that I'm going
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.520]   to serve the church.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.240]   He was facing death.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.880]   When he says, "No turning back," no turning back, that he wasn't going to surrender this
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:05.840]   new life in order to hold on to the life that was about to be extinguished.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.880]   The second verse says, "Though none go with me, I still will follow."
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.480]   Though none go with me, I still will follow.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.800]   A lot of us wait until revival breaks out.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.920]   They wait until other people confess their faith.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.200]   That I need to be with other people who are passionate for Christ.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.480]   And we're kind of on a holding pattern until you see a movement happening.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.280]   And until there's a movement of prayer, until there's a movement of revival, movement of
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.720]   evangelism, you don't participate.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.960]   Sometimes our greatest hindrances are our own environment, sometimes even in our own
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.680]   churches.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:56.080]   So when he says, "Though none go with me, I still will follow," even if sometimes your
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.880]   greatest hindrance is your own husband.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:07.080]   Because you want to do this with him, but he's not coming, so you're waiting.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   Sometimes it's your own wife.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:14.240]   I want to passionately pursue Christ, but I can't do it with her, so you're patiently
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.360]   waiting.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.240]   Or maybe my children are a little bit older, and I can do this with them.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.840]   Or maybe my friends, or my church, or my leaders.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.800]   And we're just quietly, passively waiting for revival to break out until there's a
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.200]   movement so I can participate in this movement.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:39.320]   But every instance where God calls us, he calls us one by one.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:44.880]   And sometimes it will be many people being called one by one.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.520]   Many times it may just be you.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.520]   Maybe not even with your own family.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.600]   It may just be you.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:58.560]   Though none go with me, I still will follow, though none go with me, I still will follow.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.880]   No turning back, no turning back.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.440]   Third verse, "The world behind me, though crossed before me."
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.160]   As this man was singing this song, when he says, "The world behind me," he's talking
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.520]   about his life, his very breath.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.880]   It's behind me now.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:26.080]   Our greatest desire in this life is not to live a long, peaceful, prosperous life.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:30.560]   That's the rat race that he saved us from.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.160]   It's that rat race that's killing us.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.720]   It's that rat race that's dividing us.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.720]   It's causing contentions in the family.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:45.720]   Sorrow, bitterness, all comes from a result of not letting go of this rat race.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.480]   And so when he says, "The world behind me," he's not simply talking about having nice
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.320]   things and good things and reputation.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:56:00.160]   He says, "No, this whole thing that is under the judgment of God is no longer a pursuit
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.440]   as a priority.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.960]   The world behind me."
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.160]   And so now my pursuit is to cross before me.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.120]   No turning back, no turning back.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:19.360]   So this morning as we sing this song, that this would be our confession, even though
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:27.240]   we may not be practicing it perfectly, that this has to be our pursuit.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:35.640]   To make 2022 a year where you are deliberately, specifically, and passionately pursuing Christ
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:47.160]   above everything else, above your job, above your marriage, above your children, above
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:55.400]   your career, to make the pursuit of Christ the most important thing that I do every single
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.200]   day.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:04.400]   So why don't we rise up together, and as we sing this song, may it be our proclamation,
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.880]   may it be our confession for this coming year, 2022.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
