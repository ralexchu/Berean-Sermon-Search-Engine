[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.040]   >> Hi, everybody.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.560]   Let's take our seats now.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.160]   Start coming back.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:54.200]   I know we had a nice kind of longer lunch break.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   Really appreciative of our BAM logistics team.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.000]   Let's give them a big round.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.240]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.640]   >> People were like, in and out,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.760]   we can afford that?
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.400]   >> [LAUGH] >> And then it was so
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.800]   efficient that, typically for 130 people to get food alone just takes like
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.000]   30 minutes line, but everybody was done eating by like 1230, so.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.880]   It went very smoothly.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.400]   And then I know we had kind of a nice gap where you guys could talk and hang out.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.800]   I know that some people, that kind of downtime and loitering is really painful.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520]   For others, I believe lifelong friendships were made.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.200]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.480]   >> Those are good times just to get to
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.560]   know each other better and hang out, and I hope that it has been.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560]   Again, having extended and quality time together, it's a precious thing.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.000]   Okay, a couple announcements wise.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800]   So right now we're entering into a mini talk plus Q&A.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.920]   Okay, so number one, here's my phone number,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.720]   because you can just text me just questions pertaining to,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.400]   A, if you've ever been confused about the concept of God's holiness.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.800]   For us as good students of the scriptures, it's always good to ask questions.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.600]   So please ask related to concepts of God's holiness.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   If you have questions about, okay, well, nevertheless,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   we did talk about understanding God's holiness has a natural
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.800]   ramifications of what we're gonna do and not do.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   So if you've ever wrestled with gray areas in life, this is a good opportunity
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.480]   that we do Q&A because of that, because sometimes there are areas that are grayish.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.120]   If you even have questions about even advice that you would like for
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360]   scenarios, you can send that over.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.440]   And I promise you I will not disclose, like, so Mike Tice asks.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.160]   [LAUGH] I promise you that it's just gonna be kept anonymous, okay?
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.480]   So there's the number.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800]   Feel free to think about questions related to things that are relevant
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.360]   in case scenario to you, but also even conceptually and applicationally, okay?
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.800]   Great.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.080]   Then, if you would turn your Bible to Galatians chapter 5,
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.280]   I'm gonna read to us a section, and then we're going to do a quick mini talk, okay?
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.880]   Quick mini talk.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.120]   All right, and we're gonna start in verse 16.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:37.800]   So Galatians 5, verse 16, very well-known passage,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.920]   distinguishing for us what it looks like to walk by the spirit.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.560]   And so verse 16 says, but I say, walk by the spirit and
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.280]   you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.000]   For the flesh sets its desire against the spirit, and
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.200]   the spirit against the flesh.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.640]   For these are in opposition to one another, so
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.160]   that you may not do the things that you please.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.080]   But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.200]   Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.360]   impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.000]   strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, and factions.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.040]   Envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these of which I forewarn you,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.680]   just as I have forewarned you,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.800]   that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.480]   But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.360]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.760]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.680]   Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.200]   with its passions and desires.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.800]   If we live by the spirit, let us also walk by the spirit.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.840]   Now let's take a moment to pray.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.880]   Heavenly Father, we continue always to ask that whenever,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.760]   Lord, we are being taught by the scriptures,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.320]   we pray your spirit will illumine that scripture to us.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.320]   Help us to both understand, but also to, yes, feel, and
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.520]   then to be convicted and apply.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   I pray, Father Lord, that we would be strengthened by your word.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.160]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.880]   Okay, so I am gonna do audience participation.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.240]   And I know some of you guys hate it when I do this stuff, but
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.920]   I'm gonna call on some people to come up here and answer some questions with me.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.680]   Okay?
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.080]   [LAUGH] It's like, a shoe with no eye contact, okay?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.360]   All right, so I'm gonna just scan the room from my left, and
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.040]   I just invite you to come up.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.440]   Some guys that I sometimes like to pick on.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.280]   I see Billy over there, come on up, Billy.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.640]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400]   >> And then, I know he's always down.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.440]   Look at that excitement.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.880]   As he comes towards the front.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.600]   And then on my right, I got Sam.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.400]   Come on up, Sam.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.960]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.880]   >> All right, so please come on up here.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.600]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   >> Okay, so please,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.680]   if you would just take a moment to introduce yourself and
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.520]   give the people just one interesting fact about yourself first.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.020]   Come on up.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.480]   >> My name is Billy, and interesting fact,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.160]   I don't know, I grew up in Texas.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.120]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.800]   >> That's it, that's it.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   >> Okay, so my question to you is,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.640]   there is no right answer, and I want you to, I didn't prepare you because I just
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.080]   want you to respond with one of those kind of word association ways, right?
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.840]   So, being that we are in our singles ministry, a lot of times,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.240]   if you guys ask me for advice on dating, I say, a huge part of the game of dating
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.600]   is your ability to correctly, appropriately, and realistically assess a person.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.360]   Is this person holy?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.640]   So my question to you is, when you take a moment to evaluate somebody, and
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.120]   you're thinking, wow, that girl is holy, right?
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.680]   What is the first thing that comes to your mind?
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:32.680]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.440]   >> Like what I see in them, or like what?
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.940]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.320]   >> Like someone who has a pattern of serving the church?
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.600]   >> Service to the church.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.880]   Good answer, good answer.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.320]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   >> Okay, so please also introduce
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.960]   yourself and give us just what you're up to in life these days.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.160]   >> Hi, I'm Sam, and these days I'm sitting in a room for many hours working.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.640]   I work in marketing, so that's why.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.400]   >> Now I'm gonna give you an option of two
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.640]   questions, okay?
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.280]   So you could take the same question.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   When you see a guy, and then you're just like, wow, that guy is holy, right?
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.360]   What is the first thing that comes to your mind?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.160]   But also, if you see a guy and you're like, that guy is so unholy,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:35.640]   what is something that's just like a massive just turn off because it's so ungodly?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.240]   What would be your first thought when you think of, wow, that's really unholy?
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.480]   >> It's an easy question.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.520]   >> Okay.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.480]   >> I think about that all the time.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.000]   No.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.960]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.920]   >> Mine's related.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.480]   It's humility and pride.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.160]   >> Mm, okay, good answer.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.800]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.000]   >> You're good.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.360]   Okay, ten points for each of you, okay?
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.600]   All right, now I had to ask this question.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.280]   It's like when we think of holiness, again, we have good preconceived notions
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.160]   because we've been studying the scriptures, we've been coming to church.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.440]   And we recognize that certain aspects of your life really mark you as a holy
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.960]   individual who is dedicated to God or somebody who's just like, wow,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.160]   you're very fleshly, right?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.080]   And when you think about it, it's the service aspect of it.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.520]   If you see somebody who is selfish, right?
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.480]   It's like, if that doesn't have anything to do with me, I'm not doing it, right?
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.920]   Unwilling to serve another individual, how come you're not doing something for me?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.680]   Right?
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.080]   That's very ungodly because of the whole orientation of the selfish attitude,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.960]   right?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.480]   And likewise, every single one of us, we recognize that when it comes to the topic
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.840]   of humility and pride, it is truly the, I guess,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.880]   the two routes of life ambition that you can take.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.160]   You're either going to seek your success, and
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.480]   we've been hearing it from the pulpit on Sundays, right?
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.680]   Wow, what a powerful message we heard on Sunday.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.320]   You're either going to always presume that everyone's will for
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.120]   your life should be my success, right?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   My provision and my security, and then you just include God into it.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.160]   Or you're going to think on a completely different level and
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.080]   playing where it's, no, no, no, it's God's glory, right?
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.160]   The fulfillment of God's plan, his exaltation at whatever cost.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.200]   And those are two entirely different spectrums, okay?
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.720]   I wanted to talk about that, and I read you this passage because there are some
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.200]   other things that I like to highlight, okay?
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.960]   And what I like to highlight is that, to me,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.800]   what is kind of like a mantra of the scriptures
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.040]   is you see it and you believe it, okay?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.160]   You see it and then you believe it.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.680]   And what I recognize is, in terms of an individual who is evidently godly,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:15.280]   evidently holy, is then an individual who has seen what we talked about in the morning.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.480]   Right?
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:23.720]   He's caught a glimpse of like, God is just so big, right?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.960]   And he can't help now but to stare because he's everywhere, you know?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:38.000]   And that individual who has a massive vision of God is growing in his holiness, okay?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.240]   Scripture actually says, my people, they die, right?
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.480]   They essentially destroy themselves for a lack of knowledge of me.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.800]   And what the scripture says is, when you have that knowledge, however,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.120]   the lack of knowledge will lead to your doom.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.280]   But when you have that knowledge, it is so difficult to turn away, and so
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.840]   your heart then is inclined.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.000]   And you have to believe it, okay?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.760]   In that way, you know how this morning there was this exhortation like,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.200]   set Christ apart in your heart, right?
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.840]   Sanctify him as Lord in your heart is what it said in 1 Peter 3, verse 15.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.520]   Well, the exhortation there, there's a sense to which you can sit there and
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.640]   then start divulging like, what does that mean to set apart and then da-da-da-da-da.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.600]   But scripture talks about there is this very simple devotion,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.400]   there's a simplicity, right, to the holiness that we're trying to pursue.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.960]   What I'm talking about is ultimately,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.120]   if your heart is bent on seeing and loving Jesus,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.160]   you're gonna radically grow in the holiness and pragmatics of your life.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.680]   And that's why I read to you Galatians, so look back at Galatians chapter 5.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.880]   He talks about this basically two conflicting tensions.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.040]   And what he says is, walk by the spirit and you will not carry out, what?
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.360]   The desires of your flesh.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.480]   For the flesh, it sets its desire against the spirit, and
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.960]   the spirit against the flesh.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.920]   For these are in opposition to one another, so
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.640]   that you may not do the things that you please.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.840]   But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law, okay?
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.520]   And what you have here is essentially, yes,
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.320]   there is this complex battle, the epic yin and yang.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.760]   It's not really, but that's how it feels sometimes.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.160]   Where the flesh wants what it wants.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.400]   It wants its pleasures, it wants its desires, it wants its ambitions,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.040]   it wants its successes now.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.000]   But there's the spirit, right?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.920]   With desires for the things that are godly, things that are eternal,
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.520]   things that are heavenly, things that will exalt the Lord.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.680]   And these two things are in opposition to each other.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.160]   I believe sometimes people ask questions of like,
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.200]   how do I do this and how do I do that?
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.080]   But I think you and I know that ultimately, much of scripture will tell you,
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.520]   if that first step you're able to surrender your bent,
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.880]   your desire, and your longing, you're gonna win.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.000]   You're gonna walk in the spirit.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.280]   If you're willing to relent on whatever expectation that is worldly and
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.640]   fleshy, if you're willing to let go of that desire in your heart that says,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.520]   I must have this to be happy, there's a lot of hope for you, okay?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.280]   Scripture is very, very clear.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.680]   Like there's, yes, is it complicated on how to do this and how to do that?
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.200]   Yes, but what scripture talks about is, actually, the man who's very,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.640]   very strong, there's a man who can control this little guy in here that says,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.240]   I want what I want.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.520]   And that's why in Book of Proverbs it says,
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.160]   the man who has self-control is actually mightier than the man who overtakes cities.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.680]   There's a kind of strength that just, when you can control this, man,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.400]   a lot of opportunities open up for you.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.520]   But unfortunately, what I found in this generation is a lot of people talking
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.160]   about the frustration so hard, da, da, da, da, da.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.400]   And a lot of times in the moment of the frustration, in the moment of that feeling
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.600]   like it's so tiring just fighting against your flesh and the desires of your heart,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.000]   they turn around and almost feel like it's a noble thing to follow this passion.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.920]   And I wanna talk about that a little bit.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.720]   Again, you guys know I kinda like teasing and using the dating analogy.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.880]   Sometimes when a guy comes to me and we start talking about stuff and
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.200]   then we get into the conversation about dating, it's not every time,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.160]   just sometimes, right?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.720]   I like to tease and I'm like, who do you like, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.800]   And then when they say, I like so and so, sometimes I like to tease and
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.480]   I'll ask them, isn't it tiring when you want something so bad?
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:06.520]   [LAUGH] But there you are, not knowing what to say, what to do.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.360]   Isn't it tiring, this chase?
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.120]   They're like, yes, it is.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.760]   [LAUGH] And then I tease and I say, you gotta do something about that.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.440]   They're like, yeah, maybe I should.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.560]   And I go, fail.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.240]   [LAUGH] You can't just ask somebody out or do something because you're tired.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.000]   What are you thinking?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.120]   Sometimes you just gotta set people up for failure.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.960]   It humbles us.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.200]   [LAUGH] And it makes us think about life in total, okay?
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.800]   Now I'm being facetious here, but more so what I'm talking about here is,
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.160]   I think we recognize, the reason why I bring that up is because
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.000]   sometimes we're very frustrated with ourselves because, again,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.640]   admittedly so, topics like dating.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.880]   I don't just talk about it just cuz it's fun, but
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.960]   because I recognize it is an absolute reality that we end up thinking about it
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.640]   a lot and so it takes a ton of space in our real estate of our mind, right?
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   And some of us are very frustrated because I would like to not think of it, but
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.120]   it's just there, right?
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.720]   How do we fight that?
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.840]   And then it's not just dating because if we're not able to control that,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.760]   then the next thing will just come along.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.640]   It could be, again, desires for a certain kind of lifestyle.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   Median American living, right?
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.160]   Average America.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.280]   It could be, if some of you guys, you're in the thick of it where you long to
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.320]   purchase a home and you realize, my goodness, staring at Redfin,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.480]   three hours can go by like this.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:44.200]   You recognize just the pull and it's so evident, as this passage would say, right?
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.600]   And so my mini kind of talk here is thinking through, yes,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.800]   the battle for holiness is an ongoing battle that is difficult.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.000]   Yes, that battle for holiness can take lots of different shapes.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.680]   Different moments will come at us in just basically different faces.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.360]   But ultimately, there's a simplicity to it, right?
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.160]   And that simplicity is revealed to us here.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.880]   The fruit of your flesh, it all comes from this desire of I want what I want, though.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.560]   And a lot of times, we're going to wrestle with the thought of not sometimes brazen,
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.360]   like I'm just gonna have it, I don't care what you say, God.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.800]   To the, well, I'm gonna try and see if I can get it no matter,
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.960]   like whatever way possible while not compromising.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.440]   And then a lot of times we'll say, well, conditionally, if I could have both,
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.920]   both the very, very godly person with all the superficial stuff,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.440]   all combined to a nice package, I want that.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.400]   [LAUGH] We're gonna put it into different words, but
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   ultimately it comes down to that kind of fight.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.720]   Your desires will make all kinds of rationalizations.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.600]   It'll take different shapes and forms and sizes.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.520]   But ultimately, he will ask us the question, by the power of the spirit,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.000]   can we relent in the desires of our heart?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.360]   Because the desires of your heart show you quite often,
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.040]   more evidently, how holy you are, right?
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.400]   I'm gonna repeat this phrase because I think it is appropriate.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.720]   A lot of times people will say, you are what you eat, okay?
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.680]   What goes into you, that's what you become.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.640]   Biblically speaking, you are what you desire, right?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.040]   You're going to end up, so long as you desire the Lord,
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.600]   you're gonna desire to imitate him.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.040]   So long as you desire the world, you will follow after the world pattern.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.480]   You will become what you long for.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.560]   And the desires of your heart and the affections of your heart,
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.640]   that a lot of times shows you a greater picture of how mature you are,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.360]   how superficial you are, or how holy you are, amen?
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.520]   Let's take a moment to pray over that brief talk.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:05.560]   Heavenly Father, we wish sometimes that we could just take a hold of our heart,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.280]   you know, dig into our soul and just grab onto all those stubborn,
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.000]   resilient, fleshly desires we have.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.360]   Desires for recognition, desires to please people,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.240]   desire for success and ambition, desires for earthly gain,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.080]   desires for lust and sexual pleasure.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.480]   The list can go on, Lord.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.680]   The list can just keep going on.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.720]   But I pray, God, that you will teach us what it means just step by step,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.360]   one thing at a time, to surrender our ambitions, our desires,
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.640]   not simply to relent, but to surrender those things,
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.320]   and then fully buy into your desires.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.360]   I pray, Father God, that the longings of our heart, the meditations,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.040]   the fantasies, that these things will be godly,
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.120]   that these things will be holy.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.840]   I pray, Father God, from the beginning portions of our minds,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.920]   what we picture to be good, pleasing, joyful, and success for us,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.640]   that inside the sanctuary of our minds, it would be pure.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.040]   And I pray, Father God, that you would help us in that end,
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.600]   that from internally, the things that we long for
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.240]   would be pleasing to you.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.840]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.240]   Amen.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.120]   Okay.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.920]   So, we're going to move now into a time of Q&A.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:36.360]   And again, please feel free to message about topics of,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.200]   if you've ever been confused about like,
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.960]   what conceptually does this aspect of holiness mean?
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.400]   Or there are a lot of questions about,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.520]   hey, where is the balance of legalistically forbidding some things
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.400]   versus allowing there to be, right, like room for you to live
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.040]   and work out your salvation with fear and trembling?
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.880]   So, any of those questions would be okay.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.720]   I'm going to tackle a question pertaining to,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.160]   is it sinful, okay, is it holy to want to retire early?
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.360]   Okay, to want to retire early.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:23.480]   And I like this question a lot because I think it touches upon something
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.640]   that really is for us living here in Orange County in America,
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.320]   we have to keep an eye out for.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.720]   If we're just being watchful, we really have to keep an eye out for.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.440]   Meaning, at some spectrum of your longing and desire,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:46.840]   it turns into an unholy desire or a permissible desire, right?
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.720]   And along with it comes a lot of different things
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.120]   that we've been talking about recently.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.800]   So, what I'm talking about is,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.360]   you can move things around for financial gain
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.280]   so that you can have lots of privileges and opportunities.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   And what I'm specifically talking about for us,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.520]   a lot of people have been talking about,
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.320]   dude, do you want to pack up and plant a church in Texas, right?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.160]   Or I heard, oh man, I can't remember the name of the city.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.520]   Somebody told it to me, I guess in Nevada,
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.600]   just like a click north of Las Vegas,
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.960]   there's like an Irvine of Nevada,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.000]   where it's like pre-planned cities, very clean, highly controlled, right?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.240]   And so, and a lot of businesses.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.280]   So, Irvine is pretty unique in that it has a lot of youthfulness,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.120]   young families love it, great schools, tons of businesses,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.800]   and essentially it's one of the safest places in the country.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.640]   Like crime rate is very, very low.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.400]   So, to be here, actually speaking,
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.160]   we're not trying to brag in any way,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.600]   but in many ways, we're like highly, highly privileged
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.800]   to live here in Orange County, right?
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.280]   We are, objectively speaking.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.280]   Okay, that being said, still nevertheless,
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.080]   nevertheless, people have this thought,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.840]   but if I go to Nevada,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.280]   I could have potentially all that plus less taxes, right?
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.960]   Plus, I could have all that plus X, Y, and Z.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.520]   Now, the question is, is that godly and holy?
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.040]   Okay, so this is where it,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.680]   because the question asks, is it sinful?
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.320]   Okay, that's the tough one, okay?
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.280]   It kind of, and my answer is going to be,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.680]   well, it kind of depends.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.640]   And sometimes, something doesn't have to be entirely sinful
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.880]   to be foolish.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.640]   Sometimes, something doesn't have to be entirely sinful
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.480]   to be a compromise in your heart.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.720]   And then also, sometimes, I can't say
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.480]   that's compromise for all people in all scenarios, right?
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.640]   Okay, but I want you guys to think about this
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   on a certain level, which is, yeah, like number one,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.200]   there's a ton of people who, for the sake of their family,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.360]   jettisoned everything and immigrated to the US.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.640]   Is that bad and evil?
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.880]   No, you have to consider that, right?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.960]   But then there's this other question.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.000]   If you happen to live in one of the most safest,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.640]   prosperous cities, not only in the country,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.080]   but in the world, and yet you feel like you have to move
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.800]   in order to actually obtain to a lifestyle
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.720]   that you'd prefer, then now you have to start
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.200]   asking some questions.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.680]   And the question is mainly,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.320]   what are you actually pursuing then, right?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.280]   And there's this question.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.560]   Sometimes, people ask, and I ask them,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.200]   I ask people a lot of times, like, okay,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   what else is there for you?
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.640]   Do you have family members that you're trying
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.040]   to minister to?
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.240]   Is there a church you're trying to help build?
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.480]   Was there a godly ministry that was doing effective
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.720]   ministry to the community?
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.640]   Like, was there any further thought?
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.560]   Because another rationale could be,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.120]   well, I'm moving to India because there happens
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.240]   to be a community that's trying to be built
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.440]   to do ministry out there, and I'm gonna jettison
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.000]   all the rest of these safeties and actually put myself
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.120]   at a greater risk.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.800]   That actually makes a lot of spiritual sense.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.080]   The rationale has spiritual sense behind it.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.240]   But the rationale behind, I don't know about
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.200]   if there's a church out there.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.840]   I don't know, actually, I have no family out there.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.080]   I don't have a community out there,
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.200]   but what they do have is a house that I can afford.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.240]   That makes human sense, and therefore,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   you can call that human wisdom,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.700]   but you cannot call that spiritual wisdom.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.560]   You can't.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.160]   At best, you can call it human wisdom, which matters,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.920]   but you can't call that spiritual wisdom.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.080]   And then, I would say, if to you,
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.360]   the only reason why that's a possibility is,
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.400]   well, I'll go see if there's a good church out there.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.200]   I'll go see if I can do ministry out there.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.680]   Then that means you have a plan,
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.000]   and then you hope that circumstantially,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.600]   it makes sense spiritually.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.480]   What would that be like?
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.040]   That would be like a guy pursuing a girl
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.560]   because she's beautiful on the outside.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.840]   He knows nothing about how she's on the inside,
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   but he hopes, he hopes it'll work out.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.980]   Someone would have to tell me the difference
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.280]   between the two, right?
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.800]   Between a man chasing a girl because she's beautiful,
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.560]   but he doesn't even know what she's like on the inside.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.160]   That's kind of risky business, actually.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.280]   And then, from a leadership standpoint,
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.000]   like if you're a man of the house and you got your family,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.640]   I think it's great leadership to lead your family and say,
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.860]   hey, I know we could have X, Y, and Z.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.260]   I know you'd be more comfortable,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.000]   but for the sake of the gospel,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.740]   we're not going to take those opportunities.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.580]   Why?
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.240]   Because that could potentially compromise us,
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.920]   as opposed to you explaining,
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.000]   I know we're moving, I know we're leaving community,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.620]   I know the kids have their schooling here,
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.880]   I know the da-da-da-da-da,
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.760]   I know the wife has her community and the sisterhood,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.100]   but we're going to uproot all that stuff,
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.540]   and I hope you find it.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.800]   I'm not sure how I could show the wisdom
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.720]   in my rationale as a leader.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.240]   The question then also asked a question
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.600]   about the retiring early.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.680]   The answer again then is,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.880]   no, it is not sinful to seek retirement early.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.040]   However, there is this question about
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   how much risk will you take for your spiritual well-being
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.500]   if so much of your investment is wanting to make sure
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.720]   that you can do X, Y, and Z in the future
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.200]   while you pay the price now?
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.100]   We're going to all pay the price at some point.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.960]   It's the whole issue of pay the price much later
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.520]   or pay the price now, right?
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.900]   You're going to do the expenditures now
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.080]   or you're going to do it later?
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.140]   That's the game, and there's wisdom in that.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.800]   So again, please don't get me wrong.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.080]   If let's say somebody here decided like,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.240]   I'm moving for a job though, is he mad?
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   Like, is he going to be upset?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.080]   It's like, no, case by case,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.740]   you have various circumstances, you can't help, right?
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.260]   But the desire to retire early,
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.120]   there is this kind of sentiment,
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.460]   huh, I'm not sure if,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.960]   like, if this is one of those scenarios where
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.360]   the path of you wanting to exalt Christ,
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.140]   you wanting to serve the Lord,
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.520]   you wanting to build his church, edify the saints,
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.340]   and evangelize those individuals who are desperately lost,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.140]   there is a question of,
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:38.140]   is any of you retiring early going to contribute to that?
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.260]   And if it is, great, right, great.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.020]   There are people who plan well and when they retire,
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.040]   they're like all out for just writing Christian stuff,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.680]   doing evangelism, going and sharing, great.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.940]   But if this is more so on the line of like,
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.020]   oh, but then I can't do overlanding
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.980]   and camp trips on the weekends until I get to that point
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.300]   where I don't have to be in the office anymore.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.520]   Yeah, then the rationale is really tough, right?
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.860]   Again, for those of you guys who like going camping,
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.940]   I have no problem with the camping.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.340]   I went camping two weeks ago.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.300]   But the idea again here is,
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.280]   both on the level, again, you guys understand,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.800]   I think, so let me just wrap that up.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.640]   It's a long answer.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.320]   Oh man, if I do this for every question,
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.120]   we're not gonna finish.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.880]   But the reason why I spent some extra time on it
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.560]   is because you guys understand,
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.480]   right now there are like social justice issues,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.880]   there are like racial issues.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.600]   These are all very important to talk about.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.060]   But another thing to really talk about is,
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.900]   how much are we compromised in our thoughts
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   that I must secure a financially median version of America
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.340]   in order for me to be godly?
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.840]   That's not the case.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.900]   If you see articles that say, a Christian man,
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.500]   he better have like a 401k and life insurance
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.200]   so that his wife's not in trouble.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.660]   Dude, the vast majority of history
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.300]   did not have the privileges we have today.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.160]   And to think that it's godly to have that,
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.020]   you couldn't even boldface say that to an Indian pastor.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.340]   Like, we're gonna, as Americans, go over there
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.060]   and teach them, like, you know what you need to do?
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.180]   It's absurd, right?
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.820]   The scripture does not mandate us
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.680]   to have a median version of America in order to be godly.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.000]   So I actually believe that's a big threat.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.160]   It's a big threat, materialism,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.460]   and a weird sense of what is like normative
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.240]   for the Christian in America.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.020]   I think that's a bigger threat to our sobriety
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.020]   and our sense of like, I'm dedicated to the cause of Christ
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.940]   than is a lot of the issues that are going on,
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.340]   as important as they are.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.840]   So, great question.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.240]   All right.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.060]   Okay.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.360]   Thank you guys for sending in these questions.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.080]   This is a great question.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.820]   And it's a bit more of an internal question.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.840]   So thanks for raising it, which is,
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.640]   hmm, is there a balance between you knowing God
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.240]   relationally as Father, so you respect
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.600]   and worship him as holy God,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.700]   versus being honest and open with him, right,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.180]   while you do that, so that when you're honest and open,
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.080]   you're actually able to even disclose
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.100]   some of the things that are in your heart, right?
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.940]   So that's a great question, because sometimes,
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.580]   I have heard two extremes.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.700]   I went to a conference one time,
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.100]   and the pastor told the congregation,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.800]   pray sinfully!
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.100]   We're all sinners.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.620]   You're not fooling nobody, right?
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.300]   Just pray in your sin, and pray sinfully.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.960]   Now, some of them are like, hmm.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.220]   (laughs)
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.480]   But God says, watch your mouth when you come to me, right?
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.320]   You're treading on holy ground, right?
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.600]   Don't just throw up words.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.680]   He literally commands to watch your words
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.280]   as you come to his throne, yes?
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.180]   'Cause he is king.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.880]   So I listened to that, and then I heard,
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.660]   and I said, okay, okay, he's overstating
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.220]   what he saw in the book of Psalms, right?
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.360]   And then, there's the other part, though.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.780]   It's like, well, I guess the only thing we can say
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.800]   is, majesty, majesty, holy, holy, holy, I surrender.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.060]   But then, you've never really dealt with
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.620]   what's actually in your heart.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.720]   And for me, as a counselor, and as a pastor,
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.240]   I love it when people feel comfortable enough with me
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.040]   where they can say, okay, unfiltered thought,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.880]   this is the junk I have.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.080]   I'm gonna barf on the table.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.280]   Can you help me sort it out, right?
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.880]   And then, I'm like, ooh, yeah, this is gross,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.280]   but let's sort this out, you know?
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.360]   (laughs)
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.260]   So, this is what I'm gonna say.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.100]   Is there a balance?
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.660]   And the answer is, there is.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.420]   There is a balance.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:17.220]   So, I love Psalm 73, because Psalm 73 is just like,
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.940]   Lord, where are you?
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.100]   Look at these wicked people.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.660]   They're like, prospering.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.900]   And far be it from you.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.140]   Like, this isn't fair, you know?
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.560]   And look at these prideful people.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.060]   They just lift up their words to you,
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.820]   and then they just prosper in this land,
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.420]   and there's like, no consequence for them.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.500]   And then, what he does, though, is he reveals all that,
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.600]   but he takes what I like to call due diligence
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.140]   to not stop there.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:44.000]   And then, he says, but I'm gonna enter into your presence,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.200]   into your sanctuary, and then, I'm corrected.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.140]   And his attitude is humble.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.120]   And then, he admits, when I'm not thinking straight,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.160]   and I'm just speaking, I'm going to betray
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.560]   the generations after me, and then, he says,
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.060]   I was like a dumb beast.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.120]   And then, he says, I know you're a sovereign.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.340]   And then, so he goes to the due diligence
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.980]   of working through all the truths he knows about God, right?
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.720]   I think, in that way, you do have a balance there.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.500]   You go through the process of working through
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.740]   your actual thoughts and sentiments,
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.920]   but you're also making sure that you do not just
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.780]   toss it up as like, this is how I feel.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.780]   What you gonna do about it, God, you know?
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.820]   Sorry, I can't do the attitude thingy very well.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.580]   But if we do that, that entire attitude, obviously,
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.940]   is gonna get squashed.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.140]   It's arrogant.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:38.140]   So, that to us, kind of, is an important process
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.820]   for us to go.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:40.660]   Okay.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.540]   Great.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:48.600]   There is a question about, okay,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.820]   in this day, media addiction is like a real thing,
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.460]   and there's an age-old question.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.500]   Is it actually okay to watch, let's say,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.860]   a lot of R-rated movies, a lot of violence,
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.420]   and it's difficult to watch without promiscuity these days?
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.580]   Okay?
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.480]   Okay.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.720]   So, this is what I would say.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:17.380]   And here now, again, we're doing a Q&A.
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.580]   I'm not gonna, like, overstate this.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:26.340]   Our Lord Jesus said, "Your eyes is a lamp to your heart."
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.260]   That needs to bear application.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:35.900]   So, I will say, apply that truth somehow, someway.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.380]   If there is no discretion that is different
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.900]   between you and a non-believer
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.100]   as to what you allow into your face,
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.780]   then you haven't applied that verse.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.060]   King David actually says,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.740]   "I will put nothing worthless before me, before my eyes."
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.580]   Right?
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.820]   Nothing worthless.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.940]   I would say there are things
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.380]   that are just as worthless as porn.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.460]   You know what that is?
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.380]   It's MTV Cribs.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.420]   Look and gawk at how much he has, right?
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.620]   Look at how he can spend $700 on a burger, right?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.980]   And then you watch that thing, like,
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.140]   "Yeah, that'd be cool one day."
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.140]   Rationally speaking,
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.740]   what's the difference between that and porn?
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.940]   And so, that's why people call it food porn.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.140]   People call it house porn, right?
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.700]   'Cause in the end, you're vicariously trying
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.940]   to live out something you can't have.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.260]   And you know, deep down inside,
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.220]   if you had it, it would be compromise.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.620]   Okay?
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.980]   Think about that for a moment then.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.700]   And this was so weird to me.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.820]   It's like, I remember a long time ago,
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.900]   this was already years ago,
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.820]   people talking about a very popular TV show
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.300]   that had tons of just raunch sexual material.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.860]   And then people started debating online,
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.620]   and then one side of the debate said,
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.020]   "Dude, it's art.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.900]   It's showing and depicting the severity of the sin of man."
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:01.340]   And I was like, "Eh, I don't know about that.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.620]   What would you say?
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.740]   It's art."
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:07.660]   Art is not a category that is outside
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.060]   of the judgment of God.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.660]   You, as a Christian, we appraise everything spiritually.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.900]   And just to say that it's art,
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.740]   is it now free of judgment?
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.900]   No.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.820]   I judge everything according to God, right?
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.980]   And secondly, it's not just art.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.740]   It's a main product for you to consume
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.780]   and get hooked to so that you keep watching it
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.980]   so they can make money.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.020]   It's not just art.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.940]   And then people on the side would be like,
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.060]   "Yeah, I know the scripture says, right?
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.980]   Like if you even look lustfully at a woman,
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.900]   I know scripture says, right?
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.620]   That your eyes should be holy.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.700]   I know scripture says."
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.220]   And it's like, "Yeah, I don't know what to do with this part."
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.500]   I'm gonna be honest.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.380]   I actually think as a whole, every single one of us,
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.180]   we're actually trying to watch less.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.460]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.940]   Why are we fighting for the right to watch stuff
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.420]   that's questionable?
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.860]   To me, it's just kind of like,
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.780]   I know that could come off as like very extreme,
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.980]   but rationally think through that.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.660]   Like something is so questionable
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.340]   that the non-Christian world wonders
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.780]   whether it's legitimate for children, adults,
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.900]   or anybody to watch.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.620]   'Cause people are wondering, is it questionable
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.500]   for is it okay even to produce?
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.540]   Why would Christians fight for that?
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.020]   Strange to me, very strange.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   So I know I'm talking now in more broad categories.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.740]   I don't wanna get more specific than that
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.540]   because you will have to obviously
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.900]   work out your salvation, work out your thoughts,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.340]   think through what you're gonna allow in
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.460]   and allow also out.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.980]   Because I believe scripture is very clear
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.900]   that it is almost, it's very difficult
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.980]   for us to not get influenced by that kind of stuff.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.900]   And then also, I kind of feel like
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.700]   if an individual says like, yeah, yeah, it's okay,
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.180]   I've been watching, it hasn't affected me.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.740]   I don't think then that individual has experience.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.380]   Trying to counsel a generation
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.300]   where sexual deviance is so rampant,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:19.100]   it's not really in tune with what is actually taking place
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.940]   in the private lives of people, right?
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.900]   If someone is counseling a young man and saying,
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.700]   yeah, you can watch that stuff,
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.300]   it's like, have you counseled young men?
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.420]   Have you counseled yourself in how easily you're tempted?
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.060]   So all those things I think contribute to that thought.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.380]   Okay?
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.220]   Great.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.220]   On that topic, any follow-up questions?
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.620]   Is anyone so bold enough to raise your hand
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.580]   and ask a follow-up question?
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.420]   I'm kidding.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.100]   Okay, okay.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.220]   If you do, though, don't be afraid to raise your hand.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.380]   Okay, I know it's like a larger group or whatnot,
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.900]   but don't be afraid to raise your hand.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.740]   Okay.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.540]   Okay.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:11.300]   Oops.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.820]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.660]   Okay.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.860]   Ah.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.220]   This is a question about some people seem more predisposed
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.700]   to inclinations of holiness and pursuing it.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.140]   How do you increase these inclinations
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.780]   even when you don't feel the desire and motivation?
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.940]   Is it possible to be Christian and not holy?
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   Okay, so there's two questions bound up there.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.500]   And let's answer it actually in reverse order.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:50.500]   So let's do one of those audience participation
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.980]   voting thingies, okay?
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.340]   And we'll see how many hands go up, okay?
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.340]   Question is simply, is it possible to be Christian
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.180]   and not holy?
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.940]   Those who say yes, raise your hand.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:09.060]   Okay, and then answer the question.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.700]   Those of you who say no, raise your hand.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.140]   Okay, so that's really interesting, right?
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.140]   So this past week, we had studied Second Thessalonians,
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.820]   and there was this really challenging passage, right?
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.420]   Keep away from the brother who leads an unruly life.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.140]   It's like, dang, aren't we supposed to love our brother
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.620]   though, you know?
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.220]   And it's a hard passage to apply, okay?
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.620]   But the interesting fact about it is,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.260]   it said, but that's a brother, right?
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.780]   Keep away from a brother, okay?
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.140]   So I want you guys to think about that a little bit,
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.580]   and then think about a lot of our experiences.
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.940]   It is a very, very difficult thing to ask a question.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.420]   I was like, is this possible, is it not?
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.820]   Because the scripture is what it does,
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.700]   is it gives you contributing principles.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.380]   And it's not always so easy to make a determinative answer.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:11.980]   What I mean is, 1 John chapter one is absolutely clear.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.140]   If you say you know God,
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.340]   but you walk in a pattern of darkness,
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.180]   you're an absolute liar, bold-faced liar,
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.940]   and you know you don't know God, right?
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.700]   So 1 John is actually really, really clear.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.740]   An individual who is walking in a life pattern
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:31.260]   where he's comfortable in sin is not a Christian.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.580]   But then, you look at passages
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.060]   even like Second Thessalonians,
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.220]   you look at passages like 1 Corinthians,
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.460]   how does Apostle Paul begin 1 Corinthians?
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.940]   You saints, beloved of God, right?
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.380]   I am confident of things better for you.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.740]   It's weird, so you have multiple principles there.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.180]   And then, I want you to think about even our experience.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.900]   A lot of us who got saved later on in life,
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.340]   when let's say we were in college,
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.420]   or we got saved as a high school senior,
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.420]   something like that,
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.380]   I had a personal experience where I got saved
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.020]   in a really drastic way,
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.300]   where I remember the retreat I was at,
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.620]   I remember the pastor who came
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.060]   and put his hand on my shoulder,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.020]   I remember the questions he asked me.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.740]   He asked me like, "Do you ever regret stuff?"
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.180]   I'm like, "Yes, I've got tons of regrets."
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.260]   Right?
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.540]   Massive amounts of regret.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.260]   I remember him sharing with me the gospel,
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.780]   and I was genuinely saved that evening.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.380]   I broke, I bawled for hours that night, okay?
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.220]   And I loved Jesus to death.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.180]   But I was confused.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.020]   Like, why?
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.500]   Why do I love Jesus, and then so easily sin?
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.980]   And I was doing dumb stuff,
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.540]   because I just, as a young man,
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.740]   I always felt like it was so easy to make,
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:56.060]   the friends that were the easiest to make
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.260]   were the druggies, right?
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.220]   Like, were the guys who drink a lot,
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.340]   the guys who mess around.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.500]   It's like, they're just the funnest
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.700]   and the easiest to hang around with,
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.180]   and so I kept getting caught up with that.
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.780]   And then freshman year in college,
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.820]   I was like, I love the Lord so much.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.060]   Like, I was like, in the dorm,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.540]   the middle of the night, just jamming away,
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.700]   and people were like, "Shut up!"
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.940]   And I was like, "Blessed be the Lord!"
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.460]   Like, I was doing that kind of stuff,
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.700]   but then, on the weekend, I would just be tempted.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.380]   I would wanna, like, I had this weird,
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.660]   like, you know, I felt like I was,
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.820]   I needed to steal stuff.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.660]   Like, I was just weird.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.140]   I had all kinds of sins in me.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.460]   And that's when, for me, it was just this conviction,
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.260]   like, and I didn't know what to do with myself,
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.660]   so I tell this story quite a bit,
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.940]   where, like, I hit a breaking point
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.220]   where, my freshman year in college,
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.580]   I remember I was in this fork in the road,
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.140]   middle of the night, like 1 a.m.,
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.660]   I just went on a long drive,
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.860]   went down to San Diego, went to my old church.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.700]   It was all closed.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.820]   I jumped the fence.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.340]   I went to the door, sanctuary door.
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.180]   I just started crying, like, "God, I don't get it.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.020]   "I love you, but I'm so filthy.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.180]   "I don't get this," right?
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.900]   And there was just this, like, wretchedness
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.100]   that I couldn't grapple with.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:14.180]   So, what I'm saying is, I think our experience tells us
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:19.180]   that we absolutely have this strange paradox
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.820]   where God saves your soul,
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.980]   and then, I love Pastor Peter Chung's illustration,
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.260]   is if you take a shovel and chop off a snake's head,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.140]   its body is just like, (gurgling)
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.540]   right?
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.340]   Is the snake alive or dead?
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.820]   It's weird, right?
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.540]   But that is a lot like our reality when we're saved,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   is our flesh just, like, cries out for a last breath.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.460]   Our flesh actually fights harder to, like,
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.740]   stay alive, so to speak.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.460]   And then, Galatians tells us, like,
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.540]   your flesh, it speaks lies to you,
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.620]   it entices you, and it wants you to keep going
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.060]   in its fleshly pattern to satisfy itself.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.300]   You must walk in the spirit of God, right?
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.780]   So, in that way, you have these multiple principles
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.140]   that exist, that you are, in many ways,
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.300]   the flesh is like the snake with its head cut off.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.940]   And so, can a Christian exhibit seasons
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.460]   of sin and unholiness?
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.100]   The answer is yes.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.740]   But the 1 John passage is very clear,
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.980]   that when you lead a life, and you walk
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.660]   in a certain pattern, you are going to bear its fruit,
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.700]   and what's gonna happen is, eventually,
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.420]   the fruit that is born is the rotten fruit
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:40.420]   of fake salvation, of fake, you know, proclamation.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.820]   Oh yeah, of course, I did that stuff.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.220]   And then you realize it's not real, okay?
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.260]   Now, the second part of it, it asks the question,
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.060]   what if you're not motivated, right?
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.500]   What if you're not motivated?
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.060]   There is so much in scripture, I think,
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.460]   that can motivate us, and I think, today,
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:04.660]   we talked about, let the pain of being far
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:09.380]   from your love motivate you to be more holy, right?
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.900]   If you feel far from God, a lot of times,
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.260]   the reason why some people, like,
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.820]   they feel like nothing's going right is, yeah.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.740]   It's, for example, if my relationship
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.420]   with my wife, it's broken, and it's just,
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.820]   like, in shambles at home, I cannot do this.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.140]   How am I gonna preach?
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.820]   Like, how am I gonna sit there, study my Bible,
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.140]   and like, ooh, this is gonna be good?
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.220]   How am I gonna go home?
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.420]   Nothing in your life is gonna feel right
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.860]   if your relationship with God is messed up.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.260]   Let that motivate you.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.340]   But also, I think, scripture is pretty clear.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.860]   God asks us, you know, sometimes,
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.980]   all we need is a taste, yeah?
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.260]   You feel the goodness and the freedom
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.460]   of not having to come to God all, like,
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.220]   broken in conscience.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.780]   Your conscience is all bothered,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:02.860]   but you feel this freedom, like,
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.980]   I can approach God through Christ, right?
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.740]   The sins that I've committed, I've reconciled in Christ.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.140]   The sins I feel tempted with,
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.660]   I fought in the Spirit through Christ,
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.100]   and I can go to my God with clarity
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.300]   as opposed to hiding stuff.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.260]   That feels so good.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.780]   There's nothing like having open communion with your God,
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.940]   yeah, and I think in that way,
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.940]   let those things be a motivation to you.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.140]   Okay, great.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.780]   Are you guys doing okay?
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.660]   I do hear the chairs, like, creaking a little bit,
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.500]   which means, (laughs)
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.580]   like, okay, yeah.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.500]   All right, we're just gonna go for about another,
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.300]   I think we tackled about four or five questions,
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.700]   so thank you again for sending in the questions,
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:52.300]   and then we'll take a break after that, okay?
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:50:01.220]   Well, this is a question.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.180]   As a sinner who has been saved,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.100]   is it possible to have a desire that is 100% pure,
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.140]   or, like, purely godly,
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.180]   or will even our holy desires be muddled with sin?
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.380]   So, that's really an interesting question.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:23.780]   The way I see it is that
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.580]   experientially, we're going to
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.140]   regularly experience compromise, okay?
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.700]   And a wise man once said,
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.420]   "It's not a matter of are you compromised,
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.820]   "it's a matter of how much," right?
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   Now, what I'm saying there is philosophical.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   It's not necessarily, "Thus says the Lord,
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.740]   "you can never offer up pure intentions to God."
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.780]   What Apostle Paul prays for is
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.780]   he does pray for sincerity of faith, right?
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.620]   Genuine love.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.940]   And when he's talking about that,
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.500]   he wants us to have a pure conscience
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.700]   that's washed regularly.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.740]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.940]   we are so easily aware,
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.660]   so I do kind of picture it on the lines of, like, Peter,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.540]   you know, in the whole walking on the,
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.420]   he was so elated walking on the water,
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.860]   but he was, like, immediately,
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.060]   even while being elated,
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:19.100]   he, like, quickly became aware of himself, right?
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.060]   So I feel like that's an experience
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.100]   a lot of Christians can sympathize with,
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.980]   which is you may have such a pure desire
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:27.300]   to do things for God,
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.820]   and so you're just like,
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.380]   I want to serve this sister,
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.820]   I want to serve this brother out of the genuineness,
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.020]   I genuinely want to love,
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.380]   but the thing about it is,
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.060]   in our flesh, we are very aware
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.900]   of how I look in that person's eyes,
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.540]   my own eyes, and the eyes of the church as a whole,
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.420]   like the community, right?
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.660]   And so I realized, like, oh gosh,
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.340]   there are motives that compete,
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.060]   like, there's a part of me that wants to please God,
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:58.060]   please Him, please you, and then myself, you know?
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.860]   And that comes so instinctually,
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.980]   it's very, very difficult.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.580]   But through practice, through prayer, through humility,
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.940]   every time you do something, you learn, right?
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.340]   I can't, I remember the first time I,
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.900]   like, you know, did this, which is deliver a sermon,
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.620]   and I share about it a lot because it was so,
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.740]   like, profound and deep, you know, for me,
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.940]   which was, that first sermon,
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.340]   because the leaders gave me, like, two months to prepare,
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.180]   I poured my heart out into that thing, okay?
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.780]   And I spent so much time preparing,
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.220]   so I knew it, I knew it.
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.580]   But right after I preached it, number one,
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.420]   I felt my hands kind of shake,
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.460]   and then I felt, number one, this weird regret, like,
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.820]   oh my gosh, I should have said this,
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.740]   oh, so stupid, you know?
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.580]   You guys ever do that?
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.820]   You do something, and then immediately it's like,
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.780]   oh, you start judging yourself, like,
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.340]   I should have said this, I should have said that,
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.820]   it didn't come out right, I'm like,
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.820]   they're not gonna get this, you know?
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.980]   And then someone did it.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.940]   They did it, someone came up and said,
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.620]   thank you for that message.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.180]   And then there was this weird, like,
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.020]   oh, you liked it?
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.500]   You know, like, so dumb, right?
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.020]   Oh, you liked my message?
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.300]   But then, immediately, once I felt the,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.340]   oh, you were blessed by that,
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.140]   the spiritual side came in and was like,
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.380]   don't touch God's glory, right?
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.380]   You gotta be saying, like, it's the word of God, you know?
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.020]   Yeah. (laughs)
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.460]   And then, but it was gonna sound super awkward,
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.700]   and I didn't wanna sound awkward, so I'm like,
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:38.260]   shrugs, you know, like, what do you say?
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:42.020]   So I remember distinctly all that happened, you know?
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.980]   And I remember wanting to talk about the sermon
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.540]   with Bea on the ride home, but then being afraid,
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.260]   because I was like, do I ask her
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.380]   what she thought about the sermon?
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.540]   Because if she didn't like it, then I'm done, you know?
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.180]   Like, I can't be a pastor anymore.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.820]   My wife doesn't like my own sermons, you know?
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.780]   I mean, my mind was racing.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:03.740]   And I realized, I was like, hey, dude, calm down.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.780]   You're a newbie in pastor,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.820]   you're gonna have to grow past this.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.060]   Your first feelings of pride are like,
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.180]   did I preach a good sermon, you know?
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.360]   Did I preach a horrible sermon?
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.220]   My first battle with, like, taking credit for something
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.620]   that's supposed to be spiritual,
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.260]   someone thanking me for a sermon, like,
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.180]   what do you say to that stuff, you know?
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.380]   So I know that's a long way of just kinda describing,
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.540]   but, like, the question is,
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:32.140]   is it possible to have that pure intention?
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.940]   The fact of the matter is, every single one of us,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.700]   like children, we're gonna be growing
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.240]   in even the good things we do
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.860]   with the immediate temptations that come.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:46.860]   And, like, within those moments, yeah,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.620]   the battle against pride is going to be strong
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.860]   and ever-present, you know?
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.120]   A battle against you taking any kind of ambitious credit
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.380]   for that is gonna be ever-present,
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.480]   and so we have to fight that all the time.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.400]   Great.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.600]   Oh, bunch of questions came in just now.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.720]   I'm gonna answer, essentially,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:11.220]   I was gonna just go up to about 2.30, take a full hour.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:15.400]   Oh, can a person be holier than another person?
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.920]   Yes!
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.120]   (laughs)
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.880]   That was so easy, all right.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.920]   Okay, yeah.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.520]   Well, actually, let me talk about that a little bit,
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.360]   because...
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.320]   (laughs)
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.200]   I remember, so now that I've been a pastor
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.200]   for over 10 years, like, there are times
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.520]   when I sat down with young guys who wanted to be pastors,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.760]   and I've also overseen internships and stuff like that.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:47.120]   And, you know, in order to be holy,
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.840]   I remember a young intern saying, like,
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.400]   "Oh, yeah, no one's better than another.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.760]   "Like, I'm no better than you, okay?
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.080]   "We're all just sinners trying to climb this wall,
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.760]   "and I'm next to you, just cheering you on.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.920]   "That's my role."
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.520]   And I said, "Then you're not a leader."
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.000]   Right, it's like, as harsh as that may sound,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.680]   then you shouldn't be doing this.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.840]   Apostle Paul, in the scriptures, in the passage we learned,
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.360]   he said, "I left for you an example."
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.400]   Apostle Paul is human, he's not Jesus, okay?
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.920]   He said, "I left you this model,
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.420]   "intentionally, for you to follow.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.920]   "I left you this example, and I expect you to follow it."
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.160]   Yes?
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.840]   And in that way, good leaders, a lot of times,
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:31.480]   their leadership is shown by the exemplary lives they live.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.440]   And if you're not doing it, then you're not a leader, right?
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.800]   And in that way, as you guys know at our church,
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.680]   we take leadership very seriously,
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.600]   because we recognize that it can do a lot of damage,
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.080]   but it can also do a lot of great good.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.320]   But the question in terms of practical holiness,
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.480]   I absolutely do believe that, yes,
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.840]   clearly, positionally, before the Lord,
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.120]   no individual is worth more.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.960]   No individual is more valuable or more cleansed,
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.120]   because everybody is robed in white of Christ.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.760]   However, on the level of you being a disciple
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.040]   and follower of Christ, he's very, very clear.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.360]   Some of you need greater, greater discipline.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.840]   Some of us need greater, the whole digging into our hearts
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.380]   and unpacking what we're wrestling with.
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:24.360]   And individuals, we have yet to wrestle in prayer
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.040]   to certain things to overcome some of the inner sins
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.680]   that we have, and those are all necessary things
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.480]   we have to grow in, okay?
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.240]   Great question.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:39.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.040]   This is a interesting one.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   Is it sinful to go to a new church that is more palatable?
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.920]   Maybe a church that is more friendly
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.800]   or more ministry geared towards seekers?
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.080]   Maybe because some of your family members is there?
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:02.320]   Is this compromising the seriousness of the place upon,
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.560]   I place upon the church and what is taught?
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.360]   Wow, what a deep question.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.920]   So we'll answer this one, and then take a break,
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.160]   and then that way, some of you guys who could use a break
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.520]   could take a break, okay?
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.520]   Or we could continue on with questions, too.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.200]   This is an interesting one, and
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   (pauses for breath)
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.840]   yeah, what a profound question that is kind of unique
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.600]   to our circumstances where we have options.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:37.120]   Again, just putting into context, many Christians,
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.960]   many of the faithful saints prior to us
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.880]   didn't have options, you know what I mean?
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.360]   They were just dying to have some kind of fellowship,
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.800]   and they didn't have options like we do.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   Now, in that context, though, we do have options,
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:58.120]   and as you can tell, I'm trying to buy time
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.080]   so I can summarize my thoughts.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.600]   We do have options, and this is what I'm gonna say is,
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:10.640]   the truth of the matter is,
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.560]   there are differing levels of importance.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.800]   When I think about a decision,
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.520]   because my mind is an over-thinker,
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.080]   I have to sometimes think in this way,
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.120]   and it takes me time.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.080]   To me, it's like you take different-sized balls,
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.680]   and then you have to put it into this picture
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.280]   to come to a conclusion,
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.760]   but not all the balls are the same size.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.120]   Some things are much more important,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.800]   and it's like that in so many different aspects
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.280]   of your lives, dating, okay?
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.640]   If I tell people, like,
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.520]   yes, you can want a guy who's fun.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.800]   You don't wanna date a robot.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.160]   I totally get it, okay?
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.840]   Some guys are super dry, their humor is dry,
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.360]   and other guys, they're just so witty
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.840]   and so fun to hang around with.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.640]   Is that an important thing to a lot of people?
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.320]   It is, you know?
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.600]   But think about the size of significance in that
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   versus a guy who knows that his life
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.080]   is as a slave to Christ, right?
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.680]   Versus one of the great sins that men deal with is pride,
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.200]   how much pride comes out.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.080]   Another sin that men deal with is anger,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.800]   how much of our temper do we control, okay?
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.840]   'Cause we get offended and mad pretty quickly, right?
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:25.280]   So how did you size this stuff, okay?
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.560]   But it's the same question for church.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.040]   A church has to be dedicated to the glory of God
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.440]   through all of its programs.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.200]   A church has to be dedicated, therefore,
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.840]   to the teaching of truth,
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.520]   because without the teaching of truth,
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.560]   you're never gonna connect,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.360]   and so right there, I'm gonna stop
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.160]   because you already know BCC class one.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   We have a fourfold vision that is utterly important
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.000]   to the Christian faith and their involvement in a church,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:53.960]   right?
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.200]   So that being the case,
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.880]   you have to size those pieces appropriately,
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.320]   and then after sizing those pieces, you realize,
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.280]   okay, but the church, actually,
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.580]   I differ on the topic of eschatology.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.840]   The church, I differ on the topic of spiritual gifts.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.120]   The church, I differ on X, Y, and Z,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.200]   and you find that as a significant amount of thing
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.600]   that you want to leave.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.240]   There are plenty of people who come to church.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.000]   You guys know that I oversee the membership process.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.320]   I've sat down with them, prayed with them,
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.080]   and said, "The Lord bless you."
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.680]   As a brother of a brother,
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.160]   what a joy to just connect with you in this way.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.560]   I wanna bless you on your way.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.000]   Let me recommend you to this church
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.280]   that I know has strong biblical doctrine
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.640]   'cause that's so important.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.840]   Let me recommend you to this church
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.080]   because that pastor, I know him, he's my friend,
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.640]   and he cares about the soul of the church and congregation.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.280]   He wants to grow you.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.960]   Go there, right?
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.360]   Those things, those pieces are huge.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.720]   So in that way, you make your decision wisely.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.560]   Hope that helps.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.960]   Yeah, hope that helps.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.160]   Great.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.480]   So what we're gonna do right now
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.720]   is take a 10-minute break or so.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.600]   Let me pray for us,
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.520]   and then for any of you guys who want to
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.640]   just continue to ask questions or just hear questions,
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.400]   I'm just gonna be up here at the front,
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.560]   and you guys can just come forward,
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.400]   and we'll just talk about stuff, okay?
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.240]   All right, let's pray.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.280]   Heavenly Father,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   God, I thank you so much.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.040]   I just talked for an hour straight.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:31.280]   And I thank you, God, that we have things to talk about
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.600]   because, Lord, your scripture gives us so much wisdom.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.200]   Lord, it is our prayer that every single one of us here,
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   Lord, it's our prayer that you would lead us in wisdom,
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.680]   thinking deeply, intentionally about the decisions we make,
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.920]   understanding, Lord, your principles,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.840]   and then, just like in Proverbs,
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.720]   we hear the wisdom of the wise,
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   we hear the godly principles, but to learn to apply them.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.640]   And I ask, Lord, that for all of us here
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.560]   as young individuals trying to establish our path,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.000]   may it truly be according to the path
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.720]   you have lit with your word.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.040]   I pray, Father God, that we would desire
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.600]   to ask the question, Lord, is this according to your wisdom?
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.160]   And I pray, Father God, that we would wrestle
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.800]   against the wisdom of our own flesh
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.880]   and the wisdom of the world
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.240]   'cause, Lord, we know the world speaks loudly.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.120]   It's obnoxious.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.040]   But I pray, Father God, that you would help us
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.720]   incline our ear to your truth.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.080]   And I pray, Father God, that even the things
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.800]   that don't seem normal,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.960]   even the things that seem hard,
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.000]   we would see the wisdom behind it and abide.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:41.880]   Lord, we thank you again.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.800]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.680]   All right, okay, you guys can have a break.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.480]   And then, after the 10-minute break,
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.640]   our team's gonna come back
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.120]   and give you guys some more instructions.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.800]   And then, I'm gonna just stand right over here.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.280]   If you guys wanna hear more questions
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.480]   and that kind of stuff,
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.760]   just answer more questions you may have, okay?
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.760]   (audience chattering)
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:11.440]   (audience chattering)
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.600]   (audience chattering)
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   (audience laughing)
