[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.360]   as we come before our God, hoping and praying that the Spirit will work
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   in the hearts of our friends, our loved ones.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.360]   So let's continue to pray.

[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   (music playing)
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.360]   The next two prayer requests, the third one is going to be then
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:47.360]   a priority of worship. And the reason why this is a little bit shorter,
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   but there's so much involved in just the priority of worship corporately,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   but also of us personally, we recognize that we can kind of throw around that word "worship"
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.360]   constantly, but at the end, when we think of what worship is, and what we're doing
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   when we come to corporately worship God together, it's simply an extension of what we're called to do
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.360]   minute to minute in our lives. So we don't enter,
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   we don't really enter into times of worship, we do enter into times of corporate worship.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.360]   Corporate worship isn't a time just for personal worship, it's where we come together
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   and remember the God that we serve together. It's an encouragement that happens.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.360]   So for that to happen then, personal worship needs to first be happening.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   My question to you tonight is, has that been happening in your life? How much do we compartmentalize
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   our lives to keep certain things alive and vibrant
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   only when we're able to, you know, we're in front of the word or when we're praying.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   But when we consider things like whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   Is the whole of your life worship? Is the whole of our lives here worship?
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.360]   Have we been, if priority is even the right word, prioritizing that?
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   And maybe it's not so much a need for us to prioritize
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   as it is that when we are genuinely, in spirit and in truth,
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   worshiping God, that there is going to be a weightiness
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   and a certain preciousness to our worship.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   So continue to think through, are we posturing?
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   Are we just playing a role and a part? Even as we're praying tonight,
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.360]   ask yourself, what am I doing?
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:42.360]   Are these real words? When we're singing these songs,
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:47.360]   are those real words of praise and worship towards God? Is it real adoration towards God?
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   Is that what we're doing here tonight? Are we actually
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   adoring God together? Are we loving God more? Is our hearts growing
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   in passion for the Lord? Are we actually
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:07.360]   lifting Him up? Let's guard that and pray for that,
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.360]   that our church would be a church that does that personally and corporately,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   so that when we do come together to worship together, nights like this, when we worship together on Sundays,
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   that those would be such sweet times that it doesn't need to be something I have to do as a Christian
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:27.360]   or something I need to kind of remember I'm supposed to prioritize, but that it becomes
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   a sweet time, a time we look forward to, the best time in our weeks,
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   because we get to worship together as a church.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   Let's then pray for that. Pray that the nights before we would sleep on time, because we're prioritizing
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   that. We want that to be that kind of time for us. Pray that we come
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   on time because we want to prioritize that. Pray that our church, that this room would be
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   filled with people who pray before the service even begins. Pray
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   that our church can be a church that grows steadily
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:07.360]   in this and that we're not okay with just continuing the
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   way we have been, but that we're daily growing, even with the encouragement that there has been
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   for us. Pray also for the protection of the pulpit, for the
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   primacy of God's Word, that this pulpit would be guarded by God
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   and that you can pray even for the people who preach, for the leadership of the church,
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:32.360]   for the elders. Would you pray that God's Word wouldn't be
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.360]   tainted by the sinful lips of men.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   And then the praise team is going to be singing another song. That can be a cue for you, although you can
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   continue to pray for this to move on to upcoming events. There's a lot to pray for.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   There's an upcoming Bible study as we go through those four books, a Bible lab that
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:57.360]   Pastor Mark will be leading. There's going to be the family ministry community
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   groups that are coming up. The men's ministry fellowship is going to be directed specifically on the topic
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:07.360]   of purity. You can pray 20 minutes just for that. Pray for the women's ministry
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.360]   time and the sweet time of fellowship there. I believe the women's ministries also,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   many of them are going to be going through the book Don't Waste Your Life. A lot to pray for there.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.360]   A lot of us are. Pray for the current membership class. There are over 60 people signed up
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   for the current membership class. That's a little crazy. Pray. We need to pray.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:32.360]   As crazy as that might be, we need to pray more for those things and pray for all the participants
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   as they learn and grow. Pray for the FAM 245 workshop.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:42.360]   And then there are three retreats, the youth retreat. Pastor Charlie's going to be preaching on joy in Christ.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:47.360]   Pastor Simon for the BAM on fear of God. Pastor Ian later on in college
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.360]   on the topic of proclaim the name. There are many more things that we could be
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   praying for. I did want to ask us to pray also specifically if we can for
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   Khan and Claire. I know our family ministry has been praying and fasting for them.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   But Claire who has late stage aggressive, she has a thymus cancer and she has a little one at home.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   Pray for Khan as this is just such a difficult time for them and they need our encouragement and prayer.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:25.360]   Pray also please for Janice and Jen. Janice's parents, both of them are together going through chemotherapy at the same time.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.360]   Pray for healing, pray for strength, pray for faith for these church members of ours.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:36.360]   And I only named two. There's so many more that you know of. But if we all pray together,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   we can cover all of these things in prayer. So let's take the next 15 to 20 minutes again.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   And please, I know there are going to be times where your words fail and you lose concentration.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   But battle for this, fight for soberness. In the midst of these prayer requests, pray again
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   that God would help you through this and lean in closer again to God.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   When the songs come out, sing together and when they close, pray again.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:06.360]   And let this be a time where we can be intimate with the Lord together.

[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   Heavenly Father, God at the end of prayer,
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.360]   we know that it does not just close the book
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.360]   for us to go and live our lives.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.360]   Father, this is not only our song,
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   but our desire for the whole of our lives.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.360]   God, not our will, but yours be done.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.360]   Father, that prayer would be perpetual in us.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.360]   God, that we would pray without ceasing.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.360]   God, that our desire would consistently
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.360]   and constantly be yours.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.360]   And Lord, that we would come as grateful people
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   filled with such great gratitude for what you've done for us.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.360]   God, fill us with peace tonight.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   Fill us, God, with more and more contentment
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   and satisfaction in Christ and only in him.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.360]   And in those things that might distract us
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   and take our eyes away, I pray, Father,
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   that there would be a boldness and a conviction inside of us
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.360]   to be able to live our lives the way we desire to.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   That we would not be following after the lusts of our flesh.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.360]   But God, that our desire, Father, would be of the Spirit.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360]   That we would walk in the Spirit.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   That we would pursue you.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.360]   That we would chase after you and the things of your kingdom.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.360]   Help us, Lord, not to limp by in this life,
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   but to be filled with victory, with power, with the Spirit.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.360]   God, that you would consume the whole of us.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.360]   That the world might see the light of the gospel in us.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.360]   That this church, Lord, would be filled with strength
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   that can only come as we abide in a living God.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.360]   So, Lord, thank you that we can do this together.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.360]   And I pray, Father, for all of us,
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.360]   even as we go our separate ways,
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.360]   Lord, that our fellowship would be strong.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   That our lives would be united.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.360]   That our desire would be the same.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360]   Father, not our will, but yours be done.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.360]   So thank you, God, for this time of prayer
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   that we're able to very specifically engage in together
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   over the last hour and a half.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   I pray, God, for more of it.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.360]   Thank you so much for listening to us tonight.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.360]   Well, that's it for the night.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.360]   We can just go ahead and make our way out.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   Go ahead and fellowship.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   You can also spend more time in prayer.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.360]   I know we get used to kind of praying at the end, breaking off.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.360]   But you guys can do that a little bit more organically,
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   if you'd like, as well.
