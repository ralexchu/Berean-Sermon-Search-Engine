[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   And with that, let's turn to verse 12 through 19 and read our section for tonight.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.000]   He says, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you which comes upon
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.960]   you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.360]   But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.800]   at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exaltation.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.440]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.380]   and of God rests on you.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.440]   Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or a troublesome
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.280]   meddler, but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.020]   God in his name.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280]   For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God, and if it begins with
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.600]   us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.420]   And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.200]   man and the sinner?
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.120]   Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.000]   to a faithful Creator in doing what is right."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.640]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.040]   Heavenly Father, we ask again, Lord, that You would continue to work in our hearts through
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.560]   Your Word and the Spirit of God.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.080]   God, washing away all that is worldly, any sin that harbors in our heart, and especially,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.000]   Father God, a thought, a perspective, a worldview that is more manly than it is godly.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.640]   I pray, Lord, that You would wash away those things and continue to renew our minds.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.920]   This we pray in Christ's name.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920]   Amen.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   Okay.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.640]   As we take a look, you see repeatedly through the study of 1 Peter why I'm saying Apostle
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.200]   Peter has been challenging our worldview and perspective.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.880]   Likewise, here, he is challenging your worldview, and in verse 12, he says, "Beloved, do not
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.480]   be surprised at the fiery ordeals among you which comes upon you for your testing as though
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.920]   something strange was happening to you."
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.520]   As though some strange thing was happening.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.440]   And so the command is clear, saying, "Hey, don't be surprised."
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.480]   But as he's saying that, my point is there is a worldview that he's challenging.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.640]   There's almost a question of like, "Why in the world are you surprised?"
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.560]   It is not because of the expectations that we have.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.360]   So the command clearly is, from your worldview, expect it and prepare for it.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.720]   Expect for hardship and suffering to come as a Christian, and be prepared for that.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.960]   Now there's a passage, please turn your Bible to John chapter 15, where Jesus again, I've
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.600]   referred to this before, but I felt like we needed to look at the whole section.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.800]   When Jesus was teaching the disciples, how we shouldn't be surprised by the animosity,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.280]   the kind of pressures that we experience from the world around us.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.520]   As a matter of fact, he tells you, you should actually think of it as like, "That's reasonable.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   We'll take a look."
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.400]   Starting from verse 18 to verse 25, John chapter 15.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.340]   He says, "If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.440]   If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.360]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.280]   world hates you.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.800]   Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.'
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.520]   If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.120]   If they kept my word, they will also keep yours, but all these things they will do to
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.200]   you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.140]   If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.680]   But now they have no excuse for their sins.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   Whoever hates me hates my father also.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.180]   If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.180]   of sin.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.080]   But now they have seen and hated both me and my father.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.880]   But the word that is written in their law must be fulfilled.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   They hated me without a cause."
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.600]   So as Jesus sees the hatred that they have for him, in his mind it makes sense.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Why?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.740]   Because they hate my father.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.440]   And when you see the hatred that you experience from the world because of your faith, that
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   should make sense.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   Why?
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.640]   They hated my savior.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.120]   They hated my God, the Father.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.240]   They hated my Savior, the Christ.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.520]   Of course that's going to translate to me as well.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.360]   And so the command is just to expect it, but the command gets even more amplified because
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   he says, "Expect even the worst."
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.120]   So that's the blank for you in number two.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.080]   Expect even the worst.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.120]   I mean, part of me almost feels like, "Wow, that's a bold thing to say for Apostle Peter
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.080]   when he's in a generation where there are people being burned at the stake."
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   There are people who are being wrapped up in animal skin, thrown among the wolves, the
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   lions, and seen as sport, and there's all this stuff happening.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.160]   And he says, "Look at this ordeal, this fire of fearsome ordeal that's happening."
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.440]   And he says, "Even the worst case scenario that you can possibly think of, for us, completely
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.880]   unimaginable, right?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.440]   For us living very privileged in a culture that has specific rights, where even if someone
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   tries to prevent me from speaking, we can, you know, lash out and be like, 'I've got
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.080]   rights.'"
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.360]   Well, imagine in that time the kind of ordeal they were going through, and then Apostle
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.040]   Peter saying, "Even this, we should anticipate, even the worst of it all."
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.240]   And to me, I'm incredibly challenged by that.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.500]   Because again, when we think about why in our perspective a lot of this does not make
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.680]   sense, it's because to us, suffering is always supposed to be not normal.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.920]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.440]   Like whenever we experience suffering and setback, we think automatically, like, "This
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   isn't normal.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.280]   Like, this is not the way it should be."
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.920]   And that's when we start asking God, like, "Why, God?
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.560]   Why didn't I get into this?
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.160]   Or why didn't I receive this job?
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   Or why didn't this thing happen?"
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.560]   And all of a sudden, trying to interpret the setbacks of life becomes super difficult.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   Why?
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.160]   Because there is a fallen condition in us that just assumes any kind of hardship, any
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.600]   kind of suffering is not the normative, right?
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.640]   As a matter of fact, for us, we try our best, put forth all our effort to avoid that kind
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.020]   of suffering.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.200]   We find solutions and remedies for suffering as fast as we can.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.880]   Our perspective does not have suffering included in it as, "This is the way by which we're
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.080]   going to be saved.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.440]   This is the way by which we're going to be glorified into the future."
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.720]   It's a worldly thinking to expect of God.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.400]   You know, I remember counseling this individual who had an incredible amount of setback, and
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   they confessed.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.120]   They said, "I am bitter at God."
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   You know?
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.840]   And in this kind of scenario, I had to ask the question, like, "How did He disappoint
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.840]   you?"
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.560]   And it was one of these scenarios where they had a strong relationship that they thought
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.640]   were going to end up in this, they were on their way to it, and it just shattered and
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   broke apart.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640]   There was deep hurt.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   There was a lot of fighting, a lot of conflict.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.240]   And they said, "I don't know why God would do that to me."
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:56.280]   And I'm sitting there thinking, "Okay, your question is deeper than you think."
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.800]   Why?
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.400]   Because in your worldview, in your worldview, you placed in your worldview that God promised
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.480]   you you will have X, Y, and Z, including, let's say his name was John, John to be your
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.200]   husband.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.000]   Whatever it may be, whatever you were thinking in terms of God's promises to you, that was
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.520]   the promise you held onto.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   And then you decided, once that didn't happen, now I need to go to God to plead my case.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.960]   What happened, God?
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.700]   See that's the kind of fallen condition I'm talking about when we have a world perspective
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.040]   that God is supposed to have a normative life for me in this fashion.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.120]   But Apostle Peter's challenge to us is, let's change our perspective.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.320]   And let's anticipate, let's expect and not be surprised by even the worst case scenarios
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.240]   such as these.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.240]   Because this is what Christ said was actually normative for me.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.640]   When Christ said to his disciples, "Foxes have holes, birds have nests, the Son of Man
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.680]   doesn't even have a place to rest his head."
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.200]   What was he saying to his disciples?
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.980]   It could be you might not even have a home, right?
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.880]   When Christ was sharing with his disciples that this is the expectation you have for
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.400]   discipleship, is that the kind of expectation we held onto for our lives?
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.600]   Okay?
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.320]   So that's a great challenge that it's just for us in terms of the command to change our
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   perspective in that.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.480]   But what's more, the reason why we should anticipate and expect this is because we know
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.120]   God is testing you.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.480]   The passage says, "Beloved, do not be surprised at this fiery ordeal among you which comes
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   upon you for your testing."
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.640]   Now, I asked you guys for your homework, are there other passages that teach us that God
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.080]   tests us and puts us to the test?
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   Answer is yes.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:59.840]   Well, what are some of the passages that you found?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.040]   Are there other references in the Bible that teach us very clearly God tests you?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.760]   Job, the whole book.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.840]   Okay, good.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   Anything else?
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:24.400]   Gideon's men, okay.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Other passages?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   There are a lot of passages in the New Testament even that will describe the testing that we
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   go through, right?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.400]   That will describe this concept.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.600]   And to tell it truthfully, this should be something, let's say, if you hit a concept
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.800]   in the Bible that kind of strikes you as like, "Hmm, that's interesting."
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.440]   And then you could ask a lot of questions about that, right?
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.080]   How does he test?
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.600]   Does he test?
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.800]   And if he tests us, what kind of test is it?
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.780]   What's he even testing for?
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:03.220]   And how does the other passages of the Bible kind of fill in the details of that concept?
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.240]   Does God test us?
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.040]   Remember, even in the book of 1 Peter, when we started in chapter 1, the answer to that
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.400]   question is absolutely yes.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.920]   And he said that God tests us for the proof of our faith, and the proof of our faith,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.480]   when it shows to be genuine because of the testing, is even more precious than gold,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.560]   right?
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.980]   So clearly yes.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.600]   Other passages, for example, James chapter 1, verse 2 through 4.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.240]   James says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.840]   you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness."
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.200]   There's actually lots of verses.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.800]   Deuteronomy chapter 8, Old Testament, Isaiah 48, verse 10.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.040]   Let me read this one to you.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   "Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.600]   I have tested you in the furnace of affliction."
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   So clearly, God tests us with trial, hardship, and affliction.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.480]   So as we think about this, yeah, if this teaching comes to you as new and fresh, this is something
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   for you to study.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.480]   Wow.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.320]   So the next time you endure through some kind of difficulty, some kind of pressure from
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.400]   life, it's not to sit there and wonder like, "Oh my goodness, everybody else has it easy.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000]   Why me?"
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.600]   But now you have a way and means to interpret what's happening.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:36.800]   But I want to use this opportunity to get at a certain point.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.440]   My point number three, I kind of phrased purposely, God is testing you.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.360]   I was going to write, "Sometimes God tests you," like sometimes he puts you under affliction,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.680]   but actually God's always testing you, right?
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.560]   Because it's not just in hardship that you're tested, actually.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.620]   Your faith is being examined when you have affluence.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.480]   Sometimes God tests through delay.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.680]   It's not affliction, but he just delays the answer.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   Sometimes there's deprivation.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.240]   Yeah, he just takes away what you already had.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   So you just feel like, "Ugh, everything was going well.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.560]   It just got ripped away from my hand."
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.920]   Sometimes it's the abundance, right?
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   Everything's around you.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.660]   Everything's good, and there's a testing then too.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:27.960]   The fact of the matter is, every single opportunity that we have on earth, we are being tested
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.880]   for our faith, what's contained in our mind, what's contained in our heart.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.520]   And we have to realize that.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:40.140]   And one thing I've always said is, "And therefore, every decision that you make that's big in
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:46.040]   life is actually a spiritual decision.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.920]   It's a faith decision of how you go about making those things."
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.580]   And I just want to make that admonition that for us, we are being tested.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.540]   It's just that for us, sometimes, again, we're coming back to this idea of expectation.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:03.980]   It just shocks us because we didn't think we'd be tested by pain, right?
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.940]   It shocks us because we didn't think we'd be tested by affliction.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.520]   But the scriptures teaches us there's all sorts of testing, right?
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.860]   Including those that really hurt, those that cause us a lot of grief and worry.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:25.140]   And so, clearly, just to kind of summarize that point, God uses the different experiences
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:31.500]   in your life, including suffering, very purposefully and intentionally.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.920]   God uses all things in your life, scripture says.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.480]   Even the things that seem mundane, even the things that seem out of place, even the things
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.760]   that in our perspectives seems abnormal.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.760]   And look at this.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.460]   Please turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 12, verse 7 through 11.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.020]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 7 through 11.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:58.580]   This is that passage where God is talking about His discipline as a father of His children.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.580]   And He says this.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.940]   Again, chapter 12, verse 7 through 11.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.540]   It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.860]   God is treating you as sons.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.900]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.600]   If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.860]   children and not sons.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:26.540]   Besides this, we've had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.300]   Shall we not much more be subject to the father of spirits and live?
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.060]   For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplined
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.060]   us for our good, that we may share his holiness.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.400]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.300]   the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.940]   Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees and make straight paths for
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:59.260]   your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.580]   So I take this moment just to encourage.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.220]   I presume there are many people in here who have suffered.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:13.960]   I presume there are perhaps many people in this room who are already suffering.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:23.400]   What makes suffering super difficult is, I repeat, when you feel like it's pointless.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.560]   When you feel like there's no reason.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.800]   Then trying to make sense of it all becomes all the more frustrating.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.560]   You realize that in the hands of God, it is being used in multiple ways.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.240]   God is using it for training.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.560]   God is using it for purging.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.000]   God is using it for examination.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.600]   God is using it to treat you as a son, as a child, as a daughter.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   And so we remember that God does not work in kind of this haphazard, wishy-washy, whatever
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.760]   comes, whatever may be, so let it be kind of way.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.880]   But rather he is absolutely in control.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.280]   And so again, Apostle Peter's challenge to us is, keep this in your perspective.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.560]   That you're not all of a sudden taking a back thinking, "What is this?"
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   Right?
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.800]   But the challenge is expect it.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.720]   Expect it.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   Okay?
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:21.080]   Next, rather than then being frustrated by a lack of understanding, rather than being
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.440]   caught off guard and then asking, "Why in the world is God doing this?"
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.680]   He says, rather, verse 13, "But to the degree that you share in the sufferings of Christ,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:38.360]   keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice with exaltation.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.600]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.240]   and of God rests upon you."
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   Okay?
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:53.920]   So here I have another section, verse 13 through 14, as he makes a contrast, right?
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.480]   Contrast to being shocked and taken off guard.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.400]   He says, rather, rejoice.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.520]   Rejoice.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:06.240]   So the point learned from verse 12 through 14 here, okay, is simply that.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.200]   Apostle Peter wants to change your perspective so that you can go from frustration from not
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   understanding and not expecting, to rejoicing.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:20.320]   To having an expectation where you're going to exalt with Christ when he comes.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.120]   So remember, we've talked about this before, to rejoice in our suffering and stuff, right?
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.800]   And think for a moment now, that question.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.400]   How does that look if we're supposed to rejoice in suffering?
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.540]   How do we do that?
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:42.960]   And if it sounds in your head right now, like, that sounds so wrong, you know?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.440]   There are those people who are, I think they call them sadomasochists, where they just
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.920]   enjoy pain for the sake of pain.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.040]   They just want to hurt themselves, you know?
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   They're people like that.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.760]   I saw this crazy video that now there are these people who've been watching all this
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.640]   crazy stuff, so they're actually paying men to torture them.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.600]   So to experience it.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.840]   Like, they're paying people to get a van, grab them, take them to the woods, and beat
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   them.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.200]   It's just crazy and mind-boggling.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.840]   And the police are wondering, like, what should we do about this?
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.640]   It's a big issue.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.440]   Part of me is shocked that this world is doing that.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.160]   The other part of me is not, you know?
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.280]   But is it that kind of twistedness where you're just like, "Ah, yay, pain!"
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.000]   No, of course not.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Absolutely not.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.480]   But rather, there are reasons that Apostle Peter gives.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.200]   Reasons for rejoicing.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.800]   The first reason.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:45.040]   You rejoice because, it's there in the passage, you're sharing in Christ's suffering.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   You're not just randomly suffering.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.880]   You're sharing in the sufferings of Christ.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.980]   And so here and now, we are talking about not just every and any kind of suffering that
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.880]   life has to offer, but here and now we are talking about the kind of suffering these
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.800]   people that Apostle Peter's addressing who are suffering because of the name of Christ.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.200]   Suffering because they proclaim his gospel and because they claim his name.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.320]   He is my Savior.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.520]   He is my King.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.280]   My allegiance is with Him.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.160]   And for that reason, they're being tortured.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   Right?
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.960]   And Apostle Peter says, "You rejoice because you share with Him in that."
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   You share with Him.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.200]   I'll give you an example of this.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.000]   This past week, in the afternoon on Sunday, I forget what day it was, but I got a chance
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   to drive down to San Diego.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.080]   I got a chance to meet up with one of the Lighthouse pastors and we're all talking and
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.400]   I said, "Hey, I gotta tell you, man."
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.440]   I call it the week of the build, right?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.880]   We're talking about that week that we spent here that we're calling like, "Hey, it felt
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   like war," and all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.360]   So I was telling him, I was like, "It was crazy.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.360]   We thought we were in.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.560]   We cleaned the church and everything, like cleaned the floor and then it happened."
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   And he's like, "What?"
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.160]   And I'm like, "The structural engineer came in."
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.360]   And then I didn't know how to tell the story.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.400]   So I was like, "And then after the structural engineer came in, we were like distraught
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.000]   and then we pulled in beams and there was like this 24-foot beam that we were all carrying."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And he looked at me like, "Mm-hmm."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.160]   I was like, "Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   You're carrying beams, man."
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   And he's like, "Oh, sure."
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   And I was like, "No, serious.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.800]   It took like four of us, like eight of us to carry the big ones and then I got cut right
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.880]   here but it's gone so I don't have anything to show for it anymore."
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.360]   And he was like, "Yeah, okay, okay."
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.920]   And I could tell he was getting bored by my story and it totally deflated me.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.040]   I was like, "Oh, my story is lame."
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.400]   And I'm trying to share with him and it was crazy because the guys, we stayed up till
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.000]   forever and he was like, "Okay, dang.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   It must have been crazy."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.440]   I was like, "You don't get it, man.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   Forget you."
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.040]   So I stopped telling him the story.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.200]   And then I was telling my sister-in-law or whatever.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.080]   I was like, "Dude," and then we had like 15 guys at the church and she looked at me and
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.360]   was like, "Why didn't you guys just hire contractors?"
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:04.520]   I was like, "I'm not going to answer your question."
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.280]   Well the reason why I share with that is because when you're trying to tell a crazy story to
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.320]   someone who hasn't shared the experience with you, isn't it so hard?
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.080]   But then when we get together with the church people and we're like, "Dude, remember how
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.080]   crazy it was?
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.520]   Remember when Kevin got hit in the face with a hammer?"
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   And I was like, "Oh, yeah!
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.000]   Chris was like throwing the hammer and then he got hit in the face."
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.520]   And we're just like, "Ha, ha, ha, ha."
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.720]   And everyone's laughing because we knew what happened with the hammer to his face, you
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   know?
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.640]   But you can just like, what?
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   You can have a sense of automatic fellowship with that.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.920]   There's a sense of automatic joy with that.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.640]   But there's also a sharing of the glory, of the joy in participating with all the experiences.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.060]   And that's how men feel when they go to battle and they come back.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.460]   That's how people feel when they have a crisis experience and all of a sudden they feel close.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.960]   We rejoice because there is a fellowship.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.560]   Sorry, Kevin, to bring up here.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.640]   We rejoice because of the experience.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.080]   The hatred that hit Christ is hitting us.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.080]   We're in good company.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.840]   We're in the company of Christ, right?
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   That's the joy in fellowship with experience and sympathy with what Christ has experienced.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.240]   So we have that joy.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.760]   But what's more, we rejoice because we're blessed.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:33.120]   Apostle Peter, again, here is this great big perspective change, right?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.600]   So he wants you to define the persecution you experience, including the confiscation
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.120]   of your property, the ripping apart of your family, getting chased out of your home, getting
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.840]   burned alive and people dying.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.760]   And the fear that you have that at every turn and every corner, you're going to be hunted.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.560]   He says, I want you to count that as being blessed.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:03.320]   Man, you must do an entire worldview shift in order to do that.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.760]   But that's what he says.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.600]   That's what Jesus said.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.840]   Remember in Matthew chapter five, he said, "Blessed are those who are persecuted because
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.640]   of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.800]   Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.720]   you because of me.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.760]   persecuted the prophets who were before you."
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.280]   So there's a sense in which in the Beatitudes when Jesus is saying, "Blessed are those who
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.680]   hunger and thirst for righteousness," we're like, "Yes!"
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.400]   But does this also ring true?
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.280]   Do we memorize this the same?
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.320]   That you're supposed to have a worldview that completely is shifted from how the natural
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.600]   man thinks so that you would now define the persecution that you're receiving as being
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.280]   truly blessed.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.080]   That's really hard to do.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.520]   We feel typically blessed when we have all our needs met.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.100]   We feel typically blessed when we have the next stage in life move smoothly and all the
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:13.000]   transitions are going well and all the expectations that we had are filled.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.640]   But here he says, "No, you are blessed when you're persecuted, insulted, when all kinds
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.080]   of evil is done to you because of the name of Christ."
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.960]   Well, let's give some rationale to that.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:31.640]   Number one, you're counted blessed because of future grace.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.480]   You're counted blessed because of future grace.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.140]   This passage talks about how at the revelation of His glory, then you're going to rejoice
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.140]   with exaltation.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.040]   So, we're looking forward to the glory that is wrapped in Christ and His coming.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.000]   There's a passage in Romans chapter 8, I'm going to read this for us.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.320]   Verse 14 through 17 says, "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.160]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.960]   the spirit of adoptions as sons by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.760]   Listen to this, "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit we are children of
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:13.480]   God and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ provided
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.360]   we suffer with Him in order that we may also be glorified with Him."
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.200]   He says you are children provided that you go through this necessary process as legitimate
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.920]   children.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   What is this?
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.280]   That you suffer with Him and then you will be glorified with Him.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.360]   Future grace, you're blessed.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.880]   What's more, number two, you're blessed because you're being used.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.320]   You're blessed because you're being used.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.480]   I want you to take a moment to think about that a little bit.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.280]   Blessed because I'm being used?
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.040]   What do I mean by that?
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.280]   There is a joy of being used by the Lord.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.320]   You know, every single individual who has a skill, who has a purpose, who has a talent,
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.920]   for example, a basketball player.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.400]   You know any basketball players who loves being on the bench?
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.560]   Like true athletes who love doing nothing?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.840]   I just always wanted to be water boy.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.560]   You don't ever meet anybody who thinks like that.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   How do they think?
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   I want minutes.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.000]   I want playing time.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.400]   I want to be option number one.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.040]   So even if they had to run the full length of the court 48 minutes the entire game and
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.600]   then some, it feels good even if they're exhausted.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   Why?
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.520]   Because they were used.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   And it's to their what?
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   To their glory.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.640]   It's to their benefits.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.160]   To their, it's even satisfying to them that I got used.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.880]   Well the fact of the matter is for every Christian, every servant of God, to be used by the master
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.800]   feels good.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.720]   I remember when I was a Christian, when I first became Christian and I was young in
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.920]   high school, I thanked my pastor because the very first Christian song I learned is a simple
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.400]   song that simply stated, "Use me dear Lord, use me.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.600]   To be a light in the darkest night, use me dear Lord."
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.200]   It had three chords because that's all I knew and that's the one song I sang for like a
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   whole year.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.440]   And I'm going to tell you honestly, I felt like that implanted in me like I'm happy when
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.000]   I can be used by the Lord.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.600]   Like I really am.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.200]   That's why, you know, sometimes people wonder why did you want a van?
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.560]   I wanted a minivan because when I took the youth group out and I was like, you know,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.360]   driving them around, it felt good.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.520]   It just felt good to drive people around, you know, get people where they needed to
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.520]   go.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.720]   I love driving and all that kind of stuff, but I wanted to be used.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.760]   Well the fact of the matter is that's the kind of example that the scripture says too.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.560]   There's a passage in Acts chapter 5 verse 31 when the disciples are persecuted.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.680]   Apostle Peter and the disciples are told by the Sanhedrin and the leaders, "Don't you
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.240]   dare preach the name of Christ."
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   They beat them.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.160]   And this is what it says, "When I called them, they beat them, charged them not to speak
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.360]   in the name of Jesus and let them go.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.120]   Then they left the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.880]   suffer this honor for the name.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.040]   And every day in the temple and from the house to house they did not cease teaching and preaching
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.000]   that the Christ is Jesus."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.760]   If we really thought of ourselves like true athletes in the game, like true servants in
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:41.600]   the house, it would be our reward and blessing to be used by the master.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.680]   It's when our perspective thinks, "I'm the master of the house though."
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.520]   It's when our perspective is, "But I'm the coach."
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.220]   It's when our perspective is skewed and twisted and perverse when we all of a sudden don't
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.520]   see the work as rewarding anymore.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.440]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.160]   And if you remember in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, please turn your Bibles there.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.120]   This is a longer passage, but I just wanted to read it in whole because it had lots of
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.200]   the same themes that we're studying here in 1 Peter.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.740]   So 2 Corinthians chapter 5, starting from verse 5.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.480]   Apostle Paul here in 2 Corinthians says this.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.200]   I'm going to read a lengthy passage here.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.440]   It says, "For we know that if the tent, that is our earthly home, is destroyed, we have
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.560]   a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.320]   For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, if indeed by putting
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.960]   it on we may not be found naked.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.880]   For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened, not that we would be unclothed,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.520]   but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.560]   He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us a spirit as a guarantee.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.780]   So we are always of good courage.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.520]   We know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord, for we walk in
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.040]   faith, not by sight.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.440]   Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.440]   the Lord.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:15.480]   So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim, our ambition, to please Him.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.760]   For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.720]   what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil."
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.040]   What am I talking about here?
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:35.080]   In connection with this idea of wanting to be used and being blessed when we are used,
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:41.280]   there is this idea of if it is our ambition to be pleasing to our Master, He says, "And
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.520]   then later on you are going to be examined for that.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.040]   We are going to receive reward for that."
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.800]   The doctrine of the Christian reward, the heavenly reward, is that in our works, in
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.000]   our striving, in our labor, it is not for nothing.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.120]   But rather we are going to actually give an account for the things, and God and Christ
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.600]   on that bama seat, judgment seat of Christ, is going to actually reward you for the things
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.680]   that you do.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.940]   And so we make it then our ambition to be used by the Lord, and it is to our blessing
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.000]   that we be used much.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.400]   Number three, we are blessed because of God's favor and presence.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:27.400]   We are blessed because of God's favor and presence.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:36.560]   So here we are not talking about a blessing where like, "Hey, if you go through suffering,
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.360]   then you are going to have battle scars to show for it."
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.240]   Or yes, is suffering going to produce in you greater perseverance?
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.360]   Is suffering going to produce in you maybe a greater confidence, "Hey, I went through
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.880]   that, I can go through more."
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   Could be.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.360]   And as a matter of fact, other passages do teach us that suffering produces a level of
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:03.240]   endurance where without the suffering, without the hardship, maybe you would have never experienced.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.120]   However, in this passage, He is not emphasizing that.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.720]   He is not emphasizing, "Hey, you're blessed because there's self-improvement.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.640]   There's a leveling up of who you are."
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.240]   Rather, here and now, He's talking about, "You are blessed because you experience a
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.280]   kind of grace and presence of God like none other.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.380]   You experience subjectively," and this is very important, okay?
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.680]   We can experience some things to a certain degree, okay?
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.320]   We can feel the warmth of God because you're sitting here and then pastor preaches to you,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.280]   "God is so loving," and He sees you precious and then you're just like, "Yeah, that feels
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   good."
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.600]   But there is a kind of subjective, "I experience the comforting words of God when I need it
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.800]   most, when I'm most desperate, He finds me," kind of subjective experience with God that
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.760]   you need to know, that you need to know on a deeper level.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.200]   And then, Apostle Peter is saying, "That knowledge and depth of God's presence, when
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.720]   you experience it in the midst of your suffering, you are blessed."
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:15.880]   Do you remember Apostle Paul saying, there's a passage in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, where
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:22.160]   he says, "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   in weakness.'"
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.440]   And so, Apostle Paul says, "Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.160]   so that the power of Christ may rest upon me for the sake of Christ when I am content
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:39.320]   with weakness, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities, for when I am weak, then I
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.920]   am strong."
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:48.520]   That statement, "When I am weak, then I am strong," I believe Apostle Paul says experientially,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.840]   personal subjective experience.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.400]   Why?
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.160]   Apostle Paul had to plead with God three times, maybe even more, "God, can you please take
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   this away?
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.200]   God, can you please take this away?
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.400]   Can you please take this away?"
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:10.880]   And through that hardship and pain, God taught him, "But my strength is perfected even when
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.280]   you are weak, maybe especially when you are weak."
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.960]   That's not something he heard because he saw it on the wall and was like, "Oh yeah, I remember
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   that line.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   God's strength is perfected when I'm weak."
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.440]   And so, he just cited it.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.960]   I believe he experienced the comforts of God and that's why the whole book of 2 Corinthians,
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.320]   Apostle Paul can lavishly pour out the comforts of God.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   Why?
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:40.600]   Because he says in chapter 1, "I can comfort you because I receive the comfort of the Father."
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.560]   That's pretty amazing stuff.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   So he's saying you are blessed because of this presence of God that you experience when
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.840]   you endure suffering.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:57.520]   So this kind of perspective, we obviously don't learn overnight.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:04.080]   We have to commit ourselves to spiritually interpret the world this way.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.880]   And can I challenge you?
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:14.420]   There are sometimes loyalties we have to this world where in our thinking, we have trusted
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.240]   and given our confidence to the principles of this world.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   I'm going back to the idea of when we expect that when I try hard, we're going to receive
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.640]   these results.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.700]   When I'm kind and nice to people, I will have friends.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.720]   When I show my love and make vulnerable, then I will have that reciprocated to me.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.320]   When I X, Y, and Z and all this kind of stuff, the promises of the world, the normal functions
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:43.760]   that everybody operates by, do not give your allegiance to that stuff.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.200]   Right?
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.240]   But John did this and but, but, but, you know?
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.360]   We always have this kind of like subtle allegiances to the way the world thinks.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.300]   You have to have a commitment.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.440]   I will interpret.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:05.360]   I will begin interpreting my life, this world, my God, all my experiences, and the people
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.120]   around me through this lens.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:15.560]   I'm actually blessed when I'm proclaiming the name of Christ, I'm in His will, and I'm
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   suffering.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.560]   And I'm going through hardship.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.120]   I am blessed.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   Right?
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   That takes a profound amount of effort, spiritual faith for us to interpret the world that way.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   Okay?
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.080]   So the challenge to us is keep on rejoicing, keep on rejoicing, and have this perspective.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   You are blessed.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   Amen?
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.160]   Any questions about that so far before we jump into the last section?
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.680]   Any questions?
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   Okay.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.840]   All right.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.840]   Next section.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.520]   Verse 15 through 16.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.080]   Apostle Peter says, "Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or thief or evildoer
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.960]   or a troublesome meddler.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:00.080]   But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   this name."
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   Okay?
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.000]   And I'm just going to make a couple statements here about this.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   The passage is clear.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.160]   Not all suffering is the same.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.600]   Let's be discerning here.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   Right?
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.480]   Let's be discerning about our life experiences.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.440]   Not all suffering is one and the same.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.680]   Sometimes we suffer just because of our silly mistakes.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.600]   Sometimes we suffer because of our own sins.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.480]   And his challenge to us simply is do not suffer in a way that you shame God.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.260]   Right?
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.920]   Don't suffer in ways that you just shame yourself and God.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   Okay?
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.120]   But that part's clear.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.020]   But I just want to bring back this idea too.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.040]   Don't be surprised when you suffer for foolish things.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.960]   Don't be surprised when you suffer for foolish things.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.880]   And I'm just making an admonition here.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.760]   You know what's worse than doing dumb things?
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.760]   Being surprised about it.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.320]   Right?
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.560]   When all of a sudden you're like, "Oh, I didn't know that was going to happen."
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   You know?
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.400]   Like, for example, sometimes guys say really silly things.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.520]   Sometimes as they're saying silly things, they hurt people.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.120]   And so they say and do whatever they want.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.160]   They think it's funny and they start making fun of people.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   And some girl's all mad and they're like, "What'd you say?
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   No, no, no, no."
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.640]   And then all of a sudden the guy goes, "What?
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   You mad?"
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.920]   You know?
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:22.120]   You look extra dumb when you do dumb things and then you suffer the consequences of your
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.400]   dumb things and you're all surprised by it.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.440]   Right?
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.200]   But the reason why I bring that up is because we tend to do that sometimes.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.720]   You know?
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.480]   We tend to strive after worldly things and then when we get jaded by it, when we're disappointed
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.840]   by it, we're like, "What gives?"
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.200]   You know?
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.120]   Sometimes we actually sin by way of greed, by way of lust, by way of wanting things we
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.620]   shouldn't have been wanting.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.040]   And when it backfires on us, all of a sudden we're all shocked.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.040]   "Why is this happening to me?"
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   Right?
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:01.600]   And then it convicts us because, yeah, what in the world were we thinking?
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.440]   But what's more, earlier we talked about not being shocked.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   You know?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   Let's not do that.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.440]   You know?
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.360]   Let's not be shocked by what we do not to do.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.800]   That would be even worse.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Okay?
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   Verse 17.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   It says, "For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.160]   And if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.840]   gospel of God?
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.880]   And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.200]   man and the sinner?"
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.320]   All right?
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.360]   And for homework, I ask you this question.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.240]   Verse 17 and 18, excuse me.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:43.880]   Verse 17 and 18, Apostle Peter uses a means of asking questions to make a point.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.760]   My question, what's that point?
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.400]   And for this one, yes, audience participation, please.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.240]   What is the point that Apostle Peter is making via his questions?
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.040]   Anyone want to take a shot?
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.040]   I know it's tough.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.040]   It's a big group.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:05.760]   If you raise your hand and you say something silly, everyone might laugh.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.080]   Just take a shot, you know.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   We're just trying to make observations and then trying to, you know, kind of take an
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.280]   insight into how Apostle Peter is making a point here.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.800]   And it's not just one specific point he's making.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.680]   He's making a couple.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.760]   So just let's take a shot and think about it.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.720]   And don't make me call on you, okay?
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.560]   So what point do you think Apostle Peter is making via his two questions?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   Okay.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.560]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   Excellent.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   Okay.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:53.640]   So he said, have this godly sense of reverence and fear, and then you should be appreciating
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.240]   the salvation that you have.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   Okay.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.000]   So as you take a look at that, definitely when he says it's time for judgment to begin
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.440]   with the household of God, there is an aspect of, yes, you should be anticipating with reverent
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.400]   fear, God is going to purge the house.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.960]   Is he not?
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.040]   God is going to examine the house.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:23.200]   And we should be with a reverent fear than going through that examination with a healthy
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.960]   fear of God.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   And what's more?
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   There's a passage in 1 Corinthians 11, verse 32 that specifically spells that out.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.960]   Okay?
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.080]   It just spells that out.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:40.480]   He says this, "Let a person examine himself, and so eat of the bread and the drink of the
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   cup.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.960]   For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.120]   That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.400]   But if we judge ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.920]   But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.400]   along with the world."
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.760]   Okay?
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:05.040]   So there's this element here of this exhortation to you.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.080]   You know, even in this time of suffering, you should still have this reverent fear of
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   God because God is going to judge us, and it says he's going to judge the house first.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.480]   And this judgment is not a condemnation.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.920]   And so just like Dean was saying, we shouldn't fear like, "Oh my gosh, we're going to be
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.080]   condemned like the rest."
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.080]   Rather he says, "You're not, you know, you need to judge yourself and examine yourself
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.800]   so that you're not condemned with the rest."
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   Right?
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.120]   And rather you have this appreciation for the salvation you have in which God has afforded
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.680]   for you.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:45.240]   But I think there's even a point to this that he's making when he contrasts between the
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.720]   people of the house and in others.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   Right?
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.480]   So by way of asking the question, he is highlighting a contrast here, is he not?
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:58.680]   He's saying, "If it begins with us, the question is, what about them?"
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.920]   Right?
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.920]   So what do you think is the point of those two questions?
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.440]   The first question he's asking, and then verse 18, he uses a quote from the Old Testament
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.920]   to ask the same thing.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   [inaudible]
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   Excellent.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.400]   Okay?
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.320]   That is the central point here.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.400]   Basically, if you want to summarize it in kind of just real frank terms, this is so
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.600]   much better than hell.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.400]   Right?
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.840]   Like the people are suffering and perhaps they're just thinking like, "We can't do
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   this."
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840]   You know?
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:50.480]   And there is this incredibly frank and candid and just direct statement through this question.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.320]   Think about this, okay?
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.280]   What you are going through, you are going through a judgment.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.360]   Yes, you're going through a discipline.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.880]   But think what will be of those who disobey.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.200]   Meaning, think what will be of those who reject.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.840]   Think what will be of those who fail this test.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.540]   What would it mean for these individuals to fail the test?
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.360]   They start saying, "Yes, we're Christian."
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   And then they get persecuted.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   "No, we're not.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.480]   No, we're not."
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.100]   For them to fail the test would be to deny the name of Christ.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.520]   For them to fail the test would be to say, "I'm not a Christian."
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.280]   Because all they would have to do is to say, "I'm one of you guys.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.360]   I'm not an enemy to you.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.520]   I'm not weird like them."
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.920]   And that's all they would have to say.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.000]   It would be like the Jewish people where Jesus said, "And many of them believe but were not
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.480]   willing to profess His name because of the fear of the Pharisees."
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.360]   That's what they would have to do to protect themselves.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:44.440]   And if they did, Apostle Peter is both giving an encouragement and a warning.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.120]   What you're experiencing is so much better than what awaits those who reject the name
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.940]   of Christ.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.720]   What you're experiencing, yes, it's so difficult and painful.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.320]   But think about the other option.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.820]   If you're even tempted with, "That might be a way of escape," think about those who would
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.740]   deny the name of Christ.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:12.120]   If Christians have to go through this, if Christians, the household of God is going
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.840]   to be judged first, it's going to be so much worse.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:20.680]   So much worse for those who would deny the name of the Lord.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.480]   And so he says, "Therefore, those who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:31.120]   their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right."
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.960]   In giving them that admonition, think about the two options here.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:41.120]   He says, "So you entrust your soul to God."
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.080]   Entrust your soul to God.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.920]   The word there for entrust, it's a very vivid term because he uses a banking term, like
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:56.720]   the bank, an institution that holds your money, as a way of which you are putting your money
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.560]   away in a security box.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.320]   You know how banks have those safe deposit boxes where it's locked up in a vault and
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.800]   you see those movies where people have to go in with a guy from the bank, the banker
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.200]   guy, and you have to go in with two keys and open it up.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:16.880]   He's saying essentially in that vivid form, "Entrust your soul to God."
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.800]   And I want to read an interesting passage that joins together the previous section,
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.160]   verse 17 and 18.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.680]   Think about those, those individuals who are persecuting you or those who are denying the
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.800]   name of Christ and this idea with trusting yourself over to God.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.280]   By going in your Bibles to 2 Thessalonians 1, verse 5 through 9.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   Okay?
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.340]   2 Thessalonians 1, verse 5 through 9.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:48.240]   And in this passage, the people that Apostle Paul is talking to is also suffering, but
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.660]   he encourages them who are suffering with these words.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.280]   This is what Apostle Paul says.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.200]   He says, "Therefore, we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   in faith in all your persecutions and all your afflictions that you are enduring.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.480]   This is evident of the righteous judgment of God that you may be considered worthy of
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.200]   the kingdom of God for which you are also suffering."
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.480]   So same themes, right?
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.320]   Worthy of the kingdom of God, you're experiencing these persecutions and you're enduring, right?
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.200]   He says, "Since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   you and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.960]   When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:37.840]   vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.920]   Lord Jesus, they will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.360]   of the Lord and from the glory of his might."
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.400]   So from that passage, I want to challenge you.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.240]   You too need to trust God.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.960]   You need to trust God that he will take care of you, first blank, God will take care of
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.280]   you, but also God will take care of them.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.000]   When Apostle Peter in that passage is asking the question, "Well, you've gone through this
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.960]   and you're going to go through judgment, but what do you think is going to happen to them?
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.480]   The people who do not obey the gospel, the enemies of Christ, those who reject and deny
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.520]   the name of the Savior, what do you think is going to happen to them?"
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.120]   He's not, you're not just supposed to be like, "Well, I don't know.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   What is going to happen to them?"
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.920]   You're supposed to think God's going to take care of them, right?
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   Who's going to have vengeance?
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   Who's going to make it right?
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.000]   Who's going to enact justice?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.760]   It's going to be God.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.640]   You see, for us, we're so calculating.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.760]   We're so fast to calculate.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.160]   It just happens intuitively, right?
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.720]   There have been so many times when I've counseled certain people, whether it's counseling people
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.400]   to, you know, as a mediator between two people in conflict, and I'll say, "Man, I think you
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.000]   really have to forgive them."
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   And they'll say, "Oh, I can't."
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   "Why can't you?"
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   "Because they're going to do it again."
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   Right?
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.880]   Someone might say, "Oh, you know, you need to reconcile with that person and you need
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.560]   to say certain things to them."
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   It's like, "Why?
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   I can't."
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   "Why can't you?"
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.880]   "Because they're going to get away with it."
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.040]   The question is, are they though?
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.840]   Are they really going to get away with it?
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.560]   These are the moments you actually start practicing your trust in God, right?
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.280]   Your spiritual trust.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.320]   I feel like I can't because in my intuition, when I do this, the end result is going to
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.640]   be they're going to get away.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.800]   They're going to have the upper hand.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.360]   They're going to keep doing it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   And I'm going to always lose.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   I'm going to always suffer.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   Da-da-da-da-da.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:48.200]   Because you're always calculating the action and the end result.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:53.080]   Here and now, the challenge is you need to trust God with all the results.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.960]   Should God call you to patient endurance, then you do it trusting the results.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.880]   Should God call you to keep speaking with boldness the gospel of Christ, you do it entrusting
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.400]   Him with the results.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.760]   Because God is encouraging you through Apostle Peter that you're supposed to not only entrust
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:15.320]   God with the results, you're supposed to trust God with your soul, right?
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:22.860]   How are we going to entrust, bank, literally bank our soul in God when we can't even entrust
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.640]   God with what that guy's going to do?
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.200]   We can't trust God with the results of how I'm going to look when I say this.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.040]   But Apostle Peter is challenging us.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.360]   Trust to God your entire soul, everything about you.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.360]   Amen?
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.040]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.240]   Father Lord, we want to thank you again for your grace.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.320]   You remind us, Lord, that you are absolutely sovereign even when there seems to be a storm
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.920]   about us.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:01.160]   Even when we are at our wits end, when we can't make sense of things, we realize, Father
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.280]   God, that you are absolutely in control.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:10.440]   Help us fight by faith to both remember and to consider these things, Lord, so that, Father,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.920]   we would experience the kind of peace and comfort that Apostle Peter is talking about,
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.680]   the kind of blessedness that Apostle Peter describes.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.440]   And Lord, I again pray that if anybody in this room is suffering, is going through hardship,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.000]   would you encourage them by reminding them, Lord, that by your sovereign hand that you
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.880]   will guide them, guard them, and Lord, you will use it all to your glory.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:39.760]   And Father, every experience that we have, we can redeem for your praise and for your
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   honor.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.880]   Lord, we want to thank you again, Saint Christ, and we pray.
