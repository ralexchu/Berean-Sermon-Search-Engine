[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   >> All right, welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But first of all, as you guys know, our Passion Week is coming next Sunday.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Pastor Peter Chong is going to lead us through the triumphal entry of Jesus,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Palm Sunday, and it's gonna kick off our Passion Week.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And so I kind of made a mistake, the gospel night track, and
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I'll explain that in a little bit.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   But the Easter flyer, you should have gotten it when you were coming in.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So on the back of that, it gives you the schedule of what's happening that week.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And so each Easter week, we wanna maximize the opportunity that we have.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And so starting off on next Sunday with the Palm Sunday, and
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   then each night, Monday through Wednesday, we have a devotional here at 730.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And there's gonna be various testimonies and devotions given.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And so devotion is gonna be focused on what's happening each day.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   So Monday, Jesus comes to Jerusalem, and then Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And then on Thursday night, we have a Passover meal that we celebrate together.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And so if you haven't attended that, and even if you have, and
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   you want to celebrate that together,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   if you really understand what's going on in the Passion meal, the elements.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And how God has embedded that into the Jerusalem, Israel's culture.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And how for hundreds of years,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   that each time they did this was pointing to the coming of Christ.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And so when Jesus is breaking bread and drinking of the covenant wine together.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And then he says to do this in remembrance of me,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   which transitioned into the communion that we have today.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   To really be able to understand that physically,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   not just reading it, but to participate in it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   It really kind of highlights the gospel and what Christ was doing into their culture.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So if you haven't done that, we highly recommend, even if you're not a family,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   there is a cap to the number because of the size of the room.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   So try to sign up as soon as you can.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And so that's happening.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And then Friday night, we have the Friday night as we remember his death and suffering.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   We do have a guest speaker that's coming, Sung Kang.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   He's going to be coming and he's going to be delivering the word and giving his testimony.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And so I highly encourage you to put that on your schedule.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And he's going to be encouraging us with the word.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And then Sunday morning, we have the resurrection early rise service we will have outside.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And then that day we have Easter celebration and lunch will be provided.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And it just happens to be our 25th anniversary of the church.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   So we will also have lunch and various things provided for that purpose.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   So please take this and again take advantage of the fact that there are a lot of people who are seeking
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   and looking for answers of what's happening around us.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   So use this as an opportunity to share the gospel with people.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   At the minimum, keep it in your Bible and pray that this week would cause us to think deeply about
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   So we have this flyer or this card, I don't know what you call it.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And then we have this gospel night.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   So I misspoke last time.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   The gospel night flyers are welcome to our outreach team is heading up a gospel night that's coming up soon.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so this is to kind of pass out to your friends and invite them to that and to hear the gospel.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And they kind of left it blank so that when you do give and invite people,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   so that you can put personal information and invitation on that.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   So you can repeatedly use it.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So this is something that you can take, keep it in your Bible,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and just give it to people as you feel the need to do that.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   So that will be available as well.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Along with that, we have various evangelism outings going on.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   So as you're coming in, you probably saw a table out there for EV.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So if you want to sign up for that and then go out and do street evangelism together with them, please do so.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And then we also have VBS volunteers that are still needed.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   So as you're going into the cafe, you probably saw a table that's set up there.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And so if you are planning to help in any way, even if it's just cooking food or,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   "Hey, I can clean up and maybe I'm not really good with kids.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They get scared when I'm around, but I'm good with cooking."
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   So you can go there and just sign up and they'll give you assignments to do whatever you need.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   So as you're going out, make sure you visit that table.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And then one last thing, our Women's Ministry has a tea time,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   is a fellowship among the sisters that's happening on April 30th, 9.30 a.m. in this room till noon.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And so if you haven't signed up for that, please sign up for that as well.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   So let me take a minute to pray for us for our offering.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And again, those who are going to give electronically, to give either through Zelle or PayPal.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And if you only have Venmo, you can also use Venmo, but we want to encourage you to use the other avenues.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And then after that, our sister Diane Lee is going to come give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Heavenly Father, we've gathered together corporately to worship you, to honor you,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   to hear your word, to celebrate your goodness in our lives.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Lord, if we've been distracted with whatever it is, Lord God, in our life,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   help us to recalibrate our thoughts and our hearts,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   that we may be molded to the image that you desire of us.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I pray, Father God, as we prepare our hearts and our mind for the big celebration, Lord, of Christ's suffering,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and why we are here, why we're gathered together, the purpose of this church,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and the eternal hope that we have in Christ.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I pray that every part of what we do would cause us to be revived and renewed.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Even this offering, I pray that you would help us to give it to you in spirit and in truth,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   may it be multiplied for your name, for your glory.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I just want to encourage you and challenge you as we come week to week.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Oftentimes it might be a routine, but as we sing this first song, "Hosanna," praise is rising.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   It's a call to worship that as we sing these songs that we're mindful of what we sing, obviously.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And those of you who are able, clap along with us, please.

[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   In your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   You are the God who saves us.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Worthy of all our praises.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Hear the sound.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Hear the sound of hearts returning to you.

[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   In your kingdom, broken like dominoes.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   You make us, you make us new.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Because when, because when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   In your presence, in your presence, all our fears are washed away, washed away.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   You are the God who saves us.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Worthy of all our praises.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.

[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   One more time, because when, because when we see you, we find strength to face the day.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Lord.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   In your presence, all our fears are washed away, washed away.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You are the God who saves us.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Worthy of all our praises.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.

[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   How high the mountain I could not climb.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   In desperation, I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   The work is finished, the end is written.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   [Music]
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   The God of ages stepped down from heaven to bear my sin and bear my shame.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   The cross, the cross has spoken.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I am forgiven.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   The King of kings calls me his own.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Beautiful, beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Sing it out, hallelujah.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   You have broken every chain.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.

[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   As the flame of the Lord's heaven.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   As the flame of the Lord's heaven.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Jesus, yours is the victory.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   You have broken every chain.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Sing it out, hallelujah.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   You have broken every chain.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Lord, you are my living hope.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Amen.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   You may be seated.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Hi, everyone.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   My name is Diane Lee, and I am a first year student at UC Irvine.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Growing up in a Korean Presbyterian church
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   for the majority of my life, I was always
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   surrounded by God's word and the church.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   I collected biblical head knowledge,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   which was something I prided myself of as a young child.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   However, I was not able to accept these biblical truths
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   in my heart.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Although I never doubted God's existence or Christ's sacrifice
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   that was mercifully gifted to us,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   it never became a personal testament to my faith
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   until much later in my life.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   At the age of 12, during a junior high summer retreat,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I experienced what I thought was true salvation.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   It was the first time my biblical head knowledge
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   pierced my heart and allowed me to see what it truly
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   means to follow Jesus and live for his kingdom.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   However, my emotion-driven spiritual high
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   died down as soon as we drove off from the retreat site.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   This pattern continued for the rest of my years
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   in junior high and high school.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I saw my spiritual life in waves that
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   would rise during and after a spiritual revival
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and later die down during the stagnant periods of my life.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I was afraid to let go of my sinful desires
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   because I was self-driven and prideful
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   in my worldly accomplishments.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I had no desire to turn away from sin.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   In fact, I wanted to reap the benefits of salvation
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   without dying to my worldly desires.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Despite my lack of true salvation,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   I was under the impression that I was truly saved.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Because of this, I made the choice
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   to get baptized in ninth grade through the sprinkling
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   of water, motivated by my selfish desire
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   to join an exclusive club of young baptized believers.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Even in my sprinkling baptism, I was
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   driven by external motives, and I lacked
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   a true heart of repentance.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   During my senior year of high school,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   in the midst of the pandemic, I fell
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   into a period of depression that stemmed
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   from the contentment I felt sitting in my sin.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   At this point in my life, I pushed God away
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   and placed my trust on the world rather than God's promises.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   I was a slave to sin, feeding into my own desires
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   while still considering myself a believer
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   because I believed the events of the Bible to be true.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I tried to fill the emptiness I felt with sinful pleasures,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and although only God can bring true joy
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   and fulfillment in my life, I had no real desire
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   to turn to God nor put my trust in him.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   After all the time I spent constantly relying on the world,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   my older brother urged me to read the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   as a reminder that the pleasures I find in the world
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   are fleeting and temporary, but God's promises are forever.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Ecclesiastes 2, 11 says, "Thus I considered
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   all my activities which my hands had done,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   and the labor which I had exerted.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And behold, all was vanity and striving after wind,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   and there was no profit under the sun."
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Through the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   God convicted my heart and reminded me
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   that my depression stemmed from my desire to worship myself
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   through what the world had to offer.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   For the first time in my life,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   I understood the weight of God's promises
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   and how they are so much greater than the futile pleasures
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   I had been pursuing for my entire life.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Coming into college, God continued to reveal his glory to me
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and ultimately led me to a church that would grow my faith
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and give me a solid foundation of the word.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   I came to Berean by mere chance when a mutual on Instagram
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   recommended me to come to Berean's college welcome event.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   God led me to Berean in the strangest way
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   and continued to get me plugged into the church by his grace.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Towards the beginning of my first winter quarter,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   I felt a deep need to examine my heart
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   and where I stand before God.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I realized how much of my life had been displeasing to God
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   and how much I went to church for my own self-justification.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Although my head knowledge of the Bible
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   led me to think that I had salvation,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   I couldn't let go of my worldly desires
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   and try to love both God and the world,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   thinking that I can enjoy the pleasures of both,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   although God's promises truly outweigh the world's.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   I became a true believer at this time
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   when I truly died to my worldly desires
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   and offered up my whole life, not just part of it, to Christ.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   By his grace, God planted this conviction in me
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   after 19 years of being a superficial churchgoer.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   The Spirit has allowed me to see the weight of my sin
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and how it isn't possible to love both my sin and God.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   As a sinner, through the resurrection of Christ on the cross
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   and the atonement for sin,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I am truly able to come before God as his child.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Ultimately, as a true believer,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I now live not to fulfill my own desires,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   but I live to glorify God in all that I do,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   for his promises are eternal
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   and much greater than anything that this world could possibly offer.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Thank you.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   [applause]
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   [inaudible]
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   [applause]
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   All right, Diane, thank you for your testimony.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I was wondering if that "Lee" was Korean or Chinese,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and you confirmed it when you did this.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   That has to be Korean.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Okay, if you could turn your Bibles with me
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   to Matthew 16, 13-16.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   We're continuing our series to prepare us
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   for the Passion Week that's coming,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and so I wanted to go through chronologically.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   We started in the book of Isaiah, the prophecies,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   and the expectations of the Messiah,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   and then now the birth of Christ and the announcement,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and then now Jesus is headed toward the cross,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   and he is transitioning from his public ministry
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   to private ministry to his disciples.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   And so the things that he says here
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   is to get his disciples ready for what's coming.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And so we're going to be going through
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   the Gospel of Mark 8, 9, and 10,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   and in those passages, certain things that he says
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   to prepare them, but chapter 16, 13-16,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   is a parallel passage that I want to read,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   and then we'll be jumping into Mark after that.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   So Matthew 16, 13-16, and then I'll read verse 21.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   "Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   he was asking his disciples, 'Who do people say
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   that the Son of Man is?'
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   but still others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.'
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   the Son of the living God.'"
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And then verse 21, "From that time Jesus began
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   and the scribes, and be killed,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   and be raised up on the third day."
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Let's pray.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your grace
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   to help us to understand this text.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   And as we prepare ourselves, Lord God,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   to celebrate, to remember, to walk with Christ
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   in his last day of life, physical life,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   help us, Lord God, to know you, to love you,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   to be united in every way, physically, emotionally,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   spiritually, that we may understand his heart,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   that we may understand his suffering,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   that we may also celebrate in his glory.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   So we pray for your guidance and your Holy Spirit
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   to teach us this morning.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   This question that Jesus asks his disciples,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Based upon how you answer this question,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   your whole trajectory of life will change.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Now I know that we're--I'm talking to the choir here
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   because we're inside the church.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   You're at a Bible-teaching church where we're doing
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Bible studies, digging through Scripture.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   So, you know, we would automatically think
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   that this is not necessary.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I would assume that you have an Orthodox view
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   of who Jesus is.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   In our culture, we have all kinds of opinions.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Muslims, if you've ever talked to a Muslim,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   they'll say that they also believe in Jesus,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   but the Jesus that they profess is just a prophet.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   He just happens to be the latest prophet.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   So if you ask them this, "No, we believe in Jesus too."
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   But obviously the Jesus that they proclaim
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   is not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Hindus will also say that they believe in Jesus,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   but the Jesus that they believe is just one of many idols.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   So as they worship all kinds of different idols,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   they will just add Jesus to the many hundreds,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   thousands of idols that they follow.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And so oftentimes you ask somebody to try
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   to share the faith with them, and say,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   "No, we don't reject Jesus. We believe in Jesus."
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   But clearly their Jesus is not the Jesus
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   that we believe in Scripture.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Jehovah's Witnesses will also say that they believe in Jesus,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   but their Jesus is a created being,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   a son of God, but not God himself.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   So though they may use the name Jesus,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   and the gospel superficially may sound the same,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   we know that the Jesus that they profess
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   is not the same Jesus.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Mormons will also say that they are believers of Jesus,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   but their Jesus is only the highest created being
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   that we are to follow, and eventually that we will,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   if we work hard enough, that we will also be like Jesus
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   and have our own places to rule.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And so the Jesus that they profess
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   clearly is not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   But we're not confused about this Jesus here.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   The majority of us, maybe there's a few of you
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   maybe confused, but the majority of us here
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   are here because we know the difference between
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   the gods that they profess,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   even if they use the same name,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   is not the same Jesus that we profess.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Our struggle is not with that,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   because we can see that clearly.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   If you know even a superficial understanding of Scripture,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   you know that the Jesus that they teach
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   is not the same Jesus that we worship.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   The struggle for us is even within the evangelical,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   even within what we would profess to be,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   profess to be orthodox in teaching,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   people have different opinions of Jesus.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Is Jesus an angry God who is always ready to pounce?
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   He's a holy, holy, holy God who will not tolerate any sin,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and whatever you do, like Jesus is going to pounce.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   And every bad thing that happens in your life
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   is because God is punishing you for something
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   that you've done wrong, because God is a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Or is Jesus an all-loving God,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   that because He died for us,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   that even though He doesn't want us to sin,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   that even if you live a life of rebellion,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   even after, that God forgives us,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   and He loves us unconditionally,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   and that no matter what we do,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   God is not going to change our eternal destiny.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And so, is that the Jesus that's professed in the Scripture?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   He doesn't care about our holiness,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   because it's just about His holiness.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Some today, especially in the last maybe year or two,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   there's been a big divide in the churches.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Is Jesus the Jesus of the social justice?
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Like, primary call of Jesus,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   is He telling the church now
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   that our primary task needs to be to feed the poor,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   the people who are oppressed, to deliver them,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   and so the churches have divided over this issue.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Is that the Jesus of the Bible?
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   And so this question of, "Who do you say Jesus is?"
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   is crucial, not only in our proper theology,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   but knowing who Jesus is.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Our understanding of the biblical Jesus
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   has direct effect on how we run the church,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   what we teach, how we live our lives.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   The reason why all this is relevant
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   is because the whole purpose of Jesus' ministry
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   with His disciples is to get to this point
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   where Jesus would ask, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   So I'm going to try to give you a brief timeline
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   and the chronology of what is happening.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   When Jesus asks this question,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   it happens right after Jesus feeds the 5,000.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And so the feeding of the 5,000 that is recorded
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   in all the Gospels, but in particular in John 6,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Jesus feeds the 5,000, and every single person that was there,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   so 5,000 is the number of men that were there.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   If you count the women and children,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   easily it could be over 20,000.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   So this is the largest crowd that He's had,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and every single person there
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   saw the miracle that Jesus performed.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   And so as a result of that, many of them said
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   they wanted to forcefully make Him king.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   But at the end of that chapter, Jesus says,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   "The only reason why I fed you
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   is because you would know who I am."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   And His popularity grew so vast
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   that He just could not rest.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   So He would break away and go to the other side of the lake,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   and they would find out He's not there,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   and they'd pack up their bags, and they would not leave Him alone.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And when they finally find Jesus on the other side,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Jesus says to them, "You do not come to Me
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   because you know who I am.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   You come to Me because you ate bread and you want more."
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   In other words, you don't know who I am.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   So Jesus says, "I am the bread of life.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   If you do not eat of My flesh and drink of My blood,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   you cannot have any relationship with Me."
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   And as a result of that, it says in John 6, 66--666.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   From that point on, He said,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   "Many of the disciples stopped following Him."
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   And so typically when we think of Jesus' rejection,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   we think of Jerusalem.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   He's riding on the donkey. He's headed toward the cross,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   and say, "Crucify Him, crucify Him."
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   But the public rejection of Jesus
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   actually happened right after the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   So as soon as that happened, Jesus begins to pay--
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   turn His attention toward His disciples.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   So He takes Him up to the upper part of Galilee in Capernaum,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   and He begins to prepare His disciples.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   And after Peter makes this confession,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   He begins to slowly--
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   if you look at the timeline and the geography,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Jesus begins to slowly move down Galilee to Samaria,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   and then eventually to Bethany,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   and then to Jerusalem, and then to the cross.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   So when He's asking this question,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   He already has His mind set to begin to move.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   And that's why after the confession in verse 21,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   it says, "From that time, Jesus began to show His disciples
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   that He must go to Jerusalem."
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   So in other words, that time meaning
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   when the disciples finally truly understood who He was.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   "I am the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   And He said, "This is not something that you found out by yourself.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   God had opened your eyes to know who I am."
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   So think about it from the disciples' point of view.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   "I knew it!"
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   You know, "We suspected!"
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   But Jesus was always kind of like, you know, slippery with who He was.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Even though He did say it, but He says, "You're right.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   This is from God. I am the Messiah."
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Messiah meaning the one--I am the one who will come to deliver you.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   In fact, I'm beyond that. Not only am I your king,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   I'm the Son of the God.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And so He says, "After that, now that you know,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   now that it's confirmed, we're ready to do some work."
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   But right after that, He says, "Because of that," He says,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   "I'm going to go to Jerusalem, and the elders,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   the chief priests, and the scribes,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   they're going to kill me."
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   If you're the king, you know, the disciples were probably thinking,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   "Well, if you're the king, and you're the Messiah,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   and you're the Son of God, let's go!
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Let's go to Jerusalem and build this kingdom that we've been waiting for.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   We've been waiting. All the prophets have been talking about how when the Messiah comes,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   He's going to overturn the world, and He's going to bring peace,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   and everything that they've been dreaming of is going to happen when the Messiah comes."
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   So the disciples were probably thinking, "Yes!"
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   And we knew it.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   But He said, from that time on, He said, "No, I'm going to go.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   I am the king. You're right. I am the Son of God. You're right.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   But I'm going to suffer, and I'm going to die."
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Clearly, it didn't make much sense to them.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   And you know how sometimes you have this paradigm,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   and you think one way, and somebody says something that doesn't fit,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   and it just doesn't register, right?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Now, I debated whether I should tell this story or not,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   but I'm going to give you a shortened version of this.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   This is probably inappropriate, but I'm going to tell you anyway.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   I grew up with three brothers.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   So I was not around females much,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   because we moved almost every single year.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   So we had family friends who were females,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   but all three of us, we were just like this three of us.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And so the reason why I tell you that is because I knew nothing about females,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   only through my mom.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And so there was a lot of personal hygiene stuff that females had.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Okay, and I'm not going to go into details.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   I did not understand until I got married.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   And people usually ask me, like,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   "Didn't you take health class in junior high school?"
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   Clearly, I was not a good student.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   And they showed charts and all this stuff.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   It just didn't register.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   And then after I got married, Esther told me what every female--
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I'm 24, and I knew nothing of this.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   And when she told me, I was like, "What?
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   This happens every month?"
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   I'm not kidding.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   But the thing is, I've been around it, and I didn't understand this.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   I was a youth pastor as early as I was 19 or 20,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   and I remember--and there's so many stories I could tell you.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   But I remember one particular--we were going up to the retreat,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   and we just stopped by the bathroom, and I'm driving this van,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   and one of the female teachers taps me on the shoulder and says,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   "Hey, Peter, we need to pull over."
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   And I said, "Why?"
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Like 10 minutes ago, we went to the bathroom,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   and he said, "We need to pick up some female stuff."
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   And I'm thinking, "Why do you need makeup in the middle of nowhere?"
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   [laughter]
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   Literally, that's what I was thinking.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   We just went to the bathroom.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Clearly, they can't go to the bathroom.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   She couldn't believe that I didn't understand.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   She said, "No, we really need to pull over."
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   So because they demanded, I pulled over, and they went in,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   and whatever it was, it was in a brown paper bag, and they came back.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   And the whole time, I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   that I had to pull over to get makeup."
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   And that was kind of in my head.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   I told you it was inappropriate.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   I used to be a janitor when I was 19, 20 years old
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   at Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   and I cleaned bathrooms for eight hours a day
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   from 5 to 2 in the morning.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And so whenever I would go to the ladies' bathroom,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   they had an extra basket in there that I did not understand
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   because there's a--okay, there's a--
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   I'll just finish it here, okay?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   They have a separate trash can,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   and then they have a separate bag inside the stall.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   So it was my job to empty all of that and put new bags in.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   But the whole time, I was thinking,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   "Why do they need this tiny little trash can in here?"
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   They got the big trash can outside, right?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Anyway, so many things have happened.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   When Esther told me what that is, I'm like, "What?"
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And I can't--for days, I'd be driving, and it's like, "Oh."
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   That's why they wanted me to pull over.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   And I was like, "Oh, that's what the bags were for," you know?
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   And one time, I dropped it by mistake,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   and all the content fell out, and I did not understand.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   It's like, "Oh, that's what that was."
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And all that time, my mom would have, like, makeup removers,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   but why does she need a whole bag of makeup removers?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   I said, "Oh, they're not makeup removers."
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   So all this stuff that I didn't understand for 24 years,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   it's just like the puzzle started coming together.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   It was such a big part of, you know, every female's life,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   and I just didn't understand.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   I heard it, you know?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   I heard it.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   I was around it.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   I've seen it.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   But because I didn't have a framework to accept this
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   or understand this, I just had my own idea of what they were,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   and some of the stuff was very frustrating, you know?
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   It wasn't until that came into view, it was like,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   "Oh, all these pieces, like the puzzles,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   just finally came together."
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   This is such a bad illustration, but--
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   But I couldn't think of anything that illustrates this, you know,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   so well because the disciples--
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   This is so bad.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   I mean, the disciples, like, hearing so clearly--
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   All right, let's move on, all right?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   In Mark 8, 31-37, Jesus said,
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   "He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the scribes,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   and be killed, and after three days, rise again."
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   And then verse 32, it says, "He was stating the matter plainly."
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   So Mark goes out of his way to tell us that they shouldn't have missed this
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   because Jesus made this very plain,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   and the word for plain could either be translated boldly or openly.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   He was not making it vague anymore.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   But the disciples would hear this, and Peter's response is,
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   "He took him aside and began to rebuke him."
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Remember, Peter is the one who just said--
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   This is years later--
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Who just said, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   And then right after that, he takes Jesus aside and he rebukes him.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   And the audacity of that, right?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   I don't believe that Peter was doing this for sinful reasons, not in his heart.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   I think he genuinely loved Jesus, and you could clearly see that.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   If you read the Gospels, Peter, I mean, loved Jesus.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   He was so loyal to him.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   In fact, Peter says in Matthew 26, 33,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   "Even though all may fall away because of you, I will never fall away."
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   And I don't think that when Peter said that, he was joking.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   In fact, remember at the Garden of Gethsemane, Peter was the one who took the life out.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   And if you read the context, historical context of that,
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   the guards who came probably outnumbered them possibly 100 to 1.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   And these are trained soldiers of the temple who came to get him.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   And Peter took out a sword and said, "Let's go. I'm willing to die."
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   I mean, this is the guy who would walk out into the lake.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   You know what I mean? Most people would not have done that.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   What if I drowned? He said he loved Jesus.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   I mean, he just--he's a man of action.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   So when he said, "I will never--even if they all do, I won't,"
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   I think he meant it in his heart.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   But here's the key to what Jesus says, what went wrong,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   not only with Peter, but with all the other disciples.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   Verse 33, he said, "But turning around and seeing his disciples,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   he rebuked Peter and said, 'Get behind me, Satan.'"
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Remember, this is the same guy where Jesus said,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   "Upon this rock I will build my church, and gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   You know, you can imagine the pride in his heart,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   even though he was referring to the confession itself.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Peter was the one who made this confession.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   And to that same guy, when he says he's going to build his church
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   because of his confession, he says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Can you imagine Peter hearing that?
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   It's like, "I'm Satan now?" Right?
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   You're going to build this church upon Satan?
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   What does this mean?
[00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   But this is what he says, "For you are not setting your mind on God's interest, but man's."
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Peter was not rejecting Christ.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Peter was not running to idols.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   But his pride and his loyalty was mixed.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   When Jesus says, "The reason why you missed me,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   the reason why you don't understand what's going on is because you have the interest of man and not God's."
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   The danger of misplaced love and loyalty oftentimes is our greatest fault.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   Our problem is not oftentimes with the obvious false gospels.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   We see it coming.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   If you know the Bible, even just elementary,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   if somebody says, "Jesus was not resurrected from the dead."
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   No, I don't believe that.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   "Jesus was a created being."
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   No, that's heresy.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   That you have to earn your salvation.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   We can recognize that, and that doesn't easily penetrate into the church.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   But what we struggle with is tweaked priorities.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   That in our loyalty, oftentimes to our families, to a decent way of life,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   providing oftentimes takes us away from what is best.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Good versus what's best.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   That's usually our struggle.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Not between heresy and orthodoxy.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Not between loving Christ and hating Christ.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   But loving Christ, but loving the things that are good more.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   See, good is a long life loved by community around us.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   That's good.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Our children, taking care of them, paying for bills, it's good.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   Plenty of time to enjoy the hard work that we've done
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   and have plenty of time and money to be able to travel and enjoy nice things.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Those are good things.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   None of these things are heretical things.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   Buy some nice things and live peacefully with our neighbors.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   Be generous to the people around us when they are in need.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Be gracious to everyone.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   To love and to be loved by all the people around us.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   Every single one of these things are good.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   But the problem is that oftentimes what is good competes with what's best.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   What's best is whatever God desires.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   To follow and trust even if that path leads to greater suffering.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   Maybe even forfeit sometimes what is good so that we can have what is best.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Best is whatever leads to salvation.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Best is whatever leads to sanctification.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Best is whatever leads to glorification.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   Best is whatever leads to the maximum glory of God.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   Even at times when it seems to forfeit what is good.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   See, Peter and the disciples had their minds set on what is good.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   The kingdom is going to come.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Let me sit on your left and to the right.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   And they were so fixated on that when Jesus says I'm going to the cross.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   It just didn't register.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   Because it didn't make sense.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   And so even as Jesus is telling them I'm going to die, I'm going to suffer,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   they're going to pierce me.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   They're thinking of something completely off the wall.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   He says in verse 34, "And he summoned the crowd and his disciples and said to them,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   'If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   and follow me.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   and the gospels will save it.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?'"
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   We typically think of denying ourselves and picking up the cross means God presents
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   all these good things in front of us and then he says you can't have it.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   But in reality what he's doing is the very instinct that we have for self-preservation,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   and self-preservation includes our family and children and our loved ones,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   our natural instinct for survival is killing us.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   And so what he's saying is he's not presenting what is good and then say you can't have it.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   I want to live the rest of your life to suffer, to deny yourself, to win over temptation.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   And then when you get to heaven, hopefully in glorification, if you've taken enough shots to yourself,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   if you lived hard enough and sacrificed enough and suffered enough,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   hopefully you'll make it to heaven and glorify and then all your rewards are up in heaven.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   That's not what he is saying.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   He's saying when he says to deny yourself, to deny the very thing that caused Adam and Eve
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   to live in rebellion, when they rebelled, they didn't rebel saying I want to worship idols
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   and I don't love Jesus or I don't love God.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   They just wanted what God had for themselves.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   What's so bad about that? What's so bad about wanting wisdom?
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   But it is in their search for survival.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   They began to search for life outside of God.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   And it is in this tweak.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   And that's why Jesus says if you don't recognize that true life is on the other side of the cross,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   that you need to deny yourself, that you need to put away your old life.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   The problem in the struggle that you and I have is the temptation to add Jesus.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   To have what the world has and I want to have peace of mind too to go to heaven.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   I want to have all the comfort and all the peace and all the safety and all the proper education
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   for our children to travel everywhere everybody else goes and then to add Jesus to that
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   so that I could be even better on top of everything that I have,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   that I would also have the peace of mind that when I die I'll be in heaven.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Not realizing the very thing that you think is bringing life is actually is what's causing damage.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   It's this desire to live outside, pursuing life, thinking that there's life there.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   What Jesus is saying, no, that's not where life is.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   Actually, that's leading you to greater death.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   And we hear it all the time. We hear it in Ecclesiastes.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   We hear it from people who have gone before us.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   We hear people who are multi-billionaires and have all the accolades of the world
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   and then they jump off a building because something went wrong.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   And then we just couldn't fathom why would they do such a thing?
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   They had everything that we desire and yet they jumped off.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   What was wrong with them?
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   Maybe something went wrong in their childhood because it doesn't fit our paradigm.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Because we live all our lives trying to get what they have.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   It is into that that Jesus is speaking to is our very instinct to live.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Is what's choking our life.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   Jim Elliot, you guys know him, the young missionary who gave his life.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   And he wrote this in his early 20s.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   "He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to attain what he cannot lose."
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   This is a 22, 23 year old man.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   He understood that true life is in Christ.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   And he lived that way and he died that way.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   And there's a reason why this young man who died decades ago,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   we still speak about him because it's consistent with what we see in Scripture.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Right after this encounter, Jesus takes James, John, and Peter to the Mount of Transfiguration.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   He made that confession but now he wanted to make sure they hear from God himself.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   God's been speaking to you from a distance but now you're going to hear his audible voice to tell you, to confirm.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Before he goes to the cross, so that they have these witnesses that can say after the resurrection,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   "I heard him audibly."
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   So the whole thing that Jesus was trying to do, more than, you know, when you go out, make disciples,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   this is what you need to do, you know, make sure when you go to this person.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   And yes, he did teach them that.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   But the very thing that he was trying to teach the disciples is that they may be able to have the right confession of Jesus.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   The right confession, right view of who Jesus is.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   After that, Mark chapter 9, 30-37, as he is making his way to Jerusalem,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   "From there they went out and began to go through Galilee.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   And he did not want anyone to know about it, for he was teaching his disciples and telling them,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   'The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him, and when he has been killed, he will rise three days later.'"
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   So he's giving more specific revelation as he goes, but in verse 32,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   "But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him."
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   You ever get behind in something so bad that you can't even ask questions?
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   You know what I mean?
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   My parents moved around so much, you know, every single year we were in a different school,
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   so whenever they would do something and I didn't understand, I just thought, "Oh, maybe they were taught before and I didn't hear it."
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   So I was embarrassed to even ask questions.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   You know, it's like, if I asked them a question, what if people laughed because it was such a basic question?
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   You ever experienced that? Right?
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   Some of you guys are too smart, huh?
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   You were the one that embarrassed other people.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   I think the disciples are so behind, you know, and they just, because they didn't understand.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Like, you're the Messiah, you said, you're the Son of the Living God,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   and you're going to what?
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   They're going to beat you and kill you?
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   I don't get that.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   I must admit something.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   Maybe Jesus said something early in the morning and I wasn't there.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   You know, maybe I slept in.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   Maybe he taught it and I didn't get it.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   So they were so behind that they were afraid to ask him.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   Verse 33, "They came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house, he began to question them,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   'What were you discussing on the way?'
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   But they kept silent, for on the way they discussed with one another which of them was the greatest."
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   So clearly they heard him.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   They heard him because Jesus, it says, Mark says, he said it very plainly.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   They heard it, but they didn't understand it, so they kept on going.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   He said, with their own framework, that when we go to Jerusalem, this is going to happen.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   And so they, look at even the question.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   They didn't ask who's great.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   The question was who's the greatest.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   Now, every single one of them were great because they're hand-picked disciples of Jesus Christ.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   But the competition wasn't with the other people.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   The competition wasn't with the Pharisees.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   It was among themselves.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   See, if we were to compete with people who are far from us,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   every single one of us would wake up every single day thinking,
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   "Thank God I'm in the United States."
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   Because we have more money than 99% of the world.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   We have more freedom than 99% of the world.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   I remember years ago when, some of you guys may remember the hanging Chad.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Remember the Republicans, Democrats, and the vote was so close, and the presidency was in line,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   and that thing that they poked through because it was done physically a while back.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   And then they had Chad that was hanging and say, "Did they actually mean to vote for, you know,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   vote for Gore or for, who's the other guy? Bush, right?"
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   And so they were fighting back and forth.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   They went all the way to the Supreme Court.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   And these guys who basically, superpowers, who had access to the military,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   went all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the Democrats lost.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   And they was like, "This is not fair."
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   And then they went back to work.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   And I remember watching that whole thing, like, if there's any time that a civil war would break out,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   it would be then.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   But it didn't break out.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   They lost, and they just went back to work.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   They're complaining and griping, but they went back to work.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   And I was thinking, "Man, if this happened in any other country, it would have been civil war."
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   They would have borne arms and went out to the street and physically tried to take,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   because this is unfair.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   And I remember thinking, like, "This is a great country."
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   Even with that much division, the country was able to continue.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   If we woke up and compared ourselves to other countries, to people who are far away,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   we wouldn't think like that.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   But we don't compare with people who are far away.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   Our natural instinct is to compete with the people in the room, people who are around us.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   And that's exactly what the disciples were doing.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   They weren't comparing themselves with the poor people or the lepers or the blind or the tax collectors.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   They compared themselves with themselves.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   The discussion was, "Who's the greatest?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Who's the greatest in God's kingdom?"
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   Verse 35, it says, "Sitting down, he called the twelve and said to them,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   'If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last, of all and servant of all.'"
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   You notice here at the beginning of verse 35, it emphasizes that he sat down.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   I mean, it seems insignificant, right?
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   In the context of this important prophecy of what's happening to Jesus, he said, "Oh, he sat down."
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   There's a cultural significance to that because today,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   if we want to emphasize that somebody was really animated or would say something,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   he said, "He got off his chair and he began to speak."
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   That's how we would express, like, this was important enough that he jumped out of his seat to talk to people.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   Well, in that culture, for the rabbi to sit down means, "Okay, now, this is important."
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Because the habit was he would teach and he would tell them,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   and typically he would stand in front of the crowd and he would make his statements,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   but he says, "He sat down," meant, "You need to hear this. This is formal."
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   Like, this needs to sink in.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   He sat down and says, "Your desire to want to be first is what's making you last.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   And if you want to be first in God's kingdom, you have to be the servant of all."
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   And then in verse 36, it says, "Taking a child, he set him before them,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   and taking him in his arms, he said to them, 'Whoever receives one child like this in my name receives me,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   and whoever receives me does not receive me, but him who sent me.'"
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   I've heard people say that he chose a child because they're innocent.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   They're kind of dumb, right?
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Dumb meaning that they're not going to challenge you.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   So our faith needs to be like a child who, if God says to jump, say, "How high?"
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   That's not why he uses the child.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   He's using this child because they have no authority.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   They have no power.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   You know, you can take a child from a rich family and take a child from a very poor family
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   and put them on a playground.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   They play together and they become best friends.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   It's the parents that will separate them.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   So when he chooses a child, he said, "You guys are all competing to see who's better and who's the greatest."
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   And then he takes a child who has no power, no money, no authority, no honor,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   and he says, "You must receive one another like this child.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   You want to receive me, you have to receive me like this child."
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   In other words, your whole paradigm, your whole paradigm, your pursuit has been tainted by sin.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   You're desiring for honor, desiring for some people to recognize you.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Everything that we do from the moment that we're born, we ask this question, "Who's the greatest?"
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   You have a child, young parents who talk to each other.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   It's like, "Oh, they're walking? How old are they?"
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   "Ten." "Oh, my child's not walking yet. Something must be wrong."
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   "Oh, he's two and he's talking? He's actually putting sentences together?"
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   "My kid barely puts one word."
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   "You're three? He's reading a book at three? He's doing what? At the age of five, he's running?"
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   "He plays sports like, 'Oh, my kid is really good at athletic.'"
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   "What? Really?"
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   All throughout life, we compare and compete.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   Then you go to school. "What school are you getting into?"
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   "What's your GPA?"
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   "What college did you go to?"
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   "What job do you have?"
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   "How much do you get paid?"
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   "Where do you work?"
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   "What kind of car do you drive?"
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   "Where do you live?"
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   Then you get married, and you start that cycle with your own kids.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   "Oh, where are you retiring? You put enough money away?"
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   All these things are very superficial, but it's indicative of what's happening in our hearts.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   As soon as you walk into a room, we measure each other.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   Who's good-looking? Who's dressed nice?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   Who's taller? Who's shorter?
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   Who's built? Who's out of shape?
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   We measure ourselves internally and externally.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   If we don't live up to whatever the standard is, we have self-esteem issues.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   And if we think we're slightly better than other people, we start to fill up with pride.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   And this instinct, this natural instinct that we have to want to live,
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   has been completely saturated by our fault.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   It's not just one thing. It's our whole pursuit in life.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   It leads us away from the author of life.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   That's why He says you have to go through with the cross, unless your old life dies.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   Unless you recognize, not just, "I sinned here because I lied, and I did this."
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   Our whole pursuit, our whole paradigm of what we think is good,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   causes us to rebel against God.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   Not shaking our fists, but just day-to-day decisions that we make.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   Day-to-day things like, "What frustrates you?"
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   "Because God didn't give me what I think is going to bring me life."
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   People suffer with bitterness and anger,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   because they have a paradigm in their head that, "This is what life looks like,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   and God didn't give it to me."
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Not realizing it's that very thing that's killing you.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   In Mark chapter 10, 32-45, it says,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   "They were on the road going to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   And they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   saying, 'Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   They will mock Him and spit on Him and scourge Him and kill Him.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   And three days later He will rise again.'"
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   Every time He mentioned His suffering, He told them that He's going to rise again.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   But we know clearly that they didn't understand, nor did they heard Him,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   because remember, after Jesus was resurrected, they didn't even go to check.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   You would think that after Jesus went to the cross, they're like, "Oh, I remember Him saying that."
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   They didn't even go to check. The women go to check on Him.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   In fact, when they came back and said, "Jesus is not there. He's resurrected."
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   Remember their response? "I can't believe you until I see it."
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   Mark says He said that very plainly, but it just wasn't in their paradigm.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   Why would the Messiah suffer? Why would He die? Why would He have to be resurrected?
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   So even though they heard it, it just didn't go off.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   But look at the response of James and John.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   "The two sons of David came to Jesus saying, 'Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.'"
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   In Matthew's account, it says, "Their mother came."
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   In other words, this was well planned.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   This was not just an impromptu kind of like, "Hey, hey, hey, I get it. You're going to the cross, whatever.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   But can we sit on your left and to the right?"
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   So in Matthew's account, the mother actually planned and went to Him and sought a time to talk to Him.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   And said, "Hey, now we're convinced you're the Messiah and you're not denying it anymore.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   Would you let my son sit on the left and to the right?"
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Verse 36, "He said to them, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   They said to Him, 'Grant that we may sit one to your right and one on your left in your glory.'"
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Can you imagine? These are His closest companions.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   And James and John is, they already saw the transfiguration, right?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   And so, humanly speaking, Jesus was leaning on these guys.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   If anybody should have understood, it would have been them.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Jesus just told them that, "I'm going to suffer.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   They're going to mock me. They're going to strike me. They're going to kill me."
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   And the very next statement is, "Can I touch some of your glory?"
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   That's what they were asking.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   Some of you guys who are married, it's kind of like, you come home and the dishes are all broken,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   and your wife is sitting there and she's crying her eyes out, and the guy comes in and says, "What's for dinner?"
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   Can you imagine the fury that you would be in?
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   You're so selfish, like clearly something happened and your wife is hurt and suffering,
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   and all you're thinking is, "What's for dinner?"
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Can you imagine, emotionally, as a human being, what Jesus was thinking when they asked this question?
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   I mean, I could easily imagine Jesus saying, "That's enough."
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   And you see, Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   He was going to experience the suffering that no human being has ever experienced.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   Physically, yes, other people have been crucified,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   but He was going to bear on Himself the sins of mankind.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   And He was on His knees, pleading with His Father.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   That scene in and of itself is such a strange scene.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   The God of the universe who created us is so vulnerable at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   and He wanted His disciples just to stay awake.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   That at least pray with me, to unload some of that burden, humanly speaking.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   And every time they come back, they're sleeping.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   Can you imagine the frustration in Jesus?
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   They would even possibly ask this question.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   But I mean, He is so patient.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   He says, "But Jesus said to them, 'You do not know what you are asking.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   Are you able to drink the cup that I drink to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?'"
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   And look at the way they answered, 39.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   "They said to Him, 'We are able.'"
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   It's probably the most arrogant statement that any human being has ever made.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   "We are able."
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   Clearly, they didn't understand.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   "Jesus said to them, 'The cup that I drink to you, you shall drink,
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   But to sit on my right or on my left, this is not mine to give,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.'"
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   Now, Jesus is not saying that James and John is going to absorb their sins on the cross.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   But what He is saying is the suffering that He experienced because of the cross,
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   the disciples will also experience.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   They're going to experience the suffering because of the cross
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   as they share the gospel, as they begin to understand.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   And so some of them were crucified, beheaded, burned at the stake, dropped in oil,
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   and they experienced the suffering because of the cross.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   "But to sit on my left or on my right, that's my Father."
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   So they did suffer this.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   In verse 41, "Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John."
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   Now, why were they indignant?
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   Because they were thinking the same thing.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   They were part of this argument.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   Who's the greatest?
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   They weren't indignant because they didn't hear Jesus.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   They weren't indignant because they were concerned about what Jesus was thinking.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   They were indignant because they wanted to bypass them.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   How many times do other people's pride bother us because it affects God
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   or because we feel disrespected?
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   So the disciples weren't indignant because they somehow dishonored God
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   or how dare you ask that question right after what Jesus said.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   It's because they wanted to bypass them and be greater than them.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   So even in their indignation, it was competing with one another.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   How much of the suffering that you and I experience is because we live with this paradigm,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   who is the greatest?
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   Now, we're sophisticated enough that we don't say these words.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   But how often do you learn something and the very next thought is, "You don't know."
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   How often do you experience something and the very next thought is,
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   "You didn't experience what I experienced."
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   How often do you bear fruit and then the very next thought is,
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   "You didn't bear the fruit that I bore."
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   How much of our paradigm, even in our passionate pursuit of Christ,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   in the back of our mind is, "Who's the greatest?
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   Who's the greatest?"
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   Not realizing that that is what's causing us to be blind.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   It's ruining our marriages.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   It's ruining our friendships.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   It's ruining our society.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   And it's ruining the church.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Corinthian church.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   That was the heart of the problem of the Corinthian church.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   It wasn't, "I don't want Jesus," or, "I'm going to rebel against God."
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   It was, "Well, who should be sitting on the top spot?
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   Paul?
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   Apollos?
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   Jesus?
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   Peter? Who? Who should be there?"
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   The reason why they were competing with one another,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000]   because whoever that they aligned themselves with,
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   if they are in the top spot, that means we're going to be with them.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   If we align ourselves with somebody who's better than the others,
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   that we're going to receive some of this glory.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   And that was ruining the church.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   How much of our pursuit of our own glory is blinding us,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   and is affecting our affection for Christ?
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   Verse 42, "Calling them to himself, Jesus said to them,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   'You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them,
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   and their great men exercise authority over them,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   but it is not this way among you.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   But whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be a slave of all.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.'"
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   You know, the greatest and the fastest way to be humble is to be humiliated.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   I remember I had a youth student.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   We were doing a study on Jesus' humility, and she said, "I really want to be humble."
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   And she went to this church and asked this mega church pastor to pray for her.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   And then she said, "How can I pray for you?"
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   And she said, "I want humility."
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   And the pastor stopped and said, "Are you sure you want me to pray for that?"
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   And he was kind of taking it back.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   "Yes, of course."
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   And he said, "If I pray for this, God may answer through humiliation.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   Do you still want this?"
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   And I remember that that stuck with me even to this day because it's so true.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   The fastest and the easiest path to humility is humiliation.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   Jesus, the Son of God, deserving of praise from all of creation for eternity,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   the Messiah, the Son of the living God, was stripped naked for all mankind to see.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   His family, friends, mother, companions, disciples,
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   people who honored Him, loved Him, followed Him,
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   they stripped Him naked to hang on that cross.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   He was humiliated.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   The only man who deserved all praise, honor, and glory
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   was stripped naked, beaten, mocked for all to see.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   All for what?
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   All for what?
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   So that He can save the proud.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   So He can save me and you.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   So that you and I can come to this room and worship Him.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   So our eyes can be open to the true life in Christ.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   How foolish to worship this God and to live the rest of our lives
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   thinking to ourselves, "Who's the greatest?"
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   How are we any different than the disciples?
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   I pray that as we study, meditate, and walk with Christ toward the cross,
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   that we would recognize the foolishness of the disciples
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   and come to Christ with empty vessels.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   So often we come to Christ with our cups filled,
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   with our temptations, with our desires, with our hopes,
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   with our pride, and say, "Fill me, fill me."
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   Like, where? Where am I going to fill you?
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   You're already filled with yourself.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   That this Easter season, that each one of us would learn to empty ourselves.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   Empty.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   That we would come to the Lord Friday at the communion table
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   humbled before the Lord, recognizing what He did for us
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   through the humiliation that He went through
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   so that you and I could be called the children of God
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   and come empty.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000]   So that when we ask the Lord to fill our cup,
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   that we would be ready to receive.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   Let's pray.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   Gracious Father, all glory and honor belongs to You.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   You are deserving of our praise.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   You are deserving of our finances.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   You are deserving of our hope.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   You are deserving of our youth.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   You are deserving, Lord God, of whatever life that remains in us.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   You are deserving.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   Help us, Lord God, to take our eyes off of ourselves.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize the foolishness
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   of the competition, of competing,
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   and thinking that there is life outside of You in any way.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000]   I pray, Father God, that as we walk with Christ,
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   as He deliberately made a choice to go to the cross
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   and suffer on our behalf,
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   that You would bring renewal, revival in our hearts,
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   that whether we are mature Christians
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   or whether we have just begun our journey,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   that Christ would be exalted.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   Teach us, Lord God, to be anchored to Him.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   Teach us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Jesus,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000]   Would you all stand up with me for the closing praise?
