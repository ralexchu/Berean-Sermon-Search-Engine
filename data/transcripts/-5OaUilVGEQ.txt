[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   [music]
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.640]   We close the week on this Friday, looking forward to our next sermons, Sunday morning.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.280]   This is because in just about every Bible text we face unanswerable questions, things
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.060]   we simply don't know.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.960]   So what do preachers and teachers do with those uncertainties?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.520]   Do we take creative license?
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.800]   Do we guess and make things up?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.360]   Do we speculate?
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.800]   Or do we just tell people what we don't know?
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.080]   It's a great practical question from Mark who lives in Montana.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.200]   Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.840]   Jesus tells us in John 12, 49, "I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.080]   who sent me has himself given me a commandment, what to say and what to speak."
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.400]   And we trust that all scripture is breathed out by God.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.880]   That's 2 Timothy 3, 16.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.760]   So I have long struggled with how much embellishment and speculation we should bring into the pulpit.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.600]   Scripture does not include every possible detail for us, and the Church throughout the
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.720]   ages has in many cases tried to fill in those gaps.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.280]   Commentaries frequently say things like, "this may refer to," or they use qualifiers like
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.840]   "possibly" and "probably" to explain meanings that are uncertain.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.720]   So here's my question.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.960]   Is it okay for teachers and preachers to conjecture about what the Bible doesn't say?
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.920]   How much speculation should we bring into our sermons?
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.200]   Well, let's start with the easy part.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.120]   A pastor, a preacher, above all things, should be honest.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.560]   If he's not honest, none of his other qualities, not even his faith or his love, will count
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.040]   for anything, because the people simply won't be able to trust him.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.760]   They won't be able to trust that he has faith or trust that he really loves them.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.200]   A dishonest pastor can't make up for dishonesty by other virtues, because it's foundational.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   And it's foundational because truth is foundational.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880]   Honesty means telling the truth.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.240]   Preachers must tell the truth.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:25.400]   And what that means here in this context of this question is he can't say he knows what
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.280]   he doesn't know.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.640]   It would be a lie, and God won't honor that.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.400]   In other words, if he's not sure what a word or a phrase or a sentence in the sermon text
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.360]   means, he must not say he is sure what it means.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:54.600]   So the first principle of how much uncertainty you admit into a sermon is you admit as much
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.160]   as you must in order to be honest with what the people need to know.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.960]   Now that doesn't mean that you need to mention every single thing you don't know.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   That would take way too long.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.320]   The problem is not that there are many things we preachers don't understand and won't understand
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.200]   until Jesus comes.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   That's not the problem.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.320]   That's true of all preachers.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.920]   The problem is with stating as true what you don't know to be true.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.080]   Now that's the easy part.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.320]   I say let's deal with the easy part first.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:43.120]   Mark is asking not mainly about presenting speculations as true, which is dishonest,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.280]   but presenting speculations at all.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.200]   That's more complicated.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.800]   And even though you don't have to tell your people every Sunday everything you don't know
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   about the text, you probably will have to tell them some things you don't know about
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.520]   the text.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:09.320]   At least if your people have grown to expect that you are a faithful expositor and you
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.280]   don't skip over hard things just because they're hard, then they'll want to know what your
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.200]   explanation is for the next sentence in the biblical text.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.400]   You might skip some things because you're dealing with some large text, say, in a sermon
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.560]   and you can't touch on everything, but over time we will lose the trust of our people
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.280]   if we are constantly skipping difficult sentences because we're not sure what they mean.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.320]   So what do you do if you see something in the text and you're not sure what it means?
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   Some words, some phrase, some logic.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.160]   What do you do?
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:57.880]   You tell people honestly that you're not sure what this word or phrase or logic or situation
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.000]   means.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.440]   Then you tell them what you think it means and you give them the reasons why you think
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.680]   that, that they can see in the text.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.160]   And then you tell them one or two of the other possible understandings and why you don't
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.600]   lean toward them.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:27.360]   And then, if you can, you show them elsewhere in the Bible that these two or three alternative
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200]   interpretations are all true to reality.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.080]   They're true to reality, even though you're not sure which of those realities is being
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.320]   referred to in this text.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:47.040]   In other words, you're not going to say that one of the possible interpretations is contradictory
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.420]   to the reality that other passages in the Bible clearly teach.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.200]   You're not going to fault the Bible as contradictory.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.640]   You're going to give your people the possible interpretations which, in fact, could be true
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.160]   given what is taught elsewhere in the Bible.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:15.320]   Now, there's one other angle on this issue of bringing speculation into Christian preaching
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.160]   that I want to mention, and I think Mark is getting at this in one of his concerns as
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.440]   well.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:32.480]   It has to do with the use that preachers make of sociological or philosophical or psychological
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:42.320]   or even canonical backgrounds to what the text says, which may or may not be the case.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's not obvious from the text.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.240]   So a preacher might say, "Paul got this emphasis from the Stoic philosophers, and then he Christianized
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240]   it."
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.920]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.280]   Or they might say that such and such a paragraph is an early Christian hymn.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.320]   Well, maybe, maybe not.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.400]   Or they might say that Paul was fond of attending the Olympic Games.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.280]   Well, maybe, maybe not.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.880]   Or they might speculate that Paul was a widower.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.560]   Or they might venture that he was a type A personality and would be an INTJ on the Myers-Briggs.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.080]   Or they might say that every reference to the Son of Man is an allusion to Daniel 7.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:42.800]   Now, my guess is that what's going on in some preaching is that the preacher has ceased
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:51.440]   to think of himself as an accountable emissary of God's infallible truth, whose job is
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.560]   to call people to believe things for which they're willing to risk their lives.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:06.880]   And instead, he's fallen into the pattern, kind of academic pattern or public communicator
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:14.360]   pattern of seeing himself as an interesting communicator who needs to hold people's attention
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.720]   with fascinating details, which may or may not be the case.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:34.540]   So my closing warning would be, to the degree that a preacher builds his sermons with materials
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:44.280]   that people cannot see for themselves in the Bible, to that degree, he loses authority
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.080]   and he loses the power to build faith.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:58.120]   And he has passed over into entertainment, even theologically rich entertainment, canonically
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:06.320]   captivating entertainment, which he thinks the people will find interesting, fascinating,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.080]   intriguing, whether they see it in the text or not.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   In fact, one of the yellow flags that I spot in preaching is when the pastor says, "Well,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.920]   I find it intriguing that," and then he gives me an interesting twist on the text with no
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.040]   support that I can build my life on.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.840]   And I want to stand up and shout.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.480]   I never have, but maybe I want to stand up and shout.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.280]   We're not here to learn what you find intriguing, Mr. Pastor.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.000]   We have come to hear the Word of God.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.440]   Tell us what God has to say to us.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.880]   And if you don't know, tell us you don't know.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.760]   And then go back to your study and get on your knees over your books and your Bible
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.280]   and wrestle until your hip's out of joint.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.920]   And then when you've got a message from God, bring it to us and we will be very, very thankful.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.160]   Yes, a life built on speculation about what the Bible might say is not going to hold up
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.160]   over time.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that reminder.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.960]   And thank you, Mark, for the excellent and practical question you gave us today.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.400]   If you have a question for Pastor John, send it our way.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.720]   Go to askpastorjohn.com to do so.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.920]   Well, we are going to step away for a few days over the weekend, and we're back next
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   week.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.240]   Thanks for listening.
