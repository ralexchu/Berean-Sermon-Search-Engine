[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.760]   Welcome to Breen Community Church, those of you who are here and those of you who are
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.760]   online.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   Again, today is our special Christmas service and obviously that normally we have children
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.840]   who perform, you know, they prepare and perform up here on the stage and obviously this year
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.480]   we're not able to do that.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.720]   It's been a very strange year this year, 2020.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560]   But again, we believe that God is sovereign, that even in the midst of all of this, that
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.700]   God has a purpose for all of this.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.440]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 1, I'm going to be reading from verse
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   22 through 25.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.000]   Okay, 1 Corinthians chapter 1, 22 through 25.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.900]   For in these Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.520]   To Jews a stumbling block and to the Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.520]   both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God, because the foolishness
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.240]   of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.120]   Let's pray.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.560]   Heavenly Father, we thank you and praise you for the privilege that we have to be able
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.160]   to come and worship you, especially now, Lord God, as we've gathered together to celebrate
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.520]   Christ's birth and what it means for us.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.480]   Help us, Lord God, to open our ears, our eyes, soften our hearts as you are the potter and
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.440]   we are the clay, that you would mold us according to your purpose and will.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.480]   So we pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would take the words that are taught and it
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.960]   would illuminate us that we may understand and apply it in our lives.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920]   Donald Trump.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920]   Okay.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.080]   As soon as I say his name, in our generation, you get different emotions, right?
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.940]   So the people, depending on where you stand on your politics, when you say Donald Trump,
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.400]   he is either Hitler or the best president the United States has ever had in history,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.020]   maybe next to Lincoln or better than Lincoln.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.140]   And obviously you have people who have opinions kind of on either side, variation.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.020]   Whatever your politics is, we have to admit that this political year probably has been
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.460]   the most polarizing of anything that I can remember.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.500]   And sad to say, churches and even some family members, there's so heated debates on either
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   side.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.060]   But whatever the case, Donald Trump was not going to save the world.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.580]   Our political system is made in such a way there's checks and balances, so that no matter
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.740]   what president is in there, they have other branches that kind of he needs to get permission
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.900]   and make sure that he doesn't have all power.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.580]   And no matter who gets elected, every four years they have to do it again.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.940]   And so someone else might come in and then whoever gets elected there, another person
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.940]   will come in.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.620]   He is not going to affect the eternity of mankind.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.500]   But there is an individual that you and I are here to celebrate that was equally even
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.820]   more polarizing.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.500]   Some said he was a crazy man.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.860]   He came and claimed to be the son of God and then fooled all these people.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.060]   Now 2,000 years later, millions of people have been fooled by this man and have wasted
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.140]   countless amount of money, lives, telling and proclaiming the things that he said that
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.900]   he was.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.780]   Or he actually was the son of God who came to save mankind.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.340]   C.S. Lewis says it like this about Jesus, "A man who was merely a man and said the sort
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.220]   of things that Jesus said and would not be a great moral teacher.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.840]   He would either be a lunatic on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg or else
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.160]   who would be the devil of hell.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   You must make your choice.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.160]   Either this man was and is the son of God or else a madman or something worse.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.040]   You can shut him up for a fool.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.500]   You can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.760]   and God.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.000]   But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.820]   He has not left that open to us.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.640]   He did not intend to."
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.600]   Where we stand on who Jesus is will either affect our eternity, we praise him as our
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.800]   Lord and Savior and so we believe that when we die that we have eternity with him for
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   eternity or we reject him as a crazy man.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.480]   There's nothing in between.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.360]   You cannot come and say, "Well, there's a lot of good things to learn from a man who
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.760]   said he was God."
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.880]   There's no good thing to glean from a person who said that he died and resurrected from
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.520]   the dead.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.800]   Either he really is what he says he is or he's a crazy man to be forgotten.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.020]   2,000 years later, Jesus' name is proclaimed more today than it was 2,000 years ago.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.960]   The effects that Jesus had on humanity, whether you believe or don't believe, we all agree,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.560]   had probably the greatest impact in human history.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   So today we want to look at in the early church when Christ was being proclaimed, the text
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   says as Apostle Paul was going to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, he says, "Some asked
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.920]   for signs.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.760]   The Jews asked for signs and the Greeks looked for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified."
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.720]   He said, "Christ crucified was a stumbling block to the Jews and it is foolishness to
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.600]   those who are looking for wisdom, but to those who are being saved it is the power of God
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.480]   and the wisdom of God."
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.720]   So let's look at first of all, why were the Jews asking for signs?
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.800]   I mean, you may have thought at least at one point in your life thinking that if Jesus
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.600]   would only just physically appear, right, if he just split the heavens open and says,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.120]   "I am," right, and say, "Oh, that would affect my walk."
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.200]   Why were the Jews constantly asking for signs?
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.040]   It wasn't because Jesus didn't give signs.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.600]   In fact, the Bible repeats it over and over that he kept on performing miracles to prove
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.280]   who he was.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.840]   Jesus changed water into wine.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.700]   He opened the eyes of the blind.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.700]   He healed lepers.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.960]   He walked on water.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.840]   And then he even actually raised people from the dead.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.520]   He's all of this to show who he said he was was true.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.880]   And yet the Bible keeps saying that they wanted more signs.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.800]   In John 2, 18, when he was at the temple and cleansed them, the leaders came to him and
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.220]   said, "What sign do you show?
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.840]   Show us as your authority for doing these things."
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.200]   Now you have to remember that Jesus performed these miracles not all over the land.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   Majority of his miracles happened in these three cities, basically the size of Orange
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.480]   County.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.860]   And for two years, everything that he did, so majority of the people there either heard
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.480]   of him or saw the miracle themselves.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.880]   In fact, the leaders of Israel in Jerusalem, which was kind of a distance between here
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.160]   and San Francisco, heard of Jesus' fame and all that he was doing, and they said, "Could
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.080]   he possibly be the Messiah?"
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.400]   So they all came up to Galilee in order to check this out because that's how clear he
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.440]   was.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.720]   He wasn't doing this in private.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.420]   He wasn't doing this in his home.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.120]   He wanted to publicly show everybody who he was.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.740]   And yet they continue to come and said, "We need signs."
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.320]   In John 6, verse 2, that's a passage where after two years of performing miracles, thousands
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   of people are now coming to him, thousands, because they're starting to be convinced he
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.600]   must be the Messiah.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.900]   He's the one that we've been waiting for.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.880]   So they packed up their bags and he went up to the hillside and they all went up with
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   him.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.060]   So that's 5,000 men, including women and children, possibly up to 20,000 people followed him
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.480]   up on the hill.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   And this is what he says.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.460]   This is before he performs the miracle of the bread and the fish.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.620]   John 6, 2, "A large crowd followed him because they saw the signs which he was performing
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.420]   on those who were sick."
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.420]   So they were convinced by these signs.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.540]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.060]   John chapter 6, 14, after he feeds the 5,000, they say, "Therefore, when the people saw
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.480]   the sign which he had performed, they said, 'This truly is the prophet who is to come
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.360]   into the world.'"
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:40.660]   So before the miracle of multiplying the bread and the fish, they said, "We came because
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.480]   clearly you show signs."
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.380]   After they ate the miraculous bread and fish, they said, "Clearly, if there was any doubt,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.860]   you have to be the Messiah."
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.940]   So they want to forcefully make him king because of the sign.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.180]   Well, Jesus and his disciples are tired.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.580]   They go to the other side of the sea.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.020]   20,000 people see that he's not there.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.140]   They pack up their bags and then they go look for him.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.060]   And then when they encounter Jesus, Jesus sees right through what they were doing.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.460]   And Jesus says in 626, "Jesus answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.820]   seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.'"
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.140]   In other words, you're coming to me even though you're saying that you clearly see the sign
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.020]   and we want you to be our king because we see the sign.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.700]   Jesus says, "You're not coming to me because you saw the sign.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.500]   You're coming to me because you ate bread and you want more."
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.100]   And the response in John 6 30, "So they said to him, 'Well, if what you are saying is true,
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.780]   if you are truly the bread, what sign do you do?'"
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.160]   And they just couldn't get over it.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.500]   He's performing sign after sign after sign after sign.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.200]   They came to him because they saw the sign.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.700]   They wanted him to be king because they saw the sign.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.620]   And yet at the end, he said, "Well, prove yourself.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.940]   Show us signs."
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.420]   In fact, Apostle Peter, when he is preaching in front of the same people who yelled out,
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:08.140]   "Crucify Jesus," in Acts chapter 2 22, he says, "Men of Israel, listen to these words.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:14.620]   Jesus of Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs, which
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.940]   God performed through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know."
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:25.900]   Peter, just in case anybody missed it, he said it was clear what he was doing.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.700]   Everything that he did and he performed proved who he said he was.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.420]   And yet as Apostle Paul was preaching the gospel, he said, "They kept on asking for
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.420]   signs."
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.260]   What were they missing?
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.460]   By their own admission, they said they saw the signs.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:47.260]   They came into Jerusalem after Lazarus was raised because they wanted to see the signs.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.980]   In fact, the signs were so clear, even the people who wanted to crucify Jesus could not
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.340]   deny the signs.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.860]   And yet as he was preaching the gospel, he says, "Well, we're not going to believe until
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.620]   you show us the sign."
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.860]   So what are we missing here?
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.140]   What does he mean that he wants signs?
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.060]   Well, you have to remember what the Israels were looking for.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.340]   They were God's covenant people and they thought that if they remained faithful to God, that
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.520]   they were going to be the superpower, that they were going to be Egypt, they were going
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.260]   to be Rome, they were going to be the Babylonians, but that never happened.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.820]   They experienced a brief period of success during King David and possibly Solomon, but
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.140]   rest of their history, if you've ever read the Old Testament, the rest of the history
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.740]   is Israel constantly falling into sin over and over again.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:42.460]   And eventually they get conquered by the Assyrians and then the Babylonians and then the Persians
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.760]   and then the Greeks and then the Romans.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.700]   So by the time Jesus comes, they had generation after generation after generation of being
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.580]   dominated by these superpowers.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:12:00.660]   So they thought if the Messiah comes, he's going to take vengeance upon their enemies,
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.540]   that he's going to overthrow the Roman government and they're going to be the superpower and
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.180]   they were going to be on top.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.500]   And that's why even the disciples, as Jesus was going to the cross, he kept on telling
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.060]   them, "I'm going to be beaten, crucified and be raised."
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.120]   Remember their response?
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.740]   They couldn't get that out of their head.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.580]   Well, who's going to be the Secretary of State?
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.340]   Who's going to be the Vice President?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.580]   Who are you going to appoint to the left or to the right?
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.100]   And even as Jesus was saying, "I'm coming to die for this world."
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.020]   And they said, "Well, when the Romans are taken over and we are the superpower, what's
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.220]   going to happen to us?"
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.520]   So you could see the hope that they had when they saw the signs that he was performing.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.740]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.940]   Who else can do what he is doing?
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.500]   And yet the problem that they had with Jesus was not what he was doing, but what he was
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.120]   saying.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.980]   The Sermon of the Mount in Matthew 5, 38-44, "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.800]   for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.820]   But I say to you, do not resist an evil person, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek,
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.020]   turn the other to him also."
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.780]   Now that sounds beautiful at church.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.940]   It sounds beautiful to sing about and tell other people that Jesus told us to turn the
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.460]   other cheek.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.440]   Tell that to somebody who's angry.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.540]   Tell that to somebody who's upset.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.900]   Turn the other cheek.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:37.540]   Again, it sounds great at church, but how many of you, when somebody wrongs you, your
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.300]   natural reaction is the other cheek?
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.140]   If somebody comes to you when you are wronged, let's say you're at a supermarket and somebody
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.300]   cuts in line, you know, it's a 30-minute line and they're tired of it and they cut right
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.140]   in front of you, do you say, "Well, thank you."
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.460]   Go even further up.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.280]   No, that's not our natural reaction.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   We want vengeance.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.540]   We're going to bump them with the cart, go in front of them, because it's wrong.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.180]   When you're wronged, our natural reaction isn't to turn the other cheek.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:16.180]   So imagine the Romans or the Jews had generations of this frustration, and they were waiting
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:23.340]   for the Messiah to come to galvanize the Israelites to prepare them to go into Jerusalem and conquer
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.820]   Rome.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.420]   And they've never ever come close to this.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.520]   This is the first time in generation after generation after generation, they have somebody
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.740]   who can literally just say to the storm, "Stop," and it stops.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.540]   That even if somebody dies, he says, "Be raised," and they are raised.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.020]   If there was any hope in their history, this was the first time.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.740]   First time Jesus walking into Jerusalem and say, "He's going to fulfill what we've been
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   waiting for."
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:15:01.220]   And yet, what he was doing and what he was saying didn't fit.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.720]   How can a man be so powerful just tell us to turn the other cheek?
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   He goes further than that.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.460]   If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.460]   You have to remember, this is not a period when people had a wardrobe.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.740]   An average person usually had one inner clothing and one outer clothing.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.580]   So basically he's saying if somebody asks for it, just give them all your clothes and
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.580]   walk around naked.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.020]   That's not practical.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.420]   He's basically saying don't resist them, give it to them.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.240]   Sounds beautiful at church, but it's impossible to practice, especially with somebody who's
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.260]   already angry, wanting vengeance.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.540]   Just turn the other cheek.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.180]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him to two.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.420]   You know why he says that, go one mile, go two?
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.740]   Because there was a Roman law.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.940]   By law, if the soldiers came into town and they had heavy armory and he get tired, he
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.520]   can just stop anybody.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.620]   So if they happen to be in Jerusalem walking around and here's this pregnant lady with
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:07.360]   two children, but he's tired, you take my sword, take my shield, and you walk with me
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.220]   for an hour, for one mile.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.700]   And by law, they had to do that.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.940]   So can you imagine the resentment that they had toward the Roman soldiers?
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.940]   Instead of saying, just give us some time, we're organizing.
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.980]   The zealots are going to organize, we're sharpening our knives, we're going to pretend like we're
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.420]   submitting, but when the time is right, we're going to get at them.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.420]   Don't worry about it.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:36.740]   Instead, he says, if he tells you to go one mile, go the extra mile.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:42.180]   Give to him who asks you and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.480]   You have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.240]   But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.120]   Not only did Jesus say this, he actually practiced this.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.020]   When he went into Jerusalem, remember, Peter was ready to fight.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.440]   When the soldiers came to take Jesus, Peter took out his sword.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.960]   Why not?
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.080]   Even though he's not a swordsman, Jesus walks on water.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.400]   Jesus can calm storms.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.500]   So if he's going to sit in Jesus' cabinet, when he comes into power, he better be courageous.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.240]   So he takes out his sword and he swings.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.380]   Jesus actually ends up rebuking him, puts the ear back on the guy that he cut.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.380]   And Jesus says, do you not know?
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:36.960]   Do you not know if I wanted to, I could send legions of angels to wipe these guys all out?
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.940]   As he is standing before Pilate, Pilate says, clearly what they're asking to do to crucify
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.800]   you is not fair.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.840]   You are not deserving of crucifixion.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.960]   Do you not know that I have the power to release you and give you life?
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.280]   Why do you not defend yourself?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.420]   But Jesus says to him in John 18, 36, my kingdom is not of this world.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.980]   If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting so that I would
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.660]   not be handed over to the Jews.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.180]   But as it is, my kingdom is not of this realm.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.780]   And he surrendered.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.500]   That's why the disciples were confused.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.340]   I think before they were scared, they were confused.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:28.020]   Why would this powerful Messiah not only tell them to give in, but not stand up for himself?
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.800]   These Romans again are taking the only hope that they had, and they're going to kill him,
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.620]   and he does nothing.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.340]   So as he is going to the cross, the disciples are following from a distance.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.580]   I don't think they were scared, they were confused.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.580]   Why would he do that?
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.820]   Because Jesus clearly told them, and he gave them the signs.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:57.260]   They were blind because they were so fixated on what they wanted the Messiah to be.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.020]   And so when he gave himself up, they hid.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.740]   Out of confusion, and now out of fear.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:11.340]   And that's why even when Jesus was being resurrected, Jesus clearly says, on the third day I will
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.260]   resurrect, on the third day I will resurrect.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.620]   But when Jesus resurrected, the disciples didn't even go to check.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:23.500]   Because what Jesus did by giving himself was so far from what they expected the Messiah
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.280]   to do, they forgot about everything and went home.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.280]   They didn't even check.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.980]   And then when the women came back and said he's not in the tomb, they didn't even believe
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.940]   it.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:42.140]   What they were rejecting was not simply Jesus, they were rejecting his kingdom.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.060]   And that's why even though they saw all these signs, it didn't fit the Messiah that they
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.020]   had in their head.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.980]   And that's why they kept on saying, so the sign that they want is not simply to turn
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.780]   turn bread and then, and then multiply it.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.940]   It wasn't simply for him to walk on the water, to do something with that.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:07.300]   If you have all that power, and if you're the Messiah, take vengeance upon Rome.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.260]   That's what they're saying, we want signs.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:18.780]   Think about how much what we do, and we miss Christ because he doesn't quite fit what we
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.820]   think he should be doing in our lives.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.740]   So we either walk away from him, or we keep our distance and we admire him from a distance,
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.100]   but he's not quite the Messiah that I want.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.500]   The Greeks wanted wisdom.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.580]   You have to understand the Greeks, wisdom basically was their religion.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.980]   They had more than 50 different schools of philosophies.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:48.420]   Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, Skeptics, Pythagoras, on and on and on.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.140]   And so their religion was their knowledge.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.380]   So they would come into the villages and they would set up shop, and then the Platos and
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.820]   the Stoics would sit there and they would debate each other.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.220]   And then people would basically come, and if you happen to have the greater argument,
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.100]   you would become a celebrity.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.660]   And if you're a celebrity, you would make the money.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:13.660]   And so at that time, it was the philosophers who were the entertainers.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.100]   Philosophers were the movie stars.
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.060]   They were the celebrities.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:23.100]   And so they're saying, if you want your religion to be better than ours, prove it.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.100]   Give us the knowledge.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:31.060]   Now, Apostle Paul could have easily, easily wiped them clean with his knowledge, because
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.700]   in Acts 22 verse 3, he says he was a direct disciple of Gamaliel.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.060]   Gamaliel was a top scholar of Israel.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:45.220]   In fact, Gamaliel is very well known outside of the Christian circle because of his scholarship.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.940]   Some believe that he may have become a Christian, but that's not for sure.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:53.100]   But for sure, it says, Apostle Paul was very, very highly educated.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:59.580]   So if he wanted to, you know, he could come into any village and just wipe them clean
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.500]   just with his knowledge.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.540]   In fact, in Acts chapter 26 verse 24, as Apostle Paul is in prison, he's standing before each
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.180]   of the leaders.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.960]   Instead of defending himself, he starts preaching the gospel about Jesus Christ.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:23.020]   So Governor Festus, recognizing who Apostle Paul says this, he says both Jews and Greeks,
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.620]   he says this in verse 24 of Acts 26, while Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.220]   said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.060]   Your great learning is driving you mad."
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:42.940]   So the governor of Jerusalem already knew about Paul, that he was very well educated.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.460]   But instead of using that knowledge to defend himself, he said, "You must have gone mad.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.460]   You just went too far."
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:54.340]   Apostle Paul, if he thought that the power was in knowledge, he could have wiped them
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.180]   clean.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.860]   If the power was just with the miracles, they could have went to each city and just performed
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.860]   miracles.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.700]   And I remember when the charismatic movement was sweeping the land, and I remember praying
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:11.020]   that God would give me the gift of healing for the purpose of evangelism.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.060]   And I say, "If I had the gift of healing, I would go to Angel Stadium, and when people
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.620]   come to get their peanuts and hot dogs, I would just slay people right there."
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.580]   Instead of every week like slaving over to like, "What does this mean?
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.580]   What is this text?
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.580]   What does it create?
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.580]   What's the syntax?"
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.460]   I just read a passage and just go out and just slay people.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.700]   And believe in Jesus, and if you don't, this is going to happen to you.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.700]   You know?
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:40.060]   Go to Dodger Stadium or go to some parade and knock people out, you know?
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.980]   If that's what was going to bring them to Christ, he said, "If that's what they needed,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.340]   the apostles could have easily done that."
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.740]   But he says, "They want science.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.740]   Greeks want wisdom."
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.540]   He said, "We preach Christ crucified."
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.620]   He said it was a stumbling block to the Jews.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.300]   The word stumbling basically means in Greek is skandalon.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.660]   It became scandalous.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:08.660]   That Christ crucified caused the Jews to stumble because the very Messiah that they were hoping
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.580]   and praying for, they themselves ended up rejecting.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.020]   And he was a chief cornerstone that they rejected, became the cornerstone that they absolutely
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.020]   needed to build Israel.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:26.300]   So they became, the gospel became a stumbling block, a skandalon to the Jews and foolishness
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.700]   to the world.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:34.860]   If you grew up in church, you probably may have forgotten or maybe if you don't, you
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.020]   know, take your time and evangelize and talk to non-Christians, just how foolish the gospel
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.740]   sounds.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   If you grew up in the church, you never really thought through.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.480]   You're just kind of like, "Oh yeah, Jesus loved me and died for me and I became a Christian
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   and that's great.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.020]   And one day when I die, I'm going to go to heaven."
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:58.700]   So you know the basics of the Christian faith, but you never seriously asked.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:04.900]   If I told you that I have a million dollars, right, and you guys know me, right, and I
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.580]   told you I have a million dollars and I'm just going to give it to you, the first person
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.860]   who stands up right now, I'll give you a million dollars.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.860]   You don't stand up.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   Why don't you stand up?
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.780]   It's a million dollars.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.460]   Because you know I don't have a million dollars.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.300]   You see in the car I drive, right, you know I don't have a million dollars, even though
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.740]   you trust me.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.860]   Imagine going down to just random people on the street and say, "You know what?
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.860]   You know I have a million dollars.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.100]   If you come to my house, I'll give it to you."
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.620]   How many people do you think will follow you because they believe you?
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.700]   It's hard to believe, right?
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.560]   It's hard to believe.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.100]   The message of the cross is mankind rebelled against God.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.840]   We're blaspheming His name.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.600]   The God of the universe who created us.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.500]   And instead of wiping us out, He has compassion.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.760]   And in order to save us from our own sin and our own rebellion, our own blasphemy, not
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.160]   only does He not condemn us, He sends His only begotten Son.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   Only begotten Son.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.840]   He has more than a million dollars.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:17.000]   Only begotten Son to take our place and the punishment that you and I deserve, that He
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.120]   took it upon Himself that if we believe Him that He will cleanse us of our sins and that
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.740]   we're going to be in eternity.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.760]   Now you're in the church, so you've heard it so many times, it just sounds like, "Oh,
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.120]   that's a great message."
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.600]   Listen as a non-Christian how ridiculous that sounds.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.960]   You want me to believe that?
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.600]   Really?
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.400]   God became man?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.320]   Now if I told you that God got angry with the world and He wants to wipe it out, that's
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   easier to believe.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.560]   Isn't that easier to believe?
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.960]   Right?
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:27:00.880]   All-powerful God, people who are rebelling against Him, and He chose to wipe us out?
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.680]   That makes more sense.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:10.280]   That God in the universe would give His most precious Son to die to redeem sinners?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.160]   And not only do you want us to believe that, you want us to put all our eggs in the same
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.000]   basket and go tell the world about this?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.600]   Are you serious?
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.920]   No wonder it's foolishness to the world.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.840]   It is foolishness to the world if you only know the surface of what happened.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:38.520]   And I think that's a big problem with a generation of Christians who are biblically illiterate
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.320]   because they don't understand.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.080]   And that's why they can't bear fruit.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.480]   Because when you talk to non-Christians, you can't explain.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.200]   It is foolishness.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:56.440]   And when the world desires power, it's like, "Yeah, I wish God did this."
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:03.480]   They said they asked for wisdom, the Jews asked for signs, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.960]   Power of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.360]   You know that power?
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.300]   You know when we think about power, right?
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.160]   Not all power is useful.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.960]   Power is only useful if it is directed toward the problem.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.280]   Just like, I don't know if you've ever tried to remove a tree.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.960]   You know, no matter how big it is, you can cut it all down, but the tree trunk, it's
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.280]   almost impossible to dig out by yourself, right?
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.160]   Especially the larger the trunk, the harder it is to take out.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.500]   So you actually need a tree trunk remover.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.140]   I don't know what the technical word is, but the tree trunk remover basically has a huge
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:43.080]   drill and you put it on top of the stump, and then it starts to drill.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   And what may have taken you a year to dig out by yourself and get all the roots, this
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.080]   thing does in minutes.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.440]   You just turn it on, you go, "puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh," and it comes and just wipes
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.400]   everything out, and then a tree trunk comes in little bits and pieces and it's gone.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:05.160]   But as powerful as that is, if you're trying to demolish a building, it's useless.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.520]   Because that power wasn't made for that.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.060]   Same thing with wisdom.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.400]   You can have a PhD in molecular science.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.240]   You can be a rocket scientist with several PhDs, but it's completely useless when you're
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.480]   trying to communicate with your wife and with your husband.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.080]   So no amount of knowledge is going to help you with that.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.840]   In fact, I remember years ago we had a pediatrician at our church, and he went to medical school,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.720]   had extra fellowship, and he was an expert in that field.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.040]   But they didn't have children, so when the wife first got pregnant, she was so frustrated
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.680]   because the doctor would never take any advice.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.560]   She's like, "You know, I do this for a living.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.800]   I'm the one who tell them about Lamas.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.760]   I'm the one who tell them about the birth cycle."
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.160]   And then so she's like, "Oh," she's so frustrated because she's like, "Don't worry about it.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   I got this.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.680]   I got a doctorate in this."
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.040]   And then they finally had a child.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.560]   And then about two months into raising this infant, I remember the husband and wife came
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.600]   to our home, and he sat there and his doctor was completely lost for words.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   Basically, he hasn't slept in two months.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.160]   And he was just staring out into space.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.720]   And at that time, we had four children in our home, and he looked at it and said, "How
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.800]   do you do this?"
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:27.120]   All that learning, he had head knowledge, but it was completely different once he had
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.560]   a child in his home.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.280]   He had all the right things to say until he actually had a child in his home, and he realized
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.320]   this was far different than what he imagined.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.600]   Obviously, that probably made him a better doctor, but all the knowledge in the world,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:46.400]   if it is not geared toward the problem that you need to solve, is useless.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.920]   It wasn't that Jesus was not performing signs.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.400]   It wasn't that there isn't knowledge and wisdom behind what he was doing, but the primary
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.500]   problem with mankind was not Rome.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.000]   The primary problem with mankind was not lack of knowledge.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.040]   The Bible says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.240]   The primary problem of mankind is mankind.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:17.120]   There's a lot of debate right now about socialism, about capitalism, about communism, but in
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:23.240]   the end, it's not the system, because no matter what kind of system you bring in, if the people
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.360]   in that system is corrupt, they're going to corrupt no matter what they do.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.240]   So if you believe that if you change the system, mankind is good, and if you change the system,
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.680]   they'll be able to do good things.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.800]   In the end, that's what communism really is.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.040]   Communism basically is mankind in and of itself is good.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:47.140]   It's the system that's corrupt that causes certain people to be rich and certain people
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   to be poor.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:54.320]   So if you take out the system and let mankind opportunity to be good to other human beings,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   then they'll be good.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.360]   They'll naturally share with one another, work hard so that the other people can benefit
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.640]   from their hard labor.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.960]   That's communism.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.640]   It has proven to not work.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.400]   Whatever your political view may be, I don't think any of you will disagree with me that
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.920]   people work harder when they benefit personally.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   I remember the first time I went to China in 1993, walking into a restaurant, and at
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.980]   that time, it was a pure communist system.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.320]   They got paid $5, $10 a month, no matter what they did, and I remember every time we walked
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.760]   in, they would be upset because they'd have to work.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.680]   They had to turn on the light.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.600]   They would come in and slam the chopsticks on our table.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.360]   What do you want?
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.160]   And then if we sat around talking a little bit longer than we should, they'd say, "Okay,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.320]   time to get out," and they'd shut the lights off.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.880]   They did the minimum that they had to do.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:59.000]   Again, whatever your political ideology is, I hope there's no communists here, but whatever
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.840]   political ideology is, I don't think anybody would disagree that we work harder when we
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   are more selfishly motivated, but in the end, it's not the system.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.440]   The Bible is not the system that's corrupt.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.640]   No matter what leader you put in there and no matter what system you put in, the corruption
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.160]   the Bible says is in our own heart.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.120]   We've fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:32.600]   Now, I remember years ago when Facebook first came out, there was a big issue about privacy,
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   right?
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.920]   And I was a little bit surprised that so many people were angry about the privacy setting
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   of Facebook.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.560]   It's like, "Oh, you know, like, we don't own it.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.920]   They own it, and they can access.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.680]   They do whatever they want with their information," and I remember surprised because I said, "When
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:55.280]   I posted things on Facebook, I was posting it on www, World Wide Web.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.400]   I never thought that that was going to be private."
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.440]   Maybe that's a generational thing that you put it on the internet.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.200]   I just assume it's not mine, or else I wouldn't put it up there, but I realize the younger
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.600]   generation is different, right?
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.340]   But why are you so concerned about your privacy?
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.400]   Why are you so concerned about your privacy?
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.640]   What if somebody had a million dollars that they just don't need, and they're looking
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.000]   the internet to find, you know, worthy people who are in need, and they want to give you
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.840]   some money, and you won't let them into your Facebook?
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.080]   Aren't you concerned about that?
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.880]   If you're in need, just put it out there.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:43.960]   It's like, "Hey, I need $100," and what if somebody wants to give it to you, but because
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:49.600]   of your privacy, Setti, you protect your identity, they can't come to ... Aren't you concerned
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   about that?
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   That you're going to miss out on the goodness of mankind?
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.640]   Probably not, right?
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.160]   No, we protect their privacy because we don't trust anybody.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.480]   Maybe there is one guy like that, but majority of the people, you're concerned that they're
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.000]   going to take whatever information you have, and they're going to be up to no good.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:23.040]   Let me ask you, is it harder to make friends when you're older or easier?
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.160]   It's much harder.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.960]   It's much easier to make friends when you're younger.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.440]   When you have a child, and you take a kid, and you throw them into the playground, they
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.680]   play with each other, and they're best friends next day.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.840]   "Yeah, I want to be your best friend."
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   "Me too."
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.920]   And then they grow up together.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.400]   That don't happen in your 30s, in your 40s.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   It's much harder.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   Why?
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.760]   Why is it harder to make friends when you're older?
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.160]   Because we don't trust people.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.360]   It's years of being burned and being disappointed.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.640]   I don't know anybody, they're older, and they're more open and generous.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.380]   They become more grizzled and more careful and more skeptical of people because we've
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:11.960]   all been burned because we've had enough time to experience mankind.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.720]   Look at the internet.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.880]   I mean, the technology that we have, I mean, the advancement of technology that made our
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   life easier.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.960]   I was just thinking the other day, like, how did we ever get anywhere without GPS?
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.920]   Remember, some of you guys, when we didn't have, we had to look up the map, and if you
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.440]   didn't have that map, you had to go by memory.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.000]   And I remember one time I was coming home from somewhere, and I was probably about five
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.320]   minutes away from home, and I didn't realize I was lost until 20 minutes later, it says,
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   "Welcome to San Bernardino."
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   And it's like, "Oh, my gosh, I've been going the wrong way for like 30 minutes."
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.400]   And I had to turn the car back around, go back home.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.720]   I was only five minutes away from home.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.320]   I was daydreaming, and then I just wasn't paying attention.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.820]   I was like, "But how do we get anywhere without GPS?"
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:03.520]   So all this advancement of mankind, and think about all the access that we have on the internet.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:09.320]   Any question that I have, I can say, "Google, when did Genghis Khan live?
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.760]   How many children did he have?
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.800]   Did he have any Christian influence?"
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.920]   Like, boom, right there, on the tip of your finger.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.720]   Well, all the advancement of technology and everything that we have, you know what the
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.480]   top 10 visited sites in the internet is?
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.680]   All porn sites.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   Top 10.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.720]   Top 10.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:40.200]   So all the technology, the things that we do is dictated because the biggest funds generating,
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.260]   money generating industry is pornography.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:51.740]   More than Netflix, more than Hollywood, more than NBA and NFL, it's pornography.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.000]   So the root problem of mankind is mankind himself.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.760]   And no matter how much we fix, no matter how many laws that we pass to taper the racism,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.040]   in the end, racism is not a system in and of itself.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.180]   It's the man in the system.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.960]   And that's what Jesus says that he came to deal with.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.440]   He can overthrow the Roman government.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:20.160]   He can give everybody a PhD in knowledge, but the root cause of the problem of mankind
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.000]   is mankind himself.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.080]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:32.640]   See, God had intended you and I to be in the presence of his glory and to give him worship.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:37.320]   There's a reason why Governor Newsom made entertainment essential.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.200]   While he said, you know, religious gatherings are not essential, entertainment is essential.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.660]   Because entertainment is a form of worship to a non-Christian.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.540]   You and I were made for worship because in the period that you and I are in, in darkness,
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.040]   people are depressed, they can't go to work, they're having financial problems.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:00.140]   But at least if you are entertained, you can forget for a period.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.520]   You can find peace for a period.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.380]   You can find joy for a period.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:10.760]   So it is a non-Christian's way of dealing with the problem of mankind to temporarily
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.840]   forget your problems.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.480]   And so they have declared it essential because they're not Christians.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   They don't understand.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.960]   But the very reason why you and I are here and all over the world celebrating the birth
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.760]   of Christ is because Christ came to deal with the central problem of mankind, is our own
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   sins.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.940]   It's because we have fallen short of God's glory.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:38.680]   Until we are restored back to his glory, we will always be trapped.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:44.760]   We will always be trapped seeking temporary glory in something else.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.800]   That's how we get so hooked on making celebrities and idols and movies.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.120]   In and of itself, they're not evil.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:00.400]   But mankind who does not recognize his primary problem will constantly go to temporary fixes
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.160]   for temporary life.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.600]   But Jesus said that he came to give life and give this life abundantly.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:11.160]   And until our eyes are open to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we will always
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.600]   be bound by whatever catches our attention.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.080]   But here's a problem.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.320]   We've fallen short of God's glory and mankind, because we do not see his glory, we cannot
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.840]   worship him.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.920]   That's why Christ came.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.440]   That's why Christ came, because he wanted to restore us back to his glory.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.540]   Hebrews chapter 1, 3 says, "He is the radiance of the glory and the exact representation
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.160]   of his nature."
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.520]   So he came in human form representing God's glory.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.280]   2 Corinthians 4, 6, "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' is the one who
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.080]   has shown in his own heart to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.000]   of Christ."
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.680]   Because we were separated from God's glory, Christ came to reflect his glory and then
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.400]   to bring us to him.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.440]   In John 17, 1, when Jesus was headed toward the cross, he says, "Father, the hour has
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.520]   come.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.540]   Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you."
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:23.560]   So Christ crucified is to magnify the glory of God and to cover us with his blood so that
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.080]   we may enter into his glory.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.720]   Because you and I, in our own sins, cannot stand before a holy God.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.800]   Because he is so pure.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's just like going to the nuclear bomb center.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.520]   It's just pure energy.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.280]   But that pure energy, if we're not protected, will kill us.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.720]   And that's what the Bible says.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.960]   A man in his sinful state cannot enter to see his glory.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.200]   And that's what's the dilemma of mankind, that you and I have been separated from the
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.160]   ultimate object of worship, the very reason why you and I were created.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:03.360]   And that's why Christ came in his power, in his wisdom, that he offered himself to cover
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:11.720]   us and to impute his righteousness on us so that we may enter his throne of grace with
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.880]   confidence.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.480]   And that's why the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is described.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.880]   A non-Christian is somebody who the enemy has blinded so that they do not see the glory
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.080]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.040]   But Christians are people who, covered by the blood of Christ, we are constantly gazing
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.040]   at his glory.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.760]   And we're living in eternity in worship.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.600]   Those of you who've never experienced true worship before God, if you're a sports fan,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.620]   I mean it's a crude analogy, but it's the closest thing that we can come to.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:52.260]   The euphoria that you experience when something beyond you is in your presence, you break
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:43:00.840]   out into worship, something beyond you, that's something that causes you to be awed.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.680]   If you're a fan of Lakers or baseball and they win the championship and you see the
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.240]   struggle and at the end when you are observing, you did nothing.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   What did you get out of that?
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.700]   They don't give you a free hat.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.600]   You don't get a stake of that team.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:22.240]   But you would spend hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars buying their clothing, identifying
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   with what?
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.000]   What do you get out of it?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.640]   Joy.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.720]   Life.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.880]   Fellowship with other people who feel the same.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.800]   Community.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.360]   Simply because you observed something magnificent before you.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.680]   There's a reason why people don't pay money to go see middle-aged men play basketball,
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.040]   because it's not glorious.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   So we get that kind of joy from watching sports.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.160]   Imagine what we fell from.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:05.120]   Imagine what He's trying to restore us back to when our eyes become open to the glory
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.600]   of our Father.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:16.920]   Greatest truth, greatest power, greatest love that you and I could possibly imagine in Christ.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.520]   That's the invitation of Christmas.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:27.600]   Christ came so that He can walk on earth, so that we can become a sympathetic high priest,
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.760]   and He made the invitation.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.800]   All who are weary and heavy laden, He says, "I will give you rest."
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:41.000]   Those of you who are moving around, seeking to find purpose in life, wanting something
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.800]   to give your life to, all of that may be because you've been separated from the author of life.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:58.680]   So, this Christmas, we celebrate not simply the miracle of God becoming man, but His sacrifice.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.600]   That He who knew no sin became sin, so that you and I may become the righteousness of
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   God.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.940]   And that same invitation that He gave 2,000 years ago is the same invitation that continues
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.440]   to be repeated until He comes.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.800]   If you confess your sins, He is faithful and just to forgive of all your unrighteousness.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:21.600]   If you would simply come before Him, acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of the blood
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.200]   of Christ to cover you, and He will open your eyes to what you have fallen from.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.280]   That He wants to restore you to worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:38.920]   So this morning, I encourage you that if any part of what's been said made any sense to
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:45.360]   you, to just come before God honestly and say, "Lord, I've fallen from You.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   Would You open my eyes?
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.320]   Lord, I'm a sinner.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.160]   I've been trying to fix my marriage.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.800]   I've been trying to fix the world.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.320]   I've been trying to fix my kids, but I recognize the greatest problem is me.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.520]   And the only power and the only wisdom that can change me is Christ crucified."
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.120]   So if you would just come before God honestly and say, "Lord, forgive me of my sins," He
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.200]   will forgive you.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.640]   So I pray, again, after the service, we'll have a place back, you know, where our outreach
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   team will be there and some of the pastors will be there to answer some of your questions.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.320]   So invite some of you who are interested in that to go there right after service and they'll
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.640]   give you the help that you need.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:34.080]   But the message of Christmas is not just for, again, non-Christians, it's for Christians.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:41.360]   If you've been at church all your life and you've, you acknowledge the power, but that
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.120]   power never affected you.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:50.400]   You've gained so much knowledge, but your eyes have never truly been open to the wisdom
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   of God.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.800]   That maybe today, maybe this Christmas season, take a step back and ask yourself, "Do I know
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.240]   this power?
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.880]   Do I know this wisdom of God?"
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.280]   So that this Christmas season will not just be a religious thing that we do and pass by,
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.200]   but to really fix our eyes upon Christ.
