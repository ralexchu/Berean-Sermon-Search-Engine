[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (silence)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hello everyone. Before we jump into our
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Pagan Bible study for today, let's take a moment to look before the Lord
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and ask for His grace and help, and really understand and apply
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   His commandments. Let's pray. Our God,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   we do thank you for your work. Thank God many times
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   we have worked in punishments and in corrections. The Lord we're so thankful
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   for your faith, knowing by the God that your scriptures continue
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   to examine and bless us, and it caused us to walk in that.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   To abide by your truth, it caused us to be sane,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   to grow into truth. And that's what we pray for, God,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   that we would grow to the measure of Christ, that God
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   we would be growing in both wisdom and understanding, but also that I'm being able
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to apply what you say. We thank you Lord that Christ can be praised.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Okay, so tonight, we're going
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   to be continuing our study of Ephesians in the passage this evening
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   from verse 15 through 21, which I entitled "Walk carefully
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and wisely." So let's take a moment to read
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   the paragraph, starting from verse 15.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   "Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   wise, making the most of your time, because it pays our
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   people. For then do not be foolish, but understand what the will
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   of the Lord is, and do not get drawn to the mind, but rather to the
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   spirit, speaking to one another
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   in a soft and gentle spiritual song, singing in a neat melody
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   with your heart to the Lord. Always be in thanks for all things in the
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Okay, well, let's briefly have a way of review.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We realize again that there has been such a repetition of the
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   admonishment to make sure that our pattern of life and the way that we walk
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   is God-like. And so, starting all the way back
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   in chapter 4, Paul challenges us, and you've heard the Gospel
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   lessons in all of this radical teaching, for you, you need to walk in a manner
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   worthy of this call. And he describes how our
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   walk should be characterized by humility, by love, by unity,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and more. In chapter 5, verse 1, the Scripture challenges us
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   to imitate God as his children, and to walk in love.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   In verse 8, we're challenged to walk as the children
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   of life, no longer partaking in deeds of darkness, but rather
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   exposing everything that we're doing to the truth.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And here, we're having this call, this command
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   for us to walk carefully, and to walk
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   carefully, and to walk quietly. Here, out of the message
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   we take a look at it, all these colors, what I've done for you is outline
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   the passage according to the commandments. So what do I mean
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   by that? There are main commandments within this passage,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and then there are, I guess you could say, supporting commandments, as you see.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And the way you differentiate is by taking a look at
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   what are the correct imperatives.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So here, as I read this, it says, "Be careful how you walk."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That is a standalone imperative. We're not going to stop there. It's a complete
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   sentence. He describes that walk by saying,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   "Not as unwise, but as wise." But if you take
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   "not as unwise, but as wise" by itself, it almost feels like an incomplete
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   thought. He continues by saying, in John 1,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   verse 17, the commandment should be, "that you do not walk foolishly,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   but understand what the will of the Lord is." And to summarize, I can say the second
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   main commandment is, "understand the will." Thirdly,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   he says, "Do not be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   This command, "be filled with the Spirit," obviously it's an important one,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   but there's a lot more to say about it. But you can clearly figure out one of the main
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   commandments. And then letter D, down in verse 21,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the subject of it. So in a simplified way,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "Walk carefully and walk wisely," I see as the main heading of the paragraph.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And then he says, "Understand God's will, but then be
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   "are walked," so being careful and wise, "be filled with the
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Spirit," almost. Commit yourself to it.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So we don't have to jot all of this down, but I just wanted to show you that
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   this passage uniquely was just full of commandments,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   one after another. And I saw a structure where
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   not every single commandment was just that other side of the road.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Rather, you saw four main ones, walked out of the first.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Let's take a moment then, and jump to commandment number one.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   "Walk carefully and wisely."
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   When you take a look at this commandment,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   it says, "Therefore be careful how you walk." And what we want
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   to observe is just that commandment, "Hey, be careful!"
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Now, if we just glance over it,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   we might think the other commandments are more important,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   we'll come back to them, because they're more consistent. But I think actually
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   it's good for us to take heed of this general, again, more broader commandment as well.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   There is an emphasis here.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I would like to show you a re-reading here. In the Greek instruction,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   it has a more, I guess, a weightier-ness,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   because the way that you would more literally read it is like this.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   "See then, accurately, how you walk."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   "See then, accurately, how you walk." So, the commandment,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "Be careful!" actually is several words. "See accurately
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and specifically." What we're talking about here is that
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   we hear the expectation for us to be willing to examine
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   everything that we're doing. That we have the ability to stop
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and be assessed, so to speak. And more so, we'll actually
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   assess ourselves. What we need to be doing is making sure that we are
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   paying attention to the way that we are doing and what we're doing. We should be willing to
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   ask the question and meditate on this. What happened?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Is there any part of me right now that I'm not paying attention to?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Am I being kind of careless
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   in the way that I'm approaching or whatever in my life?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And to meditate on this further, I have this question. What happens
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   if I'm not asking the question and self-evaluating and asking
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   the question, is what I am doing, why?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And I want us to take a moment to think about that.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   If in your home, whether you're working on a project,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   whether you're trying to fix something, whether you're trying to build and then you get
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   to the furniture and everything, if you're not careful, what ends up happening?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   A lot of times, what ends up happening is we hurt ourselves. We stub our own toes.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   We smash our thumbs. Or we hurt other people.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Let's take a moment to think about this.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   If we're not careful, what ends up happening is that we end up wasting our time.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   If we're not careful to build our furniture in a specific way, or
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   according to the instructions, you end up doing something and then you realize, like, "Oh!
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I missed that important part and now I gotta dismantle it."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Well, that is a fasting scripture. It warns us, if we're not paying careful attention,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   we're putting together something that will not last, that needs to be done
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   over again, or altogether scrapped, and it will not
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   have the potential to apply. What is that? That's called
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   "ending." That's called "wasting." What's more,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   in our day, if we're not careful right now, we can be
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   really messing up all of our priorities. What do I mean?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   There are so many different priorities in our lives.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   There are responsibilities for family, job,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   church, personal, and the responsibilities continue
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   to stack. And if we're not careful, what ends up happening is
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   the various priorities that God has given us get turned upside down.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The priorities that should be more spiritual, heavenly-like, more
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   important, get split. And the priorities
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   of the world, the priorities of this age, the priorities of next, whatever is
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   urgent, those things have to take place. I think this is a
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   big source of challenge for us, and for me too, personally.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I feel like God has been teaching this, as a layman,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   through people in our church, through fellowship, that sometimes if we're not careful,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   we definitely lose sight of what's most valuable, what's
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   most important. And I think this is the call that is most emphasized
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   in the starting sentence, you need to be careful. For example, to me,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   you know, I think everybody these days, everybody has lots of
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   messages to get through, everybody has lots of people to text, everybody has
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   lots on their plate. But again, if you're not careful, what ends up happening is
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   your goal gets distracted. There are times when literally
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   my goal was, you know what, I just need to make sure by the end of the day, my box
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   is empty, and I respond to everything. Or,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   on the flip side, if I have a bunch of tasks, you know what my goal is, just to make sure that all of those things
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   get checked off. But then if I'm not being careful,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I have to end up answering to God, essentially. Like, God, did I ever do
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   what you wanted of me? Is everything
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   equally the same? And I've been learning this, and I've been being challenged by this.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Just from my own trying to get things done,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   just thinking about how effective,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   how am I totally actually accomplishing God's
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   plan? How am I totally
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   actually tending to the need of the day? What kind of fruit is this
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   bearing? These are all very important questions. Why?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Because He says, "When you do that, you are then a need-wise person."
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So we hear this challenge and this demand. Scripture says
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   it all the time. Watch your writing and doctrine closely.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Many other passages tell you, I'm not going to read this whole thing, but if you look at
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   1 Corinthians chapter 2, the Apostle Paul talks a lot about there's a
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   wisdom of the world, and there's a wisdom of God. And what needs to happen is that
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Christians need to understand the value of things. And he says,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   there are things in our lives that the world might see that this is important, and that's
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   important. But he says, the spiritual things are spiritually
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   great, I believe, because we have the mind of God.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So, I spent a lot of time on this first one because it was very
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   tight. We need to be paying much closer attention to what we are
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   doing. In line with that,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Apostle Paul challenges us with this next phrase,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   where he says, "Make the most of your time." And so the second
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   commandment you see is, "Redeem the time."
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Now, by way of observation, this phrase begins with the hardest
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   part. It is the I-N-G, ongoing statement.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Making the most of your time. And so if you notice, I indented it
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   to show you that it is a second or supporting
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   idea of how we're supposed to be careful in our lives and our day.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Now, by way of observation, I want to highlight this idea of
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   making the most of our time. It is literally translated
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   as offering you a "binding it all."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   So, if you look at this term in, let's say,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   other literature or other passages of Scripture, the idea is
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   redemption, purchase. So actually, it is used in Christ
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   when it talks about the dogmas that Christ fully purchased
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   us. And what's more, in other literature, it is used
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   of an individual by a slave in order to set them free.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It is also used in moments when an individual
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   is sold into whatever it may be, they buy it all out.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And so I want you to take a moment to think about that when it comes
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   to our use of time. This kind
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   of mentality then for us is to maximize that time.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   This kind of mentality for us is to make sure that we try to squeeze every ounce
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   of benefit from whatever we're doing. And now that's not to
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   say, obviously, and you guys can discuss this in your groups, and I didn't think about
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   it a minute ago, that's not to say that you have to be a machine and every
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   waiting moment you should be doing nothing but free-preying abandonment.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I wish you could! But there are moments of rest,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   there are moments of enjoying the company of your loved ones,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   there's a lot more. But let's take a moment to think
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   about this idea because Scripture challenges us to do this on
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   an everyday basis. Here, in Colossians, conduct yourself
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   willingly towards the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So here, we kind of get the sense of what you talk about.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   That when we have opportunity, are we actually making the most of it?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Or again, are we just passing it first and we hold it?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   This is just a challenge for all of us. How good would it be to be attached
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   to the opportunity that we have? Intentionality.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   In Scripture, it tells us when we're speaking words, those words should be both
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   seasoned with salt and it should actually point beneath the knee of the hour.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Wow. What a challenge. Intentional thinking.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Careful attention. All that good stuff.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   What's more, relations. So then, while we have opportunity, let us
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   do good to all people, especially to those who are a household of the
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Savior. There it is, it builds in with the Scripture
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   definition for us. That as we have this chance to do good,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   we need to be making sure that there is good being.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And I wanted to say, there's another observation we can highlight.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Notice how when we go back to the passage, it says making the most of the time.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That term for time doesn't just mean hours and minutes.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Time is a set period of time. A lot of times,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   translated, it is a season. So in this moment, so to speak,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   we need to make sure we understand that we have
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   obviously a limited amount, a set amount.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Scripture says it's not like we have time for every single thing, but you need to make sure
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   that you understand we have but a moment. And Scripture
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   challenged us to see that we are transient beings. We are
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   like papers and we need to be active in knowing that
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   no, we don't have time to do every single thing, every single hobby that we would like to do.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I just want to share another personal opinion.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   A lot of people know that I just love learning stuff.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I'm not like necessarily a super ambitious person,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   but nonetheless, I just love learning. I like
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   knowing how to do things. And so if you ask the question about
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   my gift to them, some people have said, "You're kind of like a jack of all trades."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And the other part of it is, "Absolutely, I'm not an alpha male."
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   But it's true. If you have all these different
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   interests, you can't be a bachelor. So what's funny is
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   in terms of sports, when some people are like, "Let's get
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   people to play tennis." I play tennis. I have tennis practice.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   I played tennis in high school. I played soccer. I'm a soccer ball.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   I even have a badminton set at home that I haven't touched in two years.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Pretty much every sport you can think of, I have to be a good player. I have softball gloves.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I have a baseball bat. I have a baseball glove that I haven't touched in a month.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And I say that not to brag, I actually say that
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   mostly to shame, because the majority of people don't get touched in like years.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Now what's really interesting about this is I just want to say, I mean,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   is it wrong to have lots of hobbies? No.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But I want you to think about this. And we're talking about the idea that you don't
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   have time for this. And so those people who just
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   want to go out and experience everything, and think about this even for parenting,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   "Do I want my child to experience everything that they possibly can?"
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And the answer is yes. I want them to know what it's like to go
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   here and there and experience this sport, and that sport, and this sport.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I'm talking about instruments. I'm going right now, like you, you know, we got a piano
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   from somebody. Someone gave us ukuleles, and now we have that. We have
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   a guitar at home. We have a flute. It's crazy to me.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   But now we have this privilege of having anything that we have.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And yet we realize, "No, we don't have three hours
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   for the guitar, three hours for the flute, three hours for the car,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   get me started on that. I have pieces of car that I don't have
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   ever installed yet." I'm sure some of us would like that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And I want you to think about that, because King Solomon
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   widely said, "All of man." He says, "I planted my vineyards
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I had to be dumb. I grew this, grew that. I bought this, bought that.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I had slaves, I had servants. I had just about everything." In the end, man,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   what was it? And you know what's really interesting?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I was going to compare it, because I was going to give a thirdly suggestion.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Don't have 50 million hobbies. Have one that you're good at.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Be good at it. And I was going to give that admonishment,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   but that too is actually worthy of it. And in the end,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   you know what's really cool right now? People right now
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   on the internet, on Facebook, and thank you to those who coordinated it,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   they're using their skill, garnering interest,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   and using that as a means to support issues, to support
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   the evaluator, to support these causes of adoption.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   That's a fun one. Excellent stuff.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Way to add intentionality to what you're doing. That's a two-thumbs up right there.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   That was great stuff. Is it always that we have to do that
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   all the time, do everything? Probably not. But should we be thinking about that?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Absolutely yes. What a great challenge that has been
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   an admonishment for us. That we take heed
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   of the fact that our time is absolutely up. That we don't have
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   all the time. And what's more, the rationale that this could give is actually
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   that... I'm sorry.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   The days are actually even.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Now I want you guys to, in your group, discuss what does it mean that the days are even?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And how does that challenge the way that we think about what opportunities
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   are actually happening? It is a very interesting
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   and weird, I guess you could say,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   discussion that Satan has instilled, I think, in our generation.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Opportunities before you. You've got
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   all the opportunity in the world. The answer is yes and no.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   The answer is it's a balance game. We are absolutely privileged
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   that we have such great, incredible freedoms like never before.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   The fact of the matter is you're not. You have limited time,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   limited opportunity, and you have to make sure you are not squandering
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   and wasting your time. We're going to achieve this in response
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   to us and to the Mass. Let's move forward to
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   commandment number three.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Commandment number three says, "So then, don't be fooled,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   but understand who the will of the Lord is."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   The commandment here, I just want to highlight that, obviously
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   is not just to study the will and get to know
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   the will, but the idea is that you would know the will and why
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   you need to know the will. The wise
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   individual understands God's intent,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   what God is up to. Here's the way I like to put it. The wise
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   individual knows what is pleasing to God. We talked about this
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   in previous weeks. The wise individual, the individual who's walking
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   carefully, understands this pleases the Lord.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   You should be able to say, "This is what God is honored by.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   This is what God is pleased by." And you should be able to say, "I kind of
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   got that stuff." These are the things that a good son
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   understands. Father's Day is coming up soon.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   If you're thinking about a gift for your father, the first question
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   you should be asking is, "What does he like?"
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   If you're sitting there like, "I have a good handbook,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   and now we have a problem. We have a bigger problem
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   than I need to buy a gift. Your problem is more so than I need to get
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   rid of my problem." That's the point here.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I would like to make another observation that
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   the commandment is very clear. Do not be foolish. That part we've already talked about.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Foolish individuals do not walk carefully, do not be attentive, do not be
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   accurate, do not be precise,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   do not be a point in the knee. You just walk.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Just walk and be kind of careless. Here is that
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I don't understand what the rule is. My personal belief
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   of where this applies, and I've been thinking about this recently, is in men.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Now a lot of people will say this, "You know what the key to marriage is?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Good communication." When you have bad communication, that's when things go south.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   So people talk about how men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   We talk two different alien languages. That didn't mean so.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Men just communicate way different. We're not expressive. Sometimes
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   we don't dig into meaning of words and all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And sometimes we do. We just have a different way of expressing ourselves.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Okay. I don't think that's true. Because I've literally
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   seen people speak two different languages and yet still
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   come together. You know what actually one of the main
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   keys of self-awareness is? When individuals know
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   what they need to adopt. They know their role.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   They know what they're supposed to do because they know this dishonors
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   the role. You know what's super frustrating? When an individual has no idea
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   what we just got and they just automatically assume, "Whatever makes me
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   happy because the thoughts are just going to do whatever makes me happy." Do you know how much that
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   ruins any institution? Not just marriage. Churches.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Basketball teams. Jobs. Business teams. Whatever they need.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   When an individual has no idea of their God-given
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   role or objective, all of a sudden
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   it's all messed up. All of a sudden, when you go to a team
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   it does not feel like God. And so what's more
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   worse than that is not only an individual who does not feel like he's a God, but maybe
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   an individual who knows what he's a God, but just doesn't disobey.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I think scripture is very, very clear.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   One of the most foolish things you can do is know that
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I am a God and this is me. And that's what this idea
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   of wisdom begins with. You're a God. When you acknowledge
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   this authority and move to a place
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that's a place. But when all the hearts are dug, like, "Now
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I've got to do this right," that's when actually the biggest frustration happens.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   So he says here, "Don't be fooled. Understand
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   I do the will of the Lord."
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Okay. Next commandment.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   It is, "Be filled with
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   the Spirit." Commandment number four, "Be filled with the Spirit."
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Now, I apologize, because of time we're not going to be able
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to get into every single element of this passage. But again, I trust that
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   you guys have done your own observation, done your own question. I'm just going to
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   highlight it. The first thing I want to highlight is clearly we make this observation
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   that there is a contrast here between
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   being drunk off of wine and described as dissipation.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And then in contrast to that "with," "be filled with the Spirit."
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And you have to ask this question then, I ask
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   this question, "Why do people drink so much?" But the other question really is, "How
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   does Scripture view drunkenness and dissipation?" That summary
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   stated, "This is dissipation." What does that mean? Those are some observations
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that we need to have. And in order to answer that question,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I definitely think that we have to take a moment to just meditate on it. What is it
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   about getting drunk that this world thinks is so cool?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   What is it about getting drunk that this world thinks it's so awesome?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Like, when people think about
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   partying, wedding celebration, when you get a hang
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   celebration, when they think about birthdays, when they think about St. Patrick's
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Day, pretty much any and every celebration
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   you can think of, this world thinks, "Let's get drunk. Let's get alcohol."
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Why? Well, someone can say, "You know what? It just feels
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   great." Okay? Other people
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   might say, "Well, this just brings us together."
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It's like a little joke. Other people might say, "That
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   just brings in that community joy. We're celebrating."
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And then you realize, "Oh, that's weird." Because some people use it
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   when they're sad, when they're depressed, when they want to escape the pain of this
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   world, they drink it away. So, that's weird.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   You have individuals who love the world, and they think it's
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   amazing, and that's what they drink. You have individuals who hate the world, and all the
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   biases and all the rules of the world that they drink, and they're like, "That's
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   a waste." And what's really interesting is when the word dissipates,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   if you look up the definition,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   the immediate definition is "extravagant squandering."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   You're going to hear me say that. It says, "This is dissipation."
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   You're just getting off on one. The definition of dissipation,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   you know, when you think about water dissipating, you think about it in an accurate way,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   but the actual definition that's more literal is "extravagant
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   squandering." And so this term is used
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   theologically and more, I guess, metaphorically, like that
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   codical sign. The one who just spends much. Perhaps
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   you could think of the rich kid. The rich kid whose father owns
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   a lot of stuff, and so as a brat, he wants it, and he wants to go spend it.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And he spends it on all kinds of vices to his own gain. He is
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   easily under the influences and flattery of others. He's given to
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   temptation, and he surrounds himself with spending free to his
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   lust and appetite. It's debauchery. It's
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   this incredible manner of living that has so
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   won him. These are just some of the things that the theological
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   dictionary has about this term. "Extravagant."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   When you think about this term, you have individuals who turn to
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   alcohol as a means to feel like they're
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   full. As a means to feel like maybe the feeling
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   of joy. Turning to it as a means to feel like
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   whatever it is, the psychology of a rich child
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   who feels like they have all the resources in the world in
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   is a choice. Scripture says those who care
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   in terms of that as a means of their joy, as a means of their pleasure,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   as a means of their escape, as a means of anything
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   need to be turned to in the spirit of God,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   who lives in His very presence.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   We don't have to overcomplicate what it means to be filled
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   with the Spirit. To be filled with the Spirit means
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   we have, just like a child has his blessings in the Father, so we have
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   our blessings in the Father. We have His power, His wisdom, His purpose, His truth.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   In Ephesians, we're talking about we have every
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   blessing in the Father, so we bless Him.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   We're not talking about any kind of mystical greater measure
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   of the Spirit, we're talking about the very presence of God.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Now what the Scripture says, by way of observation,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   is that when we are filled with the Spirit, we are going to be
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   what Peter speaks of as an observation. Being filled with the Spirit
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   is described by an ongoing overflow of speech
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and song of the Holy Spirit. So,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   the heading should be overflow
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   of joy and thanksgiving.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   The previous commandment is to be filled with the Spirit,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   underneath that is overflow of joy and thanksgiving.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   So speaking to one another in song and in spiritual song, singing
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   and making melody with your heart to the Lord. Always
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is God,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   even in the Father. Think about this as fruits, a description
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   of what it means to be filled with the Spirit. So, if you have questions about what does it really mean
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   to be filled with the Spirit, are we talking about being empowered to do great works?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Are we talking about being filled with the Spirit to do miracles? Are we talking about
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   some kind of, you know, "guess what" scene? Well, here specifically,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   you're filled with the Spirit is described as an ongoing overflow
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   of joy and gratitude.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   So, this is an overflow of joy and gratitude.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That's the way it is.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Last, B, commandment number six,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   that is, "and be subject to one another in the fear of
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   anything."
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I'm going to talk about how commandment number six, humble yourself.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Humble yourself. If we're thinking about the logic of
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   being careful, being wise, we completely get all the
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   things that we're talking about so far. A quick way to do that
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   is to think about your needs. We need to make sure that we're giving people
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   time. We need to make sure that we understand how to live. We need to make sure
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   that we are living this overflowing of joy and gratitude.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   What is very, very character and very, very wonderful
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   is humility. Right? All of those
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   to me make sense. If you're wise, if you understand,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   if you're living in reality, you should be the most
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   joyful and thankful person. Right? You should be the
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   person who is in time. You should be the person who is
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   in the gospel, the truth, the impact, and the wisdom
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   of God is hitting us because we recognize His presence. All of
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   those to me make sense, especially to the public.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   To be able to subject ourselves to the fear
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   of Christ. The idea is because we have
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   an understanding of Christ, His authority, His power,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   His mercy, His kindness, and our reverence for Christ
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   rises in knowledge. The most
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   wise application of that is we are really
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   able to subject ourselves. Humble ourselves. Even before
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   people are humble. I want you to think about this in your head.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   I don't think you would be as
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   nobody's like that in our service.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I go to God and I'm like, "You know, I'm in it. You make sure you
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   manage it for me." We're not going to say that to God directly.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Does that mean I'm not right? But God says
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   if I talk to my brother in my life,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I'm still actually fighting with God.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   He's in the present. He's watching.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And if you've ever, let's say for example, you were the
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   greatest basketball player to ever live
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   in your presence, two rookies going into the
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   sit-down, fighting each other about defense, watching the picture there.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Because you're there, that little victory,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   that kind of competitive edge, that kind of egging each other, that kind of
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   mocking each other, it's annoying to watch
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   because you still see how foolish they are over what you've done.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You're going to talk about who was great in front of you. So I want you to think
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   about that in the presence of God. When we are
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   frightened, God's looking at us like, "Wow, who wants to be blind?"
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   You must not have seen. And if you're sitting there
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   thinking, "Well, I'm the best," God's looking at us like, "Wow, you're lying."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   If we're competing with other people thinking like, "Oh, I'm better than that person."
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   He looks at me and he deserves the credit for this. God's looking at us
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and thinking, "You have quite the problem."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   "Well, I've got all the foot seating in your room, Thomas. I do just as few as the mountains above."
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   When we flex in front of our mirror,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   don't look, don't mention it. Our world is so small
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   we think of the few. Only when we step outside
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   do we realize, "I'm not that few."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   See, our view of Christ, our experience
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   with the Lord, empowers us to be humble with each other.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   To submit ourselves to being with other people.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Realize, we don't deserve much.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   We're not much, right? And more importantly, it also modernizes us.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   "I realize I'm the greatest."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   "Actually, I realize I'm the least."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   "There's nothing. Please don't even look at me."
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   "You're doing a lot of shaming."
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   "Thanks be to God, I'm less, he's greater."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   "That's all that matters." "There is no jockeying for position between me and my brother."
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   "When I see God, there's nothing else."
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   "That to us is a great grace."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   "When we exercise our penitentiality, it's a great grace."
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   So by the way, we realize
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   being filled with the knowledge of God, seeing
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   the world of God's commandments, it causes us to be
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   wiser and more brave on the other side. It helps us to
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   avoid the foolishness of speaking in English.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   The foolishness of speaking in the broader
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   morality of seeing life as it is.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Let's take a moment.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Heavenly Father,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   God, we hear your time. We want to hear it.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   We realize that sometimes we do so much
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   in our own time, and we get more of it because
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   it's so fixated on making
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   sure that our priorities are good. Sometimes
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   we don't realize God, God, you might have a tendency to hurt ourselves
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   or others. I ask God that you can
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   see more accurately what is
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   spiritual. What is of greater importance? What is your priority?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Heavenly Father, you have told us. You have told us
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   all this while. We have to be part of
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   care, of humility, of heart for union,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and I pray that God will guide us in life.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   We thank you. God bless you.
