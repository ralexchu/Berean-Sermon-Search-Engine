[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.740]   Welcome to Berean Community Church Online.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.140]   This is our fifth week
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.740]   that we are having service together online.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.140]   Hopefully it won't be too long
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.820]   that we're able to see everybody in person.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.940]   We only have one announcement
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.140]   before we get to something more important.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.820]   But next Sunday, I think it was at 1.30,
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.700]   we have a Zoom meeting for the church.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.940]   It is not a mandatory meeting,
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.380]   but there are some things that we want to inform.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   Initially, we thought we were gonna
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.540]   just take some time for Q&A,
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.180]   but there are some things logistically
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.740]   that we want the church to know about,
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.880]   and so we're gonna be having a meeting then.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.860]   So again, next Sunday,
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.340]   just like we did a couple weeks ago,
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.900]   next Sunday after the service at around 1.30,
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.100]   we'll have an all-church meeting, whoever is available
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.620]   at that time.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.740]   Let's get to the important stuff, okay?
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.920]   We had some birthdays,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.420]   and that I forgot to mention.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.140]   Again, I know some of these birthdays are repeated,
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.960]   but I got the timing wrong.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.740]   So Connor Kim, happy birthday.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.940]   Miles Park had a birthday.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.500]   He's not gonna understand, but happy birthday.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.980]   Emmett Lim, happy birthday.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.700]   Justin Kim, happy birthday.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.780]   Mary Mobley, happy birthday.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.820]   And then Andrew Kim, letters are your friends.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.400]   Okay, happy birthday, Andrew.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.660]   We have some people who are extra specially good last week.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.740]   We have Carol Cho, said you wanted a purple lollipop.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.200]   Here it is for you waiting, okay, Carol?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.340]   And then Cadence, you're gonna have to step up your game.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.300]   Daniel Lim, happy birthday.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.060]   Hesi did a great job.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.260]   Oh, not your birthday, but Daniel did a great job
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.100]   last week paying attention.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.900]   Hesi did a great job.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.500]   Obi did okay.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.280]   Phoebe and Jedi, good enough, all right?
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.140]   So keep up the good work, guys,
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.060]   and participate in worship and help your parents out.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.620]   And so hopefully we'll have another great week.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.180]   Let me pray for us before we get into the offering time.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.340]   Heavenly Father, we praise you
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.940]   and thank you for your goodness.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:02.660]   We pray, Father God, that even though this may not be
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.780]   the ideal situation that we desire,
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.540]   we ask, Lord, that you would help us to focus our attention
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.040]   in our homes, with our families, or whether we are alone.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.700]   We pray, Father God, that your word and your spirit
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.900]   would cause us to fellowship together as one.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.220]   Help us, Lord God, to worship you in spirit and in truth,
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.860]   whether at this time we are tired or discouraged,
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.660]   whether we are encouraged.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.940]   Whatever situation that we may be,
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.500]   help us, Lord God, to meet you.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.420]   And even in our giving, Father,
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.780]   may it be an act of worship that we give you,
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.060]   not simply out of obligation.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.560]   May it be multiplied for your use, especially now.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.780]   So we pray, Father God, that you would ordain this time
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.620]   that you have given us.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.660]   (silence)

[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:32.720]   - All right, good morning.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.600]   The text that we're gonna be looking at this morning
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.880]   is John chapter eight.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.500]   We're gonna be going through parts of chapter seven
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.480]   and chapter eight.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.280]   So I encourage you to keep your Bibles open to those texts.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.920]   But this morning I'm gonna be reading
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.180]   from chapter eight, verse 12, before we get started.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.960]   Then Jesus again spoke to them saying,
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.080]   "I am the light of the world.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.640]   He who follows me will not walk in darkness,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.800]   but will have the light of life."
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.640]   Let's pray.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.480]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would ordain these words.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.320]   May it go forth and not return until it has accomplished
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.880]   the purpose that you have ordained.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.280]   We ask Lord God that you give us soft hearts,
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.320]   open ears, a willing spirit, Lord God,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.800]   to listen and to obey.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.960]   Open our eyes, Lord, that we may understand.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.560]   And I desire to continue to seek you, Father God,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.240]   longing to hear from you and only you.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.740]   We pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:41.840]   All right, so now it's already been five weeks
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.140]   and we're hoping that at the end of maybe a week or two
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.780]   that we'll get some news from the government
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.480]   and that social distancing and all that stuff
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.000]   will probably be in place,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.160]   but maybe the shutdown will begin to ease.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.880]   And I know many of you who are still working
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.520]   and not able to enjoy a lot of the things
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.960]   that we had before,
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.080]   that we're looking to go back to our normal life.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.840]   And as I mentioned at the beginning of this,
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.640]   I think it's a good opportunity for us to reflect
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.120]   what is normal life?
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.660]   What are the things that we miss
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.440]   that if it does open back up, what will we do?
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.860]   Maybe hang out with our friends, go to a restaurant,
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.720]   maybe get back to certain things that we enjoy doing
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.380]   in larger numbers, come back to church.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.280]   What is normal?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.200]   In fact, this is the exact thing
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.060]   that Jesus was trying to address with these I Am statements.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.600]   When Jesus said the seven I Am statements,
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.620]   the emphasis on the I Am statements
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.120]   is not that he is the bread of life
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.640]   or he's the light of the world,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.280]   he's the resurrection and the life.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.100]   It really is the I Am statement
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.060]   because it is the I Am statement that connects him
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.660]   to the I Am God of Yahweh of the Old Testament.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.100]   So if we read this like any other sentence,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.760]   it was a I Am this and I Am that,
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.820]   we missed the whole point of this
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.300]   because as I said in the beginning of this,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.160]   in the Greek composition of this word I Am,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.180]   it is the two to be statements back to back
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.300]   that connects this to the I Am statement of God
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.860]   when he introduces himself to Moses and he says I Am.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.220]   So the Jews clearly understood when Jesus was saying this
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.340]   that he was saying that he is connected to
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.940]   or he is God himself.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.780]   But what's different about the I Am statements
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.160]   in the New Testament is that Jesus was actually teaching
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.780]   the I Am application to our lives.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.080]   So every one of these I Am statements is trying to correct
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.100]   what became normal to the Jewish community.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.100]   Much of it was a misunderstanding of who the Messiah was.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.820]   They were expecting Jesus or the Messiah to come
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.020]   and he was going to feed them, take care of them,
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.340]   he was going to lead them,
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.180]   and each one of these I Am statements are stated
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.960]   in a particular historical context.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.220]   He didn't have a curriculum of seven I Am statements
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.020]   and decided that this is something that he needs to teach
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.860]   the seminary students so they can have this knowledge.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.140]   Each one of these I Am statements are given
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.180]   in a specific context that they had a misunderstanding
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.340]   or expectation of what they thought the Messiah
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.220]   was going to be and Jesus was correcting them,
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.380]   a correct understanding of the I Am
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.780]   is that he is the bread of life, that he is the light,
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.540]   he is the door, he is the shepherd.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.020]   And so if you remember,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.020]   we've gone through two I Am statements already.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.700]   We have the I Am the bread of life
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.300]   and the context in which he says that
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.060]   is after he feeds the 5,000
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.500]   and they're looking for more bread
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.400]   and Jesus says I Am the bread of life.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.020]   Last week we talked about in the resurrection,
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.580]   Jesus says I Am the resurrection and the life.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.900]   He says that in the context of raising Lazarus
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.900]   because they wanted him to live.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.060]   And so in that context he says no,
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.820]   it is not just because he has breath,
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.160]   he says I Am the resurrection and the life.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.540]   So today's statement, I mean we've already gone through two,
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.660]   this is actually the third,
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.860]   but out of the seven, this is the second,
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.340]   out of the seven statement where he says
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.540]   I Am the light of the world.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.620]   It is also within a specific historical context.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.220]   He wasn't just saying this out of the blue into the air.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.500]   If you look at chapter seven,
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.300]   again I'm not gonna turn there,
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.260]   but if you look at chapter seven,
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.620]   he says this in the context at the end of
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   one of the Jewish's seven major feasts.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.860]   In fact it happens to happen
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.700]   at the very end of their calendar.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.780]   The beginning of their calendar starts with the Passover
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.960]   and then the seventh and the last of the festivals
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.580]   was called the Feast of Booths.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.180]   Some of your translations may have Feast of Tabernacles
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.980]   and it was the same.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.820]   They consider this probably the biggest of their ceremonies.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.020]   And we would naturally think that
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.220]   it may have been the Passover, you know.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.760]   But the Jews celebrated this in a big way
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.060]   because it was connected to two specific things
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.900]   that was going on.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.860]   One, it was the celebration at the end of the harvest.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.420]   So you can kind of think of it as their Thanksgiving.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.540]   But after the harvest, they would collect all the fruits
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.760]   and all the bounty that they had from the harvest
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.400]   and they would take that and then all throughout the week,
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.380]   they would have these big festivals.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.780]   They would have families gather together
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.940]   and have these huge festivals.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.540]   And so it was like a Thanksgiving
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.980]   and this lasted for about eight days.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.380]   And during these eight days,
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.900]   one of the things that they did was
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.780]   they would set out a temporary booth
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.920]   and what we would consider like a tent.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.300]   And the reason why they did that
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.340]   was to remember God's deliverance of Israel
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.760]   and how God led them through the desert for 40 years.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.900]   So if you remember, the Passover was to celebrate
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.660]   how God protected them over the angel of death
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.180]   and led them out of Israel or led them out of Egypt.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.860]   The Feast of Booth was a celebration
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.340]   of how God led them in the desert for 40 years
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.620]   and protected them.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.540]   So they would live in tents for those eight days,
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.980]   having these large festivals,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.420]   enjoying the bounty of their harvest.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.940]   And at the end of the eighth day,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.860]   again, they would have a ceremony to remember
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.400]   that God is the one who delivered them.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.340]   So Jesus is saying, I am the light of the world
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.280]   in the context of them celebrating the Feast of Booths.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.620]   And the reason why this is so significant
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.940]   is because one of the main things,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.060]   main things that they did in this ceremony
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.820]   was that they set up at the temple,
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.640]   a 75 foot, like a lamp, four of them.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.540]   And so the priest would climb this up and light this
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.780]   and it would be going for eight days.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.380]   And so it would light up the whole temple.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.980]   And the purpose of this lighting was to remember
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.220]   that while they were in the desert,
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.220]   during the day, the cloud would be with them
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.860]   and God's presence would be with them.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.580]   And whenever the cloud would move,
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.580]   they would move with the cloud.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.360]   But at night, there would be this fire, right?
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.180]   And the fire would lead them in the darkness in the desert.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.980]   And so wherever the fire moved, they would move.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.960]   So they would light this torch to remind the nation of Israel
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.560]   that this is how God led them.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.840]   And that torch, every time they saw it,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.980]   would remind them that the Messiah was going to come
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.580]   and they would also be led,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.500]   like the fire led them through the desert.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.660]   So it was at that ceremony, looking at that lamp,
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.460]   that Jesus is telling the nation of Israel,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.540]   I am that light.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.980]   I am the Messiah.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:54.260]   But you'll be interested if you read the rest of chapter eight.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.460]   Remember, we looked at chapter six
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.840]   and it starts out with them wanting to make Jesus king.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.400]   Well, chapter eight begins with people
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   kind of questioning him.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.980]   In the middle of the chapter, chapter eight, verse 31,
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.280]   he says, "Many of the Jews believed him."
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.860]   And so he's talking to Jews who have believed him
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.120]   in the context of him saying, I am the light.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.200]   He says, "If you abide in me, you shall know the truth
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.320]   and the truth shall set you free."
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   And then he has this encounter with these Jews
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.000]   who believed him.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.040]   And at the end of the chapter, it says,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.320]   they wanted to kill him.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.040]   So we see in the first, in chapter six,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.320]   they want to make him king.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.200]   And then chapter 666, because of what he says,
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.960]   they wanted to leave.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.560]   Chapter eight, Jesus says he's the light of the world.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.160]   And as a result of what he says,
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.080]   at the end of the chapter, they want to kill him.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.540]   So Jesus is correcting something about their belief
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.440]   about the Messiah that was skewed.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.080]   So whatever it is that you were thinking was normal
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.280]   was unbiblical, wasn't correct.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.720]   So Jesus says that he has come to bring true light.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.840]   So what we want to do this morning
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.440]   is to look at three aspects of what this light represents.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.960]   What did Jesus mean and how did they understand it?
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.480]   And what does the Bible teach us about that?
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   So the way I phrase it so that it could be easier
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.540]   to follow along in these three ways,
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.600]   what does the darkness represent in light of the light?
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.760]   Okay, so the first one.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.160]   So if you're looking at the outline,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.120]   those of you who are at home,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.740]   darkness represents ignorance
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.800]   as light represents revelation.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.920]   Darkness represents ignorance
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.600]   as light represents revelation.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.320]   All throughout the scripture,
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.000]   it is stated that the reason why the Israelites
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.560]   were straying from God is because they did not know him.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.420]   Isaiah 5:13, therefore my people go into exile
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.180]   for their lack of knowledge.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:58.220]   Hosea 4, 6, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.140]   As Christ was hanging on the cross,
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.060]   he cries out to his father, said,
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.440]   "Father, forgive them,
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.520]   "for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.420]   In other words, they were completely blind.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.780]   Whatever it was that they thought that they saw was wrong.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.100]   They were looking in the darkness.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.700]   So when Jesus says he is the light,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.980]   he's basically saying is,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.580]   I came to open your eyes to see the truth.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.720]   To cause us to see, to shed light on what is truth.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.260]   In John 1:9, it says,
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.240]   "There was a true light which was coming into the world,
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.300]   "which enlightens every man."
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.040]   So in other words, when he says to the Jews,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.280]   I am the light of the world,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.940]   he's telling them that everything that I'm telling you
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.220]   is true.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.220]   I came to bring you truth.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.400]   Which many of them would have been offended by,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.580]   because all this time the Jews thought
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.500]   that they had the truth.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.060]   They had the Old Testament.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.740]   They had the prophets.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.040]   They had all their experiences.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.580]   They had all these festivals.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.060]   So when Jesus shows up and says,
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.280]   no, I am the truth,
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.020]   and he was basically telling them that they're blind.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.640]   So if you look at the encounter that Jesus has with them,
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.420]   they're very offended by what he says.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.020]   So it wasn't just a, I am the light of the world.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.020]   You know, it's like, oh, okay, you're light,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.020]   we're light, we're all light.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.740]   They knew exactly what he was saying.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.460]   2 Corinthians 4, 6, it says,
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.460]   "For God who said, let light shine out of darkness,
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.340]   "is the one who has shown in our hearts
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.700]   "to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.180]   "in the face of Christ."
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.640]   The primary thing that they were ignorant about
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.480]   was God himself.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.900]   And he says, Jesus says, the reason why he came
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.700]   was to shed light of his glory.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:55.420]   The Bible tells us that people who do not follow Christ,
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.140]   people who are not Christians,
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.860]   it's because the God of this age, Satan,
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.880]   has blinded the mind of the unbeliever
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.320]   so they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.860]   So in other words, he says a non-Christian
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.980]   is somebody who remains blind.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.300]   A Christian is one whose eyes have been open
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.820]   to the truth.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.140]   And so because we saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.700]   we saw God's glory, we are changed.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.340]   And that's exactly what Jesus means
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.020]   when he says, I am the light.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.100]   I have come to turn on the light so that you may see.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.920]   Well, how did Jesus do that?
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.280]   Which is really interesting because,
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.900]   remember I told you in the Feast of Booths,
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.340]   for eight days they would set up a tent,
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.900]   like a temporary shelter,
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.180]   where they would sleep outside of their home,
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.740]   remembering how God led them through the desert.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.860]   What Jesus has described in John chapter 114,
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.120]   the word became flesh, and he says dwelt among us.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.760]   The word for dwelt here literally means to pitch a tent.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.980]   Jesus Christ came and he pitched a tent among us.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:10.920]   And so one of the primary aspects of this festival
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.740]   was to live in their tents,
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.880]   and these tents represented God's presence,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.820]   how God delivered them in the midst
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.460]   of being lost in the desert.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.260]   When Jesus came, turned on the light,
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.600]   he pitched the tent among us,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.460]   and he says we saw his glory,
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.180]   glory as of the only begotten from the Father,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.620]   full of grace and truth.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:38.740]   So first and foremost, what he means by him being the light,
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.140]   that he came and he pitched a tent among us,
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.420]   so that we may open our eyes and to see the glory.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.880]   Because the Bible describes all of mankind
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.380]   as falling short of that glory,
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.260]   and we could not by ourselves reach that glory,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.580]   so what Jesus did was he came to us,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.000]   and turned the light on,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.040]   so that we may again see that glory.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.460]   And that's a distinction between somebody
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.200]   who is changed and not changed.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.060]   Somebody who's just a churchgoer,
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.500]   somebody who grew up in the church,
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.780]   somebody who's culturally Christian,
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.860]   versus somebody who is born again,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.460]   completely radically changed forever.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.940]   It's not a distinction between somebody
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.760]   who goes to church, memorizes scripture,
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.320]   was raised in a Christian family, who leads.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.260]   The distinction between a Christian and non-Christian
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.900]   is somebody whose eyes have been opened
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.100]   by the light and the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.460]   In John 14, eight through nine,
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.220]   Philip says to Jesus, "Lord, show us the Father,
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.720]   "and it is enough for us."
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.060]   Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you,
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.860]   "and yet you have not come to know me, Philip?
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.700]   "He who has seen me has seen the Father.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.900]   "How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.740]   In other words, Jesus was saying exactly
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.900]   what the rest of scripture says.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.620]   He came to reveal God.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.300]   Hebrews 4, one, three.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.900]   He's the radiance of his glory
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.340]   and the exact representation of his nature, God's nature,
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.820]   and upholds all things by the word of his power.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:16.100]   You know, in Acts chapter 17, 26 through 29,
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:21.100]   when Paul was introducing God and Christ to the Athenians,
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.660]   this is how he described it.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.620]   He said, "He made from one man every nation of mankind
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.300]   "to live on all the face of the earth,
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.940]   "having determined their appointed times
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.660]   "and the boundaries of their habitation,
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.300]   "that they would seek God."
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.060]   In other words, God has put boundaries,
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.340]   and God has done all these things in creation
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.540]   for the purpose of his creation
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.420]   to look at these things and say, "Who is this?
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.540]   "Who did this?"
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.860]   And that they would seek God,
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.180]   if perhaps they might grow for him and find him.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.100]   Though he is not far from each one of us,
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.620]   for in him we live and move and exist.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.500]   As even some of your own poets have said,
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.740]   "For we also are his children."
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.020]   Christ came, turned on the light,
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:16.020]   and by seeing him would initiate in us
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.300]   a desire to have more, to continue to seek.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   And that's why Jesus says in Matthew 7, 7,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.460]   "Ask and it will be given to you,
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.500]   "seek and you will find,
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.740]   "knock and it will be opened to you."
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.980]   You know, before we met Christ, right,
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.180]   and some of you guys may be able to relate to that,
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.620]   but I remember the day that I met Christ,
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.420]   everything that I didn't understand
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.120]   all of a sudden made sense.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.120]   You know, it was almost kind of like
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.580]   if you woke up in the middle of the night
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.940]   and you were at a strange house,
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.700]   and you're trying to figure out what everything looks like,
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.500]   so you're touching the dining room table for the first time,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.680]   you're going to the kitchen,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.100]   but imagine if you had no reference for what they were,
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.380]   and you were only seeing things through your touch,
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:59.860]   and your eyes just weren't working,
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.740]   because your eyes are meant to work with light.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.780]   But without light, you're using your senses
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.820]   to figure out everything else.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.660]   So imagine if your whole life was like that,
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.500]   you were blind, and you were looking through life
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.380]   through your hands, your senses, your smell,
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.660]   then all of a sudden, you are gifted with sight.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.180]   Light gets turned on, and everything that you were touching,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.700]   that you kind of had a sense for, but you didn't fully see,
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.620]   imagine what that would feel like.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:35.080]   Well, every Christian, whether it happened gradually,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.900]   whether it happened all of a sudden, like it did for me,
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.460]   knows exactly what I'm talking about,
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.160]   because that's exactly how life felt.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.840]   The moment I met Christ,
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.980]   everything that I was trying to figure out,
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.900]   why am I the way I am, why are my parents the way they are,
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.500]   why did we come to the US, why are we this,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.780]   and why is my dad that?
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.780]   And all of these questions, all of a sudden, made sense.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.580]   God did this.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.420]   That was God's purpose.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.180]   God was doing this for this reason.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:11.340]   See, that's what the Bible says, what Christ does.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.300]   When he turns on the light,
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:17.700]   all of a sudden, we see things through his light.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.980]   That's what it says in Psalm 36, verse seven.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.140]   In your light, we see light.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:29.140]   Until our eyes are opened by the author of light,
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.980]   God himself, Christ,
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.140]   everything that we're trying to figure out,
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.620]   everything that we're trying to figure out
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.300]   is like in darkness, using these senses.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.620]   It's almost like you have eyes, but you're not using it,
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.900]   because our sin has blinded us.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.420]   So the first thing that the Bible says
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.460]   about who Jesus is, I am the light,
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.340]   it means he came to open our eyes, open our eyes.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.140]   So when our eyes are open,
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.300]   the world no longer looks the same.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.740]   What makes us happy, it's just not the same.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.660]   What causes security is not the same.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.860]   What is normal is no longer the same.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.380]   And I think the benefit now for us
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.300]   to have the whole world flipped upside down
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.480]   is a good opportunity for us to take a step back
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.440]   and ask ourselves, what is normal as a Christian?
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.520]   Through the lens of his light,
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.640]   now that we see everything,
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.240]   what is it that we consider normal?
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.680]   What is it that we want to get back to?
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.960]   Is that truly normal?
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.840]   Or is that part of going astray?
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.480]   And that's the first meaning, what Jesus meant.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.760]   I am the light.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.440]   Not only for us, but for the whole world.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   Secondly, darkness represents sinfulness,
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.840]   as light represents righteousness.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.400]   Darkness represents sinfulness,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.360]   as light represents righteousness.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.520]   The ignorance wasn't simply because they weren't taught.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.740]   The Bible says that ignorance happened
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.940]   as a result of their moral failure.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.840]   Romans chapter one, 21, 23.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.640]   "For even though they knew God,
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.960]   "they did not honor him as God or give thanks,
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.300]   "but they became futile in their speculations,
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.720]   "and their foolish hearts were darkened,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.820]   "professing to be wise, they became fools,
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.120]   "and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.540]   "for an image in the form of corruptible man
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.580]   "and of the birds of the four-footed animals
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.240]   "and crawling creatures."
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.040]   Do you notice how he says, they profess to be wise,
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.440]   but they became fools?
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.880]   It wasn't that because they were blind
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.640]   that they began to be immoral.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.660]   The Bible says, because they were immoral,
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.160]   they began to become foolish.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:52.360]   You know, from years of doing ministry and counseling
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.540]   and teaching the Bible and talking to people,
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.460]   you know, I've talked to so many people
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.440]   who are at one point on fire for God,
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.740]   and then there's certain events that happen in their life,
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.620]   and they get caught in sin,
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.080]   and then they begin to embrace their sin,
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.120]   and they begin to fall out.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.400]   And one of the first things that I noticed,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.080]   and it doesn't happen to every single person,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.920]   but it happens enough where it's predictable.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.680]   One of the first things that happens
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.120]   when an individual begins to embrace their sin
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.580]   is that they begin to become atheists.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.000]   Well, what changed?
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.740]   How did somebody who was on fire for God
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.760]   and at one point talking about giving their life
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.280]   and becoming a missionary,
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.400]   and then they get caught up in sin,
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.040]   and they're unwilling to let go of that sin
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.580]   or to admit it as sin, and all of a sudden,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.540]   they say, "I don't know if God exists."
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.740]   It wasn't an intellectual problem.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.960]   It wasn't because people didn't answer their questions.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.280]   Just like it says in Romans,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.840]   when we allow ourselves to go into darkness,
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.760]   we cause ourself to be blind.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.280]   See, in John chapter eight, 31 to 33,
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.520]   Jesus has this encounter.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.880]   He says, "I am the light of the world," right?
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.100]   And the Jews get offended.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.200]   It's like, "Well, what authority do you have?"
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.340]   And he goes back and forth, and he says,
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.140]   "My authority comes from the witness of God,
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.520]   "myself, and the Holy Spirit."
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.960]   And he goes back and forth,
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.640]   and some of them get offended, and they leave,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.360]   but in verse 31, it says, "Some of them believed."
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.200]   Verse 31.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.440]   So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed him.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.920]   Jesus says, "I am the light of the world,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.720]   "and some of them believed him.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.360]   "If you continue in my word,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.000]   "then you are truly disciples of mine,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.920]   "and you will know the truth,
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.120]   "and the truth will make you free."
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:50.420]   Now, you wouldn't think there was anything controversial,
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.260]   at least in that statement.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.740]   If you heard, "Jesus is the light of the world,
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.240]   "he just said he was God,
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.900]   "that he's the light that they've been waiting for,
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.940]   "that the reason why they lit that temple up
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.660]   "every year for hundreds of years."
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.380]   He says, "I am that light."
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.780]   You would think Jews who were able to believe that,
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:14.260]   that what he says here is really innocuous.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.820]   He said, "If you believe I am the light,"
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.100]   he said, "Well, if you continue my words,
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:19.940]   "you will know the truth,
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.360]   "the truth shall set you free,
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.220]   "but that word set you free triggered them."
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.460]   They got upset by that.
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.320]   They didn't get upset by Jesus saying, "I am the light."
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.420]   They got upset because he said, "You will be set free,"
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.660]   because it was personal.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.020]   Now he was pointing to them,
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.580]   saying that, "You need to be set free."
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.100]   So these Jews who believed him
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.660]   have another encounter with Christ in verse 31 and on.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.960]   And he said, "How can we be set,
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.160]   "we don't need to be set free, Abraham is our father,
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.580]   "we've never been slaves,"
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.620]   because they were offended,
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.000]   because Jesus just told them that you need to be set free.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.140]   Back and forth that they go,
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.820]   and then Jesus ultimately calls them out in verse 44,
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.800]   he said, "You do not know me
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.500]   "because you do not know my father,
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.600]   "and your father is the devil."
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:13.040]   I mean, that's a long way to go from verse 31
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.840]   saying the Jews who believed him,
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.280]   and then saying, "Your father's the devil,"
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.500]   and then in verse 59, it says,
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.000]   "Therefore they picked up stones to throw at him,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.120]   "but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple."
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.420]   So people who believed in him
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.580]   was okay with the statement, "I am the light of the world,"
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.220]   but when he pointed out that you need to be set free,
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.780]   they got offended,
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.700]   and those same people wanted to stone him and kill him.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:49.300]   You see, people who have embraced the darkness,
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.780]   embraced their sin, doesn't want the light to be turned on.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.380]   You know, just like imagine if you're three in the morning,
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.580]   and somebody comes into your room
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.040]   and just flips the light on, right?
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.500]   You're gonna be angry.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.420]   Why'd you turn the light on?
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.540]   I want to sleep.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.740]   But if you need to wake up at seven o'clock,
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.700]   and you have an appointment,
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.140]   or you need to go to work, and you're late,
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.180]   and somebody flips the light switch on,
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.100]   you would thank them because you need that light,
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.580]   'cause you need to get out of bed.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:17.500]   That's exactly how it's described, John chapter three,
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.820]   19 to 21.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.740]   "This is the judgment that the light has come into the world
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:25.420]   "and men love darkness rather than the light,
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.860]   "for their deeds were evil.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.160]   "For everyone who does evil hates the light,
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.960]   "and does not come to the light,
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.340]   "for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.600]   "But he who practices the truth comes to light
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.840]   "so that his deeds may be manifested
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.140]   "as having been wrought in God."
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.840]   That's why an individual who embraces his sin,
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.540]   whether it is sexual immorality,
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.540]   whether it is his own pride,
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.420]   whether it is bitterness and hatred,
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:59.020]   they don't want to be exposed to the light.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.160]   They want to be where it is dim, and darker the better.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:09.880]   The scripture makes it absolutely crystal clear
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.740]   in 1 John 1, six through seven.
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.700]   "If we say that we have fellowship with him,
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.660]   "and yet walk in darkness,
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.380]   "we lie and do not practice the truth.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.080]   "But if we walk in light, as he himself is in the light,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.880]   "we have fellowship with one another,
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.520]   "as the blood of Jesus, his son,
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.000]   "cleanses us from all sin."
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.280]   See, Jesus came to not only open our eyes
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.800]   to see the glory of God,
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.920]   but in his light, once we see his light,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.200]   only then we can see all things.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.040]   But not only that, he came to flip the switch on,
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.520]   to turn the light onto darkness because of men's sin.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.560]   Remember, the whole purpose of Old Testament history
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.540]   and the law was to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.640]   Because until they recognize the filthiness of the sin
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.280]   that is inside of each one of us,
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.100]   there is no need for a savior.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:08.000]   Jesus didn't come primarily to feed the hungry.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.340]   Jesus didn't primarily come to change our economy
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:12.820]   so that we can have a comfortable life,
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:17.060]   or get rid of crime, or make the country more prosperous.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.000]   To get rid of pestilence.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.240]   His primary purpose right now
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.080]   is not to get rid of pestilence
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.220]   so that we can go back to our normal life.
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.280]   That's not his primary purpose.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.480]   His primary purpose in human history
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.980]   is to turn the light on.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.560]   And sometimes, pestilence may serve that purpose.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.280]   Sometimes, hardship.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.020]   Sometimes, excruciating pain.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.940]   Causes us to see things that we would not have seen.
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:50.800]   God turns the light on so that we can see clearly.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.440]   Because until we recognize sin as sin,
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.280]   we will never be able to recognize Christ as the light.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.980]   See, 1 Timothy 6, 15-16, it says,
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:04.040]   he who is blessed and only sovereign,
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.360]   the king of kings and lord and lords,
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.560]   who alone possesses immortality
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.460]   and dwells in unapproachable light,
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.380]   whom no man has seen or can see,
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.240]   to him be honor and eternal dominion, amen.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.880]   Christ dwells in unapproachable light.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.940]   Until our eyes become open,
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.480]   until he turns on the light,
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.980]   we are not able to approach him.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.240]   And that's why, when he says he is the light of the world,
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.520]   it's to show the glory of God,
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.940]   and in light of that, to show our sins.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.240]   See, a Christian is not a Christian
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.680]   who only repents at the beginning of conversion.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.120]   A Christian is a Christian because
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.540]   he continues to recognize his sin.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.280]   And he continues to repent,
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.780]   because he recognizes the filth.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.380]   You don't recognize the filth only in the beginning.
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:03.800]   He continues to, that's what sanctification is,
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.440]   is to move us along from the filth
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.280]   that we were okay with in the darkness,
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.200]   because when we didn't have sight,
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.920]   we didn't know how filthy the couch was,
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.880]   we didn't know how filthy the television was,
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.520]   we didn't recognize how filthy our hands were,
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.020]   until the light got turned on.
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.200]   And in light of his light, all of a sudden,
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.800]   the world doesn't look the same.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:29.120]   So for a Christian, for a Christian who has seen
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.000]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.840]   and the world seems just as appealing
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.740]   as it did before you met Christ,
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:41.160]   there is a big doubt to whether
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.720]   that light was ever turned on.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.380]   Because the light gets turned on,
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.840]   and when we see things as God sees it,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.500]   God doesn't see this world as beautiful.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.140]   This is a world that is in rebellion.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.380]   This is a world that is waiting for judgment.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.960]   This is a world that can only be saved
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.720]   by the blood of Christ, and we are only waiting.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.740]   We are only waiting as the creation is groaning
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.360]   for the sons of men to be revealed,
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.880]   that he may redeem us.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.720]   For somebody who claims to have seen the light,
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.040]   and has eyes have been opened,
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   and never really recognizes the filth that is around us,
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.240]   is inconsistent with what the Bible tells us.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.360]   There is temptation.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.440]   There's times we can drift.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.680]   But when there is no distinction
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.800]   between before opening their eyes
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.720]   and after opening their eyes, at least in practice,
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.520]   it is inconsistent, and it's exactly
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.520]   as 1 John 1, 6, 7 says.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.760]   John is not saying, hey, you should work harder.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.560]   He's just stating a matter of fact.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:55.240]   You can't say that your relationship
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.560]   with God has been restored
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.760]   while you're continuing to live in darkness,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.640]   because God is in light,
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.100]   and those who walk with him will also be in the light.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.920]   Third and final thing that darkness represents.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.760]   Darkness represents lostness,
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.840]   as light represents direction.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:21.080]   As I mentioned, the light for the Feast of Tabernacles,
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.380]   or Feast of Booths, was a constant reminder to them.
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.480]   During the day, the clouds directed them.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.500]   At night, the pillar of fire would go before them.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.880]   So if the pillar of fire would stop,
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.800]   they would stop and camp out.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.060]   But when it started to move, they would take up and move,
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.240]   because they didn't have navigation.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.400]   In fact, they didn't even know where they were going,
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.800]   because where they were supposed to go,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.280]   because of their sin, God would make them wander.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.640]   So it wasn't like, we're headed to the promised land,
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.360]   so if you make this direct line, we're gonna get there.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.400]   God said, no, you're gonna wander for 40 years.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.960]   So those 40 years,
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.220]   they were absolutely dependent upon this light.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.920]   And if you remember, the Israelites,
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.300]   even though they were large in number,
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.600]   they had families and children.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.000]   This was not, these were not soldiers
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.200]   who were marching in the desert.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.160]   These are families with small children.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.280]   You know, typically, right,
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.560]   I don't know if you've ever noticed,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.600]   but typically, if you're out in the market,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.880]   or if you're trying to cross the street,
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.780]   and if you have small children with you,
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.320]   most people tend to be a bit more generous,
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.540]   you know, a little bit more gracious,
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.600]   because we're vulnerable
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.320]   when we have small children with us.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.720]   You can't go into battle.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.880]   And so we're not talking about soldiers,
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.960]   men who are marching out in the desert.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   We're talking about a large group of community
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.240]   with small children and grandparents walking around.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.680]   So if any army wanted to come and attack them,
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.420]   they were completely vulnerable.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.860]   And this is out in the desert.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:49.120]   So it wasn't like there were food lying around everywhere.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.540]   In fact, one of their primary complaints was
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.320]   they didn't have enough food, they didn't have enough water.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.520]   They were constantly complaining about that.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.680]   So what God told them was,
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.540]   if I tell you to move, you move.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.900]   If I tell you to sit, you sit.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.500]   If I tell you to go, you go.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.520]   If I tell you to camp, you camp.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.060]   So for 40 years, they were doing basic training.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.440]   And in the basic training,
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.920]   all they had to do was look at that fire and say,
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.760]   do what that fire tells you to do.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.880]   Go, stop, march.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.280]   And so that fire not only represented the presence of God,
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.660]   it was their salvation.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.160]   'Cause as long as they obeyed,
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.300]   as long as they went where God told them to go,
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.400]   God took care of them.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   So when Jesus says, "I am the light,"
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.680]   he wasn't simply saying, "I'm gonna open your eyes
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.760]   "so that you may see the glory of God."
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.320]   He wasn't just saying that your sins are revealed,
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.880]   so now you need to repent.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.640]   He was telling them to follow him.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.600]   In Psalm 18, 28 through 29,
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.960]   "For you light my lamp,
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.260]   "the Lord my God illumines my darkness.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:02.300]   "For by you, I can run upon a troop,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.760]   "and by my God, I can leap over a wall."
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.440]   In other words, when God lights my path,
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.840]   I can run upon a troop.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.920]   In other words, we're no longer vulnerable
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.120]   because God is with me.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.720]   I'm no longer weak because God is with me.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.200]   'Cause my strength does not depend upon chariots or horses,
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.800]   but on the spirit of God.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.040]   And so that's what Jesus meant.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.800]   He said, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.440]   "No one comes to the Father but through me."
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.080]   And that's basically what he was saying.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.320]   When he says, "I am the light of the world,"
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.200]   and he says, "He who follows me
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.020]   "will not walk in darkness,
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.560]   "but will have the light of life."
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.840]   In fact, the early church,
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.000]   today, if we wanna identify somebody who follows Christ,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.880]   we would say they're Christians, right?
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.520]   Or maybe more specific, evangelical Christians.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.320]   Or even now, that's been watered down,
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.800]   so now we have fundamental Christians.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.240]   And we have more words that are added
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.400]   to describe a genuine born-again Christian.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.120]   The early church, you know what the first description
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.880]   of the early church was?
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.240]   It wasn't Christian.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.080]   The word Christian was actually given to Christians
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.160]   in a derogatory way.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.280]   It means little Christ.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.520]   Non-Christians gave that to Christians,
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.720]   saying, "Those little Christ,
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.200]   "those people who are following, they're little Christ."
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.800]   But the actual word that the Christians used
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.880]   to describe themselves is mentioned in Acts chapter 9 too.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.600]   You know what that was?
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.480]   The way.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.600]   That's how they refer to themselves to the other Christians.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.160]   Are you part of the way?
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.760]   The way.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.600]   Because Jesus said, "I am the light,"
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.920]   and they understood what he meant by that.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.680]   What he meant was to follow me.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.220]   See, Christ turned on the light,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.480]   not simply for us to admire him.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.160]   We have people all around the world
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.680]   who say they're Christians, but all they are are admirers.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.880]   They admire the love of Christ.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.520]   They admire his grace.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.880]   They admire Christians.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.720]   They might admire the church.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.880]   They admire their friendship.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.580]   They admire the generosity.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.640]   But they do not follow him.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.560]   See, early Christians knew exactly what Jesus meant
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.360]   when he says, "I am the light."
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.120]   "He who follows me," he said, "will not walk in darkness."
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.440]   So this is a Christianity is a call,
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.920]   not only to see the glory of God,
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.560]   not only to repent of our sins, but then to follow.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.900]   You notice at the Great Commission,
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.520]   he says to go make disciples,
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.040]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.120]   Son, and Holy Spirit, and then what?
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.760]   Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.280]   It doesn't end with baptism.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.040]   Baptism is the beginning.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.720]   The purpose of why we go to proclaim the gospel
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.660]   is so that non-Christians can open their eyes
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.560]   and see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.200]   And when that happens,
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.720]   baptism is a symbol of repentance.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.400]   They are buried with Christ in their old life,
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.800]   and then they're resurrected with Christ.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.760]   So that's repentance.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.540]   The third part of it is to teach them
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.040]   to follow Jesus Christ.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.880]   And that's what he meant.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.080]   He says, "I am the light that they may follow."
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.160]   Matthew 4:19, when he called the disciples,
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.020]   and he said to them, "Follow me,
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:39.560]   "and I will make you fishers of men."
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.480]   That's the first thing he told his disciples when he said,
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.040]   he didn't just say, "Come after me,
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.620]   "and I will show you miracles.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.360]   "I'm gonna reveal to you who I am
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.420]   "so that you can marvel at who I am."
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.680]   He said, "No, follow me
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.240]   "so that I can make you fishers of men."
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   John 12, 26, "If anyone serves me, he must follow me.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.460]   "And where I am, there my servant will be also.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.600]   "If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him."
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.240]   Finally, in John 10, 27, he says,
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.160]   "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.760]   "and they follow me."
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.300]   He doesn't say, "My sheep hear my voice,
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.760]   "and they acknowledge me."
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.960]   He doesn't say, "My sheep hear my voice,
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.560]   "and they admire me."
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.320]   He said, "My sheep, they hear my voice,
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.920]   "and then they follow me."
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.960]   That we go where he goes.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.200]   We stop where he stops.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.600]   We speak where he speaks.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.400]   We are bold when he is bold.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.480]   We are gentle when he is gentle.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.160]   You know what's interesting is,
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.760]   if you look at the Bible dictionary,
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.960]   they'll give you all the synonyms
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.920]   and the antonyms of this word in the Greek.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.760]   I thought it was interesting
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.920]   because when you looked at all the antonyms
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.640]   of this word follow, the opposites
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.800]   of this word follow in Greek,
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.080]   it's interesting 'cause it says
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.860]   the opposite of this word to follow is to lead.
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.360]   One of the words is lead.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.560]   Obviously, you can't be following if you're leading.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:19.280]   Many people have already determined what they wanted,
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.560]   and all they're seeing with Christ is help me.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.360]   I wanna go here.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.200]   I wanna go to this school.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.440]   I wanna marry this person.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.320]   I wanna get this job, and I want this.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.400]   Jesus, help me.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.640]   So they're not following Christ.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.760]   They're leading and asking Jesus to help them.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.600]   So the opposite of follow is to lead.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.980]   There's another word, to come late.
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.120]   He said the opposite of follow is to come late,
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.720]   which I thought was interesting.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.280]   If you're following somebody, and if you come late,
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.720]   meaning that you come at your own time,
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.120]   when you're ready, when you're ready,
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.720]   you're not following, just like obedience.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.200]   If you tell a child, hey, I want to take your trash out,
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.400]   he says, I will, but when I feel like it,
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.600]   when I'm ready, when I'm done with my homework,
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:23.600]   when I'm no longer tired, that's not delayed obedience.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.720]   That's disobedience, and that's what he says.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.860]   Again, this is the antonym of this word follow
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.600]   is to simply be late, or to fall short,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   or to linger behind, or to stand off,
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.640]   or to leave behind, or to forsake, or to abandon.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.720]   All of these words, according to the Greek dictionary,
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.840]   are the opposites of this word follow.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:54.000]   Disobedience doesn't always look the same.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.760]   Disobedience doesn't always come,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.920]   saying God says follow me, he said no.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:05.000]   Much of disobedience looks like not yet, maybe later.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.660]   Once I have this, if you answer me this,
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.760]   if you allow me to have this,
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.440]   and we're negotiating with God,
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:17.400]   but the word for follow, when Jesus told his disciples
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.520]   follow me, they left everything immediately.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.400]   They didn't say after a month.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.280]   Let me bury my parents first.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.120]   Let me take care of my job first.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.560]   Let me do this, let me graduate first.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.860]   Let me get married first.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:33.320]   No, when he said follow me, they left everything
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.880]   and immediately followed him.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.520]   And the reason why that happens is because
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.140]   in light of who Christ is, once the light gets turned on,
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.420]   whatever it is that we were looking at,
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:47.220]   whatever we were seeing, we were seeing from the blind spot.
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.660]   We were touching things, all of a sudden
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.680]   he switches the light on, and we realize
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.640]   we weren't on the right path.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.980]   We realized that we were possibly going
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.460]   to the bathroom in the living room.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.180]   I know that's a disgusting illustration.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.220]   But that's what we were doing in the dark,
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.660]   because we weren't seeing things properly.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.660]   We may have been sleeping in the garage.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:16.800]   Maybe we've been cooking lunch or dinner in the bathroom.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.620]   It's because we were trying to figure out in the dark,
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.340]   and all of a sudden he turns the light on,
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.420]   and he says, all of this is wrong.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.220]   Follow me.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.420]   He wasn't telling us to follow him
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.660]   because he wants to make our life harder.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.340]   It's because every decision you made,
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.940]   everything that you valued,
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.340]   everything that you've been practicing,
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.860]   you were doing in the dark.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.940]   And so he's telling us, follow me.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.900]   I will show you where you're supposed to sleep.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.020]   I will show you where I intended for you to cook.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.740]   I will show you where the car is supposed to be.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.240]   Your car's in the living room right now.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.140]   That's not what the living room's for.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.460]   And that's why he switches the light on,
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.400]   and he tells us to follow him.
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.700]   Not only does he tell us to follow him,
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:06.300]   he tells us that we also must be that light to the world.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   As he is our light, the scripture says
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.140]   we are to be the light.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.780]   Matthew chapter 5, 14.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.860]   You are the light of the world.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.180]   The city set on a hill cannot be hidden,
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.960]   nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.780]   but on the lampstand, and it gives light
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.900]   to all who are in the house.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.660]   Let your light shine before men in such a way
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.440]   that they may see your good works
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.880]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.060]   If we are the light of the world,
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.220]   and we live no different than the rest of the world,
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.860]   we value the same thing that they valued in the darkness,
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.920]   how can we possibly be the light?
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.380]   The reason why he tells us to be the light
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.020]   is to live as people that the light of Christ
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.220]   has been turned on.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.580]   It's been turned on, and we see things clearly now
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.340]   with an eternal perspective,
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.780]   because we've seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.120]   We've seen God's glory.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.700]   Even if it is dim, we've seen its glory.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:09.180]   We're no longer feeling around in darkness.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.860]   So that light that he has given us,
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.580]   he says now we are to take that light
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.340]   and go to the world and be a light.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:21.080]   A lot of times, you can preach the gospel,
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:27.300]   but if your life doesn't fit the gospel that you preach,
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.800]   all they hear is hypocrisy.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.620]   You can preach with power, with accuracy,
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:39.280]   with precision, with articulation,
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.120]   but all they see is hypocrisy,
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.660]   because what you say and what you do doesn't fit.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:54.160]   So that's why he says, not only to admire him,
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.580]   not only to say, oh man, I feel so bad for my sins,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.080]   but to follow that we may also be that light.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:08.160]   You see, every one of these I Am statements
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.820]   is challenging the Israelites normal, normal.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.340]   What they became accustomed to,
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:22.800]   what they were hoping for, what they were looking to.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.160]   The only difference between the Israelites
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.720]   and the non-Christians, the Gentiles,
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.440]   was that the way to get to the top,
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.800]   the avenue to get to the top was different.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.600]   Where the pagans were praying to their gods and their idols,
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.080]   or they built up their armies
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.220]   so that they can conquer the smaller nations
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.500]   so that they can be the superpower.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.240]   The only difference for the Israelites at this time
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.280]   was the avenue in which they were gonna achieve
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.880]   the same thing that they were gonna achieve
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.120]   is through their Messiah.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.040]   The easiest way to get on the top
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.800]   is to have the Messiah just come and conquer
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.100]   and feed them and take care of them.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.680]   So when Jesus says I Am,
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.740]   he's flipping their worldview upside down.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:08.920]   He said the food that you desire, I am that food.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:12.280]   The light, the Messiah that you're waiting for,
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.760]   I am that light.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.440]   The life that you are looking for,
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.040]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.440]   What is normal?
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.040]   Maybe for many of the Christians,
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.800]   what we consider to be normal
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.160]   really should be considered abnormal
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.160]   in light of what we profess to believe.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.720]   You know, if you look at, again, in conclusion,
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.280]   Genesis chapter one,
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.960]   the very first thing that God created was the light.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.000]   Chapter one, verse three.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   He says all he did, he said let there be light.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.120]   That's all he had to do.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.640]   And then what did he say?
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.860]   And light was created.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:02.280]   Simply by his word, just like he told Lazarus
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.100]   to give him life, to put breath back into him,
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.240]   all Jesus did was, Lazarus, come out,
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.040]   and by his words, with the authority that he has,
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.280]   brought him back to life.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.520]   God created all the light we saw instantaneously
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.240]   with the word of his mouth, let there be light.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.240]   But the light that he has come to recreate life in us
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.880]   wasn't that simple.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.200]   He didn't just say let there be light.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.560]   He didn't just say you're saved.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.120]   He didn't just say you're forgiven.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.280]   That same God who created the universe
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.640]   by the proclamation of his words,
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.920]   humbled himself, took on our flesh,
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.820]   lived humbly, humiliated, was beaten,
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:53.180]   punctured on his side with a spear, crucified.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:56.720]   All of our sins laid upon him,
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.760]   our burdens he took upon himself,
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.480]   and then he took our shame and atoned for our sins.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.360]   So the first light he created,
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.420]   even though we look at the vastness of the creation,
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.920]   all he did was let there be light.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   But the light that we celebrate,
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.480]   the light that we have been given,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.240]   Christ had to give himself.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:28.040]   And that's why, again, when Jesus says,
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.520]   "I am the light of the world,
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.520]   "he who follows me will not walk in darkness,
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.720]   "but will have the light of life."
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.860]   Maybe this period of quarantine,
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.740]   however long it lasts, whether it's a week or two weeks
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:46.560]   or several months, is a great opportunity for us
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.900]   to take some time to think, what is normal?
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.580]   Has the light been turned on?
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:57.540]   Did I actually see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.620]   Has that caused me to see sin in the world
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.980]   the way that God sees it?
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.540]   And then thirdly, am I following this Jesus
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.740]   or am I just admiring him from a distance?
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.660]   As we conclude, I asked our praise team
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:14.460]   to sing our final hymn, "Be Thou My Vision."
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.100]   So let me read this for us,
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.420]   and I know this is a hymn that we all know very well,
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.200]   but again, I want us to sing very purposefully,
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.320]   just looking at the lyrics of what it says,
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.180]   because it relates to the passage that we looked at.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:32.880]   It says, "Be thou my vision, O Lord, my heart."
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.140]   In other words, let everything that I see,
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:40.100]   let me see light in the light of who he is.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.220]   Be thou my vision, O Lord, my heart.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.300]   Not be all else to me, save that thou art.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   Let all other things in light of his light disappear.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:56.900]   Thou my best thought, by day or by night.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:00.220]   May the thought of Christ take the center stage
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:04.020]   of day and night, walking or sleeping.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.080]   Thy presence, my light.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.820]   Be thou my wisdom and thou my true word,
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.820]   I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.620]   Thou my great father, I thy true son,
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.060]   thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.000]   Let's pray.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.700]   Heavenly Father, I pray for all of us
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:31.280]   that we would not waste the time that you have given us,
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.340]   whether we are busier than normal,
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.700]   whether we are just at home counting the days
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.780]   that this quarantine would end.
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.240]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.300]   as Christ shook up the world with these I Am statements
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:47.560]   and what he did for us.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.140]   Help us, Lord God, to not go back to religiosity,
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.240]   to worldliness.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.300]   Help us to truly be the light of this world,
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.620]   especially as the world is in darkness,
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.260]   that our values, our hope,
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.920]   and what we are eagerly waiting to go back to
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.820]   would not look the same as the world.
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:12.980]   May Christ's glory and who he is
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.740]   cause us, Lord God, to reorient
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.560]   what we consider to be normal.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.700]   May Christ be exalted through all of this.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.800]   (gentle music)

[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.060]   Heavenly Father, we pray for all our brothers and sisters
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:58.420]   as we are in our homes, again, with young parents,
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.820]   with young children at their homes,
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:04.060]   and give them patience, give them extra amount of energy
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:08.360]   to be able to see the value of what you've given,
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.020]   no matter how hectic it is.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:13.480]   We pray, Father God, that your grace would be upon them.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.420]   We pray for those who are still working,
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.740]   that you would help them to be protected,
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:22.140]   but at the same time, to be a great light, Lord God,
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:25.380]   to people who are around them wondering
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:29.580]   maybe there's more to life than what they were accustomed to
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.200]   to help them to be bold, to speak,
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.500]   help them, Lord God, to be sensitive
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.640]   to the needs around them.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.260]   We pray for our health workers,
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:39.020]   especially that you would guard and protect them,
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:41.300]   that as many of them may be anxious, Lord God,
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.460]   of the situation that they're in,
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:45.940]   I pray that their faith may grow even stronger
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.300]   as a result of all of this.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.620]   Help them to see the unique situation
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.820]   that you've put them in, Lord God,
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.380]   that Christ may be magnified.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.140]   Help them to be the light of the world,
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.000]   and that their coworkers and friends
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.260]   who do not yet know you,
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.580]   that it would be an opportunity, Lord,
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.500]   to truly shine Christ's light on all of this.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.940]   So we ask, Lord God, that whatever time
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.720]   that you have ordained, whatever situation
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.180]   that you have ordained for all of this,
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.980]   help us, Lord God, not to simply waste it
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.700]   waiting, Father, to go back to what we were used to.
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:22.320]   Help us to use this opportunity to magnify your gospel,
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.620]   to bring the loss that they may also see you.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:30.840]   So we pray, Lord God, as we always do,
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.160]   but even now more so, for revival,
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.780]   that the churches may be strengthened,
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:40.060]   that all the fluff, Lord God, that we've been used to,
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.660]   that all of these things, Lord God, will be pruned,
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.020]   and that what would remain from all of this
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.380]   is genuine worship in spirit and in truth.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.420]   So we pray that you would help us
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.700]   to spend this next week magnifying,
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:59.700]   to thinking, to pursuing, and to gaze upon Christ,
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.780]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
