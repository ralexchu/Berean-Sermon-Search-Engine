[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   All right, this morning, I'm going to be taking a break in our study of the book of Hebrews
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.360]   to address an issue that is important.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.400]   I'm going to be talking about baptism.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.880]   Clearly, we have a baptism service that's going to happen this morning.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.560]   And again, just to kind of give you an explanation, we intended, normally we have a separate service
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.480]   at 2 o'clock, but this time we're doing it because of various reasons.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.360]   We're having our sister Susan, she's going to be baptized after the message.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.640]   But I wanted to give a clear understanding of what it is that we are doing.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.340]   There are a lot of things that we do in life that we do just because it's just done.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.120]   You know, if you travel, you'll notice one of the first things that you'll notice that
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.520]   35% of the countries in the world, they all, they drive on the left side, the opposite
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.120]   side of us where we drive.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.200]   So if you've ever visited England, you'll notice that the cars are coming the opposite
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.040]   direction, or if you go to, again, other parts of the world.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.640]   Like why do they do that?
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.800]   I tried to explain this first service and I got lost.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.960]   I'm not even going to attempt it.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960]   So just Google it.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.800]   There's a lot of things that we do in life just out of habit.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.660]   And so we're curious, but we don't really know the answer.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.520]   So this question, whether we're driving on the right side or left side, I mean, we might
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.880]   be curious, but we don't know in detail why we do it.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.840]   And it's not significant, even though this is something we do on a daily basis, not knowing
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   isn't going to affect your life in one way or the other, right?
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.860]   Other than the fact you visit some countries and they drive on the other side.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.040]   But there are certain things that we do without really understanding that if we don't understand
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.160]   it, it is detrimental.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.300]   It's absolutely important.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.120]   One of the things that we absolutely need to understand, to be convicted about, is the
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.280]   sacraments that we practice on a regular basis.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.280]   The reason why the churches call it sacrament is because it means it is sacred.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.880]   It is something that is set apart, not through church history, but the scripture.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.320]   Christ himself set it apart as something sacred that we ought to practice.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.880]   Now it's so sacred that in the early church, when they didn't practice it properly, remember
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.600]   what happens?
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.640]   Many people were falling asleep, meaning that they were dying.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.600]   There was a direct judgment that came upon them because they weren't practicing it the
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.260]   way God told them to practice.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.280]   They weren't considering it to be sacred.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   So what we do in baptism and what we do in communion, we may not experience, "Oh, we
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.280]   didn't participate in a worthy manner," so you may not have death penalty coming, but
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.680]   it does show us that in God's eyes, how important this is.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.640]   That this is not something that we ought to participate half-heartedly.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.800]   We need to know why this was implemented.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.440]   We need to know why we practice this, what is the meaning behind it, and why do we do
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.220]   it in this particular mode?
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.360]   Why are we a Baptist instead of a Presbyterian?
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.560]   I grew up most of my life as a Presbyterian because my dad was a Presbyterian pastor,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.320]   and at one point in my understanding of scripture, I had a radical change.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.080]   Before I get into it, first of all, what it is not.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.120]   I mean, at another time we'll be talking about communion, but today, because we're having
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   a baptism service, I wanted to emphasize, and again, it's going to be more informative.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   So the goal of my preaching this morning is not to inspire you to go out and do anything
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.800]   in particular, other than to engage in something that is absolutely sacred because the scripture
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.360]   says so.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.300]   What it is not.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.560]   There is no supernatural power in this water.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.600]   We didn't mix anything in here, right?
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.440]   She's going to go in there and then she's going to feel tingling and then come back
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.000]   out a completely new person.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.180]   There is no supernatural power in here.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.560]   Baptism is not something that Christians do after they became a Christian and then realize
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.440]   that, "Man, I really need to take my faith seriously," and then they decide to get baptized
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.280]   later.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.320]   Baptism is the first act of obedience.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.360]   It is symbolic, but there is power in this symbolism.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.440]   And I guess the best way for us to understand it is like when you have marriage ceremony.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.160]   We go through all the symbolism of getting dressed in white and men and the bride coming
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.880]   down the aisle, the lighting of the candles, the putting on of rings, cutting of cakes,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.120]   like all of that to symbolize that a new life is starting between two people becoming one.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.920]   So all of that is symbolic.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.640]   We don't ever attend marriage ceremonies like, "Ah, this is nothing."
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.880]   We know the importance of that, and it was meant to be public.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.720]   But we take more seriously the symbolism in marriage than when we do what God commanded.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.120]   See, marriage ceremony was not commanded in scripture.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.720]   It is not a sacrament that was commanded.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.600]   And yet in our culture, we take that very, very seriously, what we do in marriage ceremony.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.160]   In fact, as I officiate weddings, I mean, usually the people are so concerned that we
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.720]   get everything right.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.140]   I think that people are the most teachable during wedding ceremonies.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.120]   They ask me questions like, "Do we stand here?
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.000]   Do we stand there?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.520]   Who goes first?
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.940]   Who goes last?
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.940]   What is the beginning?
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.940]   What is the end?
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.940]   Who says this?
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.940]   Where do they stand?"
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.160]   Because they want to make sure that they get everything right, because it's important.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   Every part of that points to something.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.360]   But that was not commanded in scripture.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.780]   It's important for us because of what it signifies.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.360]   But baptism is commanded in scripture.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.680]   And though it is symbolic, when we obey it according to what the scripture says, it is
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.320]   meant to nourish the church.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.080]   So this morning, I want to dive into two things.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.200]   One is the importance of baptism and the meaning of baptism.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.720]   Importance of baptism and meaning of baptism.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.080]   So those of you who are visiting our church for the first time, it's like, "Oh, great.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.880]   The first service is going to be talking about theology."
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.840]   In fact, every week is theology.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.280]   Whether I mention theology or not, every week is theology.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   But today in particular, it's going to be theological.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.320]   Why is baptism important?
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.400]   If it is symbolic, why is it so important?
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.760]   If you look at the Great Commission, Matthew 28, 19, "Go therefore make disciples of all
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.400]   them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.200]   Now if you've probably heard many services, many sermons or Bible studies about going,
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.600]   right?
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.400]   If we're serious Christians, we need to be going.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.800]   We need to go to our neighbors.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.000]   We need to go to the remotest part of the world.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.520]   You know, we've just sent out the Tongs as missionaries to China, so they were going.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.440]   And then if you do a little bit of digging, you find out, it's like, "No, the imperative
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.000]   is to make disciples by going."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.800]   And so you probably heard a lot of sermons about making disciples, that we need to make
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.040]   this all about making disciples and we need to go.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.720]   So the goal is making disciples.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.800]   And you probably heard a lot of sermons about teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   you.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   That's why we have Bible study.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.320]   We have small groups, in order for you to understand that it's not just enough to say,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.360]   "I believe in Jesus," but then it says to teach them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.080]   you, to be obedient in our faith.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.720]   But we kind of skim over the baptism part, right?
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.600]   It says to make disciples by going, baptizing, and teaching them to observe all that I have
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   commanded you.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   But we know about going, we know about teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.240]   you, but this baptism part seems like just a religious ceremony, just kind of added in.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.720]   So we quote it, we memorize it, but we don't really understand it.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.680]   Why is this there?
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   When somebody becomes a Christian, first thing we ask is, "What church do you go to?"
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.120]   So say, "I confess my faith and I believe, what should I do?"
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   "Well, go to a church."
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   It's like, "Well, I'm at a church."
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.960]   "Well, then join small group."
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.480]   It's like, "Well, they have a small group on Wednesday, then what else should I do?"
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.160]   "Well, find maybe older brothers and sisters that you can fellowship with and get involved
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160]   with them."
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   Is there a community group?
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   Get involved with the community group.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   And you really should pray.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.320]   You need to really commit to the discipline of prayer.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.560]   And evangelism.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.160]   If your church has short-term missions, maybe you should do that.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.720]   If you have membership, become a member and serve in some capacity in the church.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.280]   And we have all these things that we tell a brand new Christian that this is what you
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.800]   ought to do, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.600]   But before we even get to that, he says to baptize.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.080]   Where in every instance in the New Testament, the very first thing that was commanded and
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.840]   practiced was baptism.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.160]   It was not just some religious ceremony.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.800]   You know, there's an issue in our culture where there's this cliche that people use
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.000]   in saying Christianity is not a religion but a relationship.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.480]   That statement in and of itself is true.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.160]   Christianity, you can't be a Christian just because you attend church, because you were
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.880]   raised in a church, or just because you went into the water and came out.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.640]   That doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.000]   So Christianity isn't simply about religion, but it is religion.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.160]   Because religion basically means a set of beliefs that causes you to live a certain
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160]   way.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   That's what a religion is.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.480]   So Christianity is a religion.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.520]   But religion in and of itself obviously doesn't save you if you don't have a relationship
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.980]   with Christ.
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:03.320]   The reason why I say that is because there is a disdain in our culture toward anything
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.960]   that is not personal with Jesus.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   So that's religion.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.120]   You know, "Oh, I don't have to go to church.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.920]   Don't tell me to read the Bible.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.440]   Don't tell me I have to live a certain way.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.400]   Do this or don't do that, because if you do that, that's religion."
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.040]   As long as I have this personal relationship with Jesus Christ, all this other stuff doesn't
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.560]   matter, which is absolutely wrong.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.280]   As I said, there are many things that the Scripture teaches, teaching them to observe
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.800]   all that I have commanded you, but these two particular things, and this one particular
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.200]   thing that we're addressing today about baptism, was absolutely commanded and practiced.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:49.160]   Acts chapter 2, 38, after Peter preaches his very first sermon, very first revival, they
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.720]   were convicted to the heart, and they said, "What should we do?"
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.640]   And he said, "Repent and be baptized."
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.500]   He didn't just say, "Repent and go to church.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.960]   Repent and do your quiet time.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.880]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.400]   of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.840]   Acts chapter 8, 12, Evangelist Philip preaches the gospel to the Samaritans.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.200]   They are convicted when they believe Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.000]   of God, and the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They were baptized, both men and women.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.080]   Acts 8, 36, "And as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.640]   eunuch said, 'See, here is the water.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.680]   What prevents me from being baptized?'"
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.920]   Acts 9, 18, "And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and regained his
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   sight.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.560]   He was raised and was baptized."
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.760]   And again, I can go all, give you other texts over and over again, and my point is that
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.440]   as Jesus commanded, as his last will and testament, to make disciples by going, baptizing, teaching
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.800]   them to observe all that I have commanded you, baptism was a key element of making
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.080]   disciples.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.000]   So the fact that this is important is crystal clear in the Scripture.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.080]   In fact, I don't know any denomination that doesn't see the importance of baptism.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.800]   The meaning behind it, mode of it may be different, but we all agree it is absolutely essential.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.400]   This is the first act of obedience.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.880]   So if this is this important, and if that is not in question, the second question is,
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.840]   then why is this so important?
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.600]   What is the significance of this baptism?
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.920]   Which is the second point, the meaning of baptism.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.080]   Well, I tricked you because it's two points, but this point has three points.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   Okay?
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.160]   So it's actually four points.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.360]   The meaning behind baptism, there's three things that I want to share with you that
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.620]   the Scripture teaches.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:51.680]   First of all, the reason why this is important is because of what it symbolizes.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.600]   It says in Romans 6, 3-4, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.160]   Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.600]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.840]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life."
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:17.600]   So first of all, baptism symbolizes our union with Christ in his death and his resurrection.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.640]   That's what it symbolizes.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.040]   That's what it proclaims.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.560]   Just like when two people come together and they get married, they light the two candles,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.520]   meaning that two families are coming together, and then at the middle of the ceremony, when
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   they're done, they will light one candle, right?
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.800]   And they blow out the other two candles, which signifies that these two people are becoming
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.920]   one.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.080]   The ring that they put on each other is a symbol of the eternal union, this covenant
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   that cannot be broken.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.680]   So when they put that ring on, it symbolizes this eternal covenant that they are entering.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.840]   Every part of that ceremony signifies something very important happening in that ceremony.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.800]   And it is meant to be public, and that's what the baptisms first and foremost represent.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.320]   That's why when Susan gets baptized, when anyone gets baptized, we ask the question,
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.980]   "Do you understand this, that you are uniting with Christ in his death, and you are uniting
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.160]   with Christ in his resurrected life?"
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.000]   The mode of baptism symbolizes that in and of itself.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.880]   The word for baptism in Greek is "baptizo."
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.320]   The word "bapto" basically means to immerse.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.580]   The word "baptizo" means to be completely immersed.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.820]   When it adds the word "izo" at the end, it's to intensify the word.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.760]   So basically, the word in and of itself that is used to describe this sacrament means to
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.600]   be immersed.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.200]   And it makes sense because of what it signifies.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.600]   It signifies death.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.440]   You never go to a funeral when somebody is only buried halfway.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.000]   You don't just throw dirt on them.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.400]   You don't just say, "Oh, we're burying them," and just throw up some dirt.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.360]   You make sure they're completely buried.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.760]   And then if somebody happens to be alive, you don't come out halfway.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.880]   You don't see just a hand.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   All of it.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   And that's what it symbolizes.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:20.360]   They are buried with Christ, and they are raised completely in the resurrected life.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.040]   It is designed for that purpose.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.400]   In fact, in the early church, every passage that I read, when the early church practiced
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.000]   this baptism, this immersion, it was done for that purpose.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   There's a reason why they did that.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Again, because of what it symbolizes.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.960]   It does not symbolize a covenant sprinkling from the Old Testament.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.720]   Again, this is where we differ with our Presbyterian brothers and sisters.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.600]   Like I said, I grew up Presbyterian.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.720]   I was infant baptized.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:16:00.400]   And then I chose to become a Baptist, again, though I was baptized as an infant because
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   of what I saw in Scripture.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   And I wrestled with this for a very long time before I decided I need to do what the Scripture
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   says.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.840]   And the reason why I did that is because it is not safe to simply go by tradition.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.040]   It is not safe to practice my faith, even if something that I didn't realize how significant
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.680]   was at that time.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:27.000]   It is not safe for us to simply do something simply because that's just the way it's done.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.760]   And so the more I recognize how important this was, the more important it was I did
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.080]   it the right way.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:45.400]   Baptist baptism symbolizes complete union with Christ in every way.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.000]   There is no halfway.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.560]   Again, if you were to use poker terms, you don't go halfway.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.880]   You're all in from the beginning.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.640]   Sometimes the Christians play, and then they put a little bit here and a little bit there.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.880]   And then, you know, when I graduate college, I'll go in a little bit more.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.320]   And then when my children grow up a little bit more, I'll give a little bit more.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.240]   And you're never fully all in.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.520]   You're always just kind of playing, and the whole while you're playing around, you're
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.960]   thinking that God is waiting just incrementally, right?
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.720]   You buried your arms, and next year, hopefully, you'll bury your legs.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.600]   And then a year after that, maybe you'll bury your nose.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:29.400]   And for whatever the reason, people live their Christian life in increments.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.040]   This baptism ceremony from the get-go, when we are baptized, signifies death with Christ.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.400]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.560]   It is no longer I who live.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.360]   And so when somebody goes into the water, that's what it signifies.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.960]   My old life, who I was, is gone.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.720]   My ambition is gone.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.100]   My desire to be somebody, it's gone.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.320]   My desire to be recognized, it's gone.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.480]   And then to leave a legacy, and I hear that a lot, even in the Christian circle, leave
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480]   a legacy.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   No.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.720]   The only legacy that any human being should leave behind is the aroma of Christ in your
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.480]   life.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.600]   I don't want people talking about me three generations later, like, "Oh, Peter was this,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.880]   and Peter was that," because I already know, you know, when there's good things, there's
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.440]   always bad things, right?
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.000]   I want them to remember whatever aroma I left of Christ, because it is no longer I who live.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.240]   And that's what this symbolizes, death of our old self.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.000]   And when we are resurrected with Christ, that we commit to this new life, new resurrected
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.320]   life.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.180]   In every way, that's why this water of going in and coming out is the right mode of baptism
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.920]   as it was practiced in the early church.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.640]   Secondly, it symbolizes forgiveness of sins.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.320]   In Acts 2, 37, 38, it says, "Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.440]   said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brothers, what shall we do?'
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.600]   And Peter said, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.680]   the forgiveness of sins.'"
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:11.040]   Again, in Acts 22, 16, "And now, why do you wait?
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   Rise and be baptized.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.800]   Wash away your sins, calling on his name."
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.960]   You know, part of the struggle that we have as Christians, when the Scripture says that
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.520]   just shall live by faith, we immediately think about how that's being applied.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.200]   Like, "Oh, I need to live by faith.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.720]   I need to trust God in my finances.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.520]   I need to trust God in my future."
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.360]   Which is true.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.840]   That is a part of the application of what it means to walk by faith.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.200]   But the first and foremost, most important part of walking by faith is believing with
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.800]   all your heart that your sins are forgiven.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.760]   That when you went into the water, the old self, whatever it is that you did up to that
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.920]   point, it has been crucified with Christ.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.800]   Christ forgave you and cleansed you.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.080]   And until you believe that your sins are completely forgiven, you will live your life trying to
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.460]   earn his forgiveness.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.020]   You may not write down that on your doctrinal statement.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.480]   You may never even confess that.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.560]   But in your heart, you will live the rest of your life trying to be worthy of forgiveness,
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.900]   which is a contradiction of terms.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:29.780]   To be saved by grace means to receive something that you didn't deserve.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.800]   So the first act of obedience, even before baptism, what the baptism represents, is to
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.820]   believe with all your heart that you are forgiven.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.280]   If anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.840]   He's not part of a new creation.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.200]   He's not some of the new creation.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.400]   All of it is a new creation.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.220]   His sins have been washed.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:58.560]   And the reason why we don't sprinkle is because sprinkling was just a shadow, because it only
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.360]   pointed.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.560]   It gave hints of what was coming.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.060]   And what was coming is absolute forgiveness.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.680]   Not just a hint of it, not just a part of it, not just what you did that day, but our
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.340]   very nature of who we are.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.820]   We weren't just simply cleansed of an act.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.600]   We weren't simply cleansed of something you said or something you did.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.240]   We were cleansed from the core of who we are.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.720]   Our very nature was transformed because of what Christ has done.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.100]   And that's what this water signifies.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.760]   A burial of the old self and forgiveness of our sins and to be resurrected in our righteous
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.800]   self because of Christ.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   That's why it says in Psalm 103, 11 through 14, "For as high as the heavens are above
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.200]   the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.640]   As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.440]   Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   him.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.840]   For he himself knows our frame.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.760]   He is mindful that we are but dust."
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.640]   He didn't forgive us because we are worthy of forgiveness.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.520]   He forgave us because we had no other choice.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.160]   And that's what this signifies.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:19.800]   A complete and thorough forgiveness of our sins, past, present, and future, if you believe.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:28.840]   Third and finally, receiving the water baptism signifies gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.760]   In Matthew 3, 11, "I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.680]   me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry."
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.320]   He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.840]   Again, in Acts 2, 38, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:58.280]   The real baptism that this signifies is ultimately preparing a place for the Holy Spirit to enter.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.400]   If the Holy Spirit is not indwelling in you, you're not a Christian.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   You're not a Christian.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.440]   You know, I know that in some circles that for whatever reason, I believe it's a wrong
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.320]   teaching that the Holy Spirit comes and goes.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.960]   You know, the Holy Spirit, like, "Oh, you've got to be filled with the Holy Spirit," and
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.240]   it comes, and then when you're not walking right, the Holy Spirit leaves, and that is
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.120]   unbiblical.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.140]   If you are a child of God, God cleansed you of your sins and created you to be the temple
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:31.560]   of God, and now the Holy Spirit makes us indwelling in you, right?
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.360]   That signifies two things.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.400]   One, that you have become sacred.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:45.560]   I know that as a pastor, that certain things you won't do when I'm in the room.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.360]   It's not because I'm holier than you, right?
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.480]   And I know years ago, and I don't think gangster rap is that popular today.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   Is it?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   Right?
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.400]   It's not popular today, right?
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.920]   I think, I'm just guessing, right?
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.120]   I remember years ago, like, people would listen to gangster rap, and I could hear it from
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.840]   a distance.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   I could hear it from a distance because I hear the car coming.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.040]   They got to blast it, and then, you know, I hear it.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.880]   And as soon as they come to the parking lot, you can hear the volume getting lower.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.680]   And then they come to pick me up, and I go in there, and then Christian music is played.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:27.080]   At some point, in that 300-yard drive, the volume went off, turned off, and then another
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.080]   channel came.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.400]   And all of it because they probably think that I'm going to judge them, right?
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.920]   Which I probably would have, right?
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.640]   But they were playing gangster rap.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.880]   And the reason why, not because I'm holier, but because I represent.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.440]   I represent God in their life.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.600]   There are certain things that you feel comfortable doing in the privacy of your own home that
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.640]   you will never do here at church.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.400]   There are certain movies that you will watch with your friends, or maybe in a certain context
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.480]   that you would never, if we played it here, you'd say, "Oh my God, what kind of church
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   is this?"
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.220]   In my house, it was okay, but here, how can you possibly allow that in the church?
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.680]   Because we consider this space sacred.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.200]   We consider certain things more sacred than others.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.600]   And I'm not saying that they are all equally sacred, but the scripture says, "Do you not
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.760]   know that your body is the temple of God now?"
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.160]   That it is not just that building.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.720]   It is not this place.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.280]   It is not just at a particular time.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:35.160]   He says when we were baptized, we were resurrected, the real baptism happened with the Holy Spirit
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.640]   entering.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.440]   And that's what Paul uses to rebuke the Corinthians church because they were being divided.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.640]   He said, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   in you?
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.120]   And he who defiles, meaning he who divides the church, God will bring judgment upon them
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.200]   because this is sacred.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.520]   The gathering of believers is sacred because each individual has become sacred by the Holy
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.240]   Spirit."
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.320]   So that's the first meaning behind that.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.280]   We have become sacred, sacred in the eyes of God.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:15.160]   Secondly, because we have become sacred, we have become set apart for his use.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.040]   The Holy Spirit just indwells in us so that we can feel good when we sing and then say,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   "Oh, I feel it."
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.600]   Again, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:28.120]   The work of the Holy Spirit inspires us, moves us, brings us to tears.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.640]   But the Holy Spirit is indwelling in us because it is groaning on our behalf because his presence
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.380]   is now in us.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.260]   He didn't simply tell us to come.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.500]   He sent this Holy Spirit to make sure that we come.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.920]   And so one, we have become sacred, but we have become sacred for the purpose of his
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   use.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.600]   It is no longer our lives to live.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.960]   The Holy Spirit now dictates to us.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.320]   The Holy Spirit now guides us.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:02.960]   The Holy Spirit now groans on our behalf to be reunited to our Lord.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.080]   This is the meaning behind what we practice.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.920]   As I mentioned to you, the reason why we don't practice infant baptism is because infant
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.780]   has no understanding of any of this.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.560]   There is no place in the Scripture where an infant is baptized saying that it's a replacement
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.960]   of the circumcision, so therefore you have special blessing upon you that you do not
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.120]   know of just because you happen to be in this church.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.240]   We don't see that in Scripture.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.920]   In fact, this is so sacred that we want to make sure that when somebody is baptized,
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.760]   that they are able to make a credible confession of faith, that they understand.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.200]   So when Susan goes in, we're going to be asking her, "Do you understand that you're going
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.840]   within the water to be united with Christ in his death?
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.720]   And you come out, you're going to be united with Christ in his resurrected life?"
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:57.960]   And she will answer yes, because if she doesn't, we have to pray in service.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.760]   I remember years ago, as a youth pastor, I went up to a retreat and one of my friends
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.480]   in the middle of the retreat said, "We're going to have baptism service."
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.040]   So initially I got excited, I said, "Oh yeah, we're going to participate in a baptism service."
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.680]   And again, this was years ago in a youth group retreat camp, and then he just had everybody
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.360]   get in swimming trunks and everybody jumped into the pool.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.480]   So there was about 50, 60 youth group kids.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.880]   We jumped into the pool and he looked at me and said, "Hey Peter, can you lead us?"
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.360]   He said, "We're going to have baptism."
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   I said, "For them?"
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   He said, "Yeah."
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.360]   And then he gave instruction, everybody paired up.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.000]   So they all paired up.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.840]   Everybody laid hands on each other.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.200]   Everybody laid hands on each other.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   Now everybody go in the water and come out.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.720]   So they all came in and came out.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   You're baptized.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.120]   And then he asked me to kind of oversee and pray for them.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   I said, "I was a young pastor then, but I don't think this is how you're supposed to
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   have baptism."
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.480]   Right?
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:03.080]   Looking back at it now, it grieves my heart that something that was so sacred, that was
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.380]   meant as a means of grace to nourish and strengthen the church, when we don't do it without thinking
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.600]   properly of its significance, it loses its value.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:19.360]   And it becomes just a religious thing that we do, which has no purpose and no meaning.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   Now I talked about baptism, but it is not isolated to just baptism.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.280]   We can do the same thing with our Sunday worship.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   You just checking in and out.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   Why do you do it?
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   Because you did it all your life.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   You just did it.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.580]   Like, why do we need to be here?
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.120]   Why am I here?
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.580]   What am I here to do?
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.320]   What is the purpose?
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.520]   Why is this important?
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.100]   And if we're not asking these questions and we're not digging and we're not practicing
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.520]   it purposefully, it will be no different than just jumping in that water and coming out
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.040]   and saying, "You are baptized."
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:58.620]   Like I said, for me to become a Baptist meant that I had to go against what my father did
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.480]   when we were young.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.360]   But it is, I cannot, I cannot follow tradition, neither can you.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:13.520]   You may disagree with the mode, you may disagree with the means, but you cannot disagree because
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.240]   of your tradition.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.600]   You must, if you, again, I know some of you, many of you are like me, grew up in a Presbyterian
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.320]   church, maybe you consider yourself Presbyterian even now.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:32.040]   And the purpose of this message, again, to convince some of you or to instruct for you
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.080]   to understand why we do what we do.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   And then there's some of you may require more attention.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.520]   If you have questions and you have more that you want answered, I'm more than willing to
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:48.540]   sit with you and answer some of the questions that you have and do my best to try to inform
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.760]   you why this is so significant.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:56.360]   This is just not some religious thing that we're doing because it's a church, right?
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.840]   We're Baptists and we're Baptists deliberately because we believe what we see in Scripture
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   is honoring God.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.880]   And this is not just about baptism, it's about everything that we do in church.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.760]   We want to make sure that we're practicing what he told us to do.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.040]   Well, at this time, I'm going to invite our sister Susan.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.240]   She's going to come up here and give her testimony and then we'll have our baptism ceremony.
