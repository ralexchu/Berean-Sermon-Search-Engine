[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - We're talking preaching gestures again,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.760]   and in the last podcast, in episode 49,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820]   we talked about the origin of your preaching gestures
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.400]   and why you use them.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.200]   With all the gestures that you've used, Pastor John,
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.700]   have you ever caught a glimpse of yourself
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.720]   preaching on video and thought to yourself,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.760]   that was pretty good?
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.040]   - I've seen some and thought, that's pretty silly.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.300]   (laughing)
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.240]   No, I don't think I responded that way.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   I rarely think that I've done a stupid one,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.120]   like you said, just as it is in heaven
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.560]   and your hand goes straight to the floor.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.040]   It's just the opposite of what you mean.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.160]   Somebody asked me one time,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.240]   do you have any favorite gestures?
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.480]   And I thought, I don't think so.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.720]   Favorite implies like you've got a repertoire
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.840]   and you pull them out according to your favoriteness.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.400]   I don't, but I think what they mean,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.600]   I mean, if they mean,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.460]   are there ones you fall back on more than others?
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.560]   Well, I must, because when people imitate me,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.320]   they do particular ones.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.320]   I've seen people do joke reenactments of John Piper.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.960]   I've just, we had my whole family sitting on a pew one time
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.080]   at my 20th anniversary and Steve Whitmer
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   did an imitation of John Piper
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.480]   in the pulpit for five minutes.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.440]   He had on the right glasses, the right coat,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.460]   had his hair combed a certain way.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.280]   And that congregation, including my four sons,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.340]   have never laughed so hard in all their life.
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.340]   I mean, my sons were falling off the bench with laughter,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   all because he spotted characteristic moves.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   I mean, he pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.800]   and rubbed his nose back and forth
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.760]   like I did more than I do now,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.900]   because now I'm so self-conscious of it.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.480]   But I must, you know, and the ones that I'm most aware of,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   I feel happy about because I think they go hand in hand
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.360]   with the definition of preaching that I have.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.240]   Preaching to me is expository exaltation.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.680]   Expository means I'm explaining things.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.160]   I wanna make them clear.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so my hands are trying to do in the air
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   what I'm saying with my mouth.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.120]   And exaltation means I'm trying to get hearts up to God.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.700]   So my hands are going up a lot.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.280]   They're going up a lot.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.720]   As I look at myself, they're up and they're out.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.840]   They're up and they're out.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.000]   And that's exactly what I wanna say.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.920]   I wanna say, go to God, go out.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.280]   Go to God, go out.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.840]   My hands are doing it right now even as I say it.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.160]   - So what do you think about people
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.520]   who enjoy the entertainment
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.080]   that some of your gestures bring?
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.320]   I mean, does that bother you?
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.720]   - It doesn't bother me, provided,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.760]   I mean, every time I hear something done with my voice
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.560]   or something done with my words,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.040]   I put the best face on it, which is,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.680]   this is being driven not by ugly mockery.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.320]   This is being driven by affection.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.040]   And if that's the way it is, I feel honored by it.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.080]   I wouldn't want it to distract people.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.600]   For example, sometimes people make a joke.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.440]   I'm not even gonna tell you an example
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.760]   'cause as soon as I do it, I contradict what I'm saying.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   They make a joke out of a phrase in a hymn
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.000]   that sounds like something else.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It might sound like a donut or something.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.160]   And as soon as you say it,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.640]   every time you sing that hymn now, you think of a donut.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.480]   It ruined it.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   And so I don't want people to be so fascinated
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.920]   with John Piper's arms or whatever
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.440]   that now that's all they think about
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.560]   'cause that would really, really get in the way.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.680]   Would say one other thing about gestures,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.320]   just that it seems to me that the Christian life
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.500]   should be a life of energy.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.720]   And that in a world of sin and opposition
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   and the call for endurance to be a stock,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.920]   still, sedentary, unmoving person,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.600]   it doesn't communicate the kind of life
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.040]   we're called to live in this culture.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.000]   You know, we should be a people of movement
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.520]   and a people of energy and a people of thrust
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.280]   and penetration of light and salt
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.040]   and doing in the world what the world needs done.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.440]   And so it just seems to me that an energetic portrayal
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.080]   of the word of God fits what the Christian life is.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.960]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
