[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540]   with me again to Nehemiah chapter 1. I'm going to just
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.680]   be reading two verses, verses 6 and 7. Again those of you
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.420]   who may not have been with us last week we are doing our
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.720]   last part of the series on the need for prayer, it's a push
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120]   to kind of set the right foundation for the rest of the
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.460]   year. And Nehemiah has heard report of what's going back in
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.300]   Jerusalem. These people came back to Jerusalem to rebuild
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.740]   the temple and they've kind of lost focus and got the report
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.440]   that the wall, the Jerusalem wall and the gate has been
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.940]   burned down and it seems like people are just kind of in
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.520]   neglect. So, Nehemiah is grieved over this and as a
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.080]   result of it he breaks out in prayer and then he ultimately
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.780]   is going to challenge the nation of Israel to pray. And
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.520]   then as a result of Nehemiah's ministry and preaching and
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.660]   praying revival breaks out during this period. So, I'm
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.260]   just going to be reading verse 6 and 7, Nehemiah's response
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.860]   in prayer. "Let your ear be attentive and your eyes open
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.040]   to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.900]   you day and night for the people of Israel your servants
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.380]   confessing the sins of the people of Israel which we have
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.840]   sinned against you. Even I and my father's house have sinned.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.220]   We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.080]   the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.560]   commanded your servant Moses." Let's pray. "Heavenly Father we
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   praise you and thank you for your goodness. We pray Father
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.700]   God that all the things that we have brought into this room,
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.340]   entanglement, busyness, distraction that we would lay
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240]   it all aside Lord God and be attentive to your word. Help us
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.880]   Lord to be a people who are committed to prayer, committed
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.980]   to know you, to follow you, to obey you. We pray Lord God that
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.420]   in our generation, in our lives, in our families that you would
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.920]   bring revival. That our affection for you may not simply
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.900]   be words. That we would not live day to day just feeling guilty
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.540]   and not ever pursuing what you challenge us to pursue. Help us
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.600]   Lord God to live a life truly worthy of the calling you've
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.400]   given us. So, we ask Lord this morning that you would bless us
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.080]   that in our weakness as we come before you that your spirit would
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.820]   be strong. That in our weakness you would be strong. That you
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.020]   would show yourself. And so we pray for your grace this
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.560]   morning Lord God as we seek you to worship you. In Jesus name we
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.160]   pray, amen." You know I think the main reason why I've been
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.020]   talking in the last couple of weeks about the need for prayer
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.200]   is not simply because you know here we evaluate and here's a
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.300]   bunch of things that we need to do as a church. And here's one
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.740]   thing that we lack, we need to pray more. Which is true, but
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.080]   that is not the main motivation behind why I've been preaching
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.980]   this and why we feel the need for the emphasis on prayer. The
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.420]   underlying reason why we need to pray is because we need
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.620]   revival. Revival. We need revival in our generation. We
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.520]   need revival in our homes. We need revival in our churches.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   As I mentioned before you and I live in a very comfortable
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.000]   Orange County Christianity where persecution we read in the
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.260]   news but it's not real. You know we've created a comfortable
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.500]   life. In and of itself that's not sin. You know being
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.740]   comfortable, having a great family and raising great
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.140]   children in a safe environment that's not--what parent wouldn't
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.040]   want that? I want that. But there is a great danger that
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.580]   comes along with wealth that we can easily forget who we are,
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.380]   that this is not our home. You know and our hearts can become
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.620]   easily hardened. And you know like with Christianity that we
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.260]   have as long as we are not sinning, as long as we are not
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.820]   going to strict clubs and paying our taxes that we are good
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.460]   because God loves us unconditionally. There is no
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.800]   striving. There is no pursuing. There is no brokenness. There
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.740]   is no crying out to God for lost souls. There is no passion for
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.280]   holiness. If we are not careful that can be enough. Because in
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.380]   comparison, in comparison to the others, in comparison to those
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.620]   who aren't studying the Bible, in comparison to those who
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.620]   don't come to church regularly we don't feel so bad. But as the
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.000]   book of Amos says when we put the plumb line of His Word
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.860]   against our lives and our thoughts and our hearts the way
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.300]   we spend our money, the way we spend our time, what grieves us,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.000]   what makes us happy, when we compare to the plumb line of the
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.340]   Word of God we have to first and foremost confess that we have
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.080]   drifted, that we are not where God wants us to be, that our
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   church is not what God desires us to be, that we ought to
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.720]   strive, we ought to seek. The passage that we just looked at
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.660]   this morning is about Nehemiah's prayer for revival. And he
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.760]   primarily prays, he begins by praying and by confessing his
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.940]   sins. Before he goes and says, "Those people, they need
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.440]   revival." He includes himself and again he leads in
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.080]   repentance. "It is me, it is my parents, it is my ancestors, we
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.380]   are in need of your forgiveness." Anybody who
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.720]   reconnects or connects with God begins with repentance because
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   that is the only way that we can connect with the Holy God. The
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.920]   only reason why you and I are able to be here is because at
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.100]   one point somebody preached the Gospel and you responded in
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.600]   repentance. You don't get saved by hearing the Gospel. You can
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.900]   hear the Gospel and say, "Oh, I agree with that, that sounds
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.540]   great." You don't get saved by hearing the Gospel. You get
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.340]   saved when you hear the Gospel and you are convicted over your
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.080]   sins and that caused you to come before God in prayer in
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.020]   repentance. So, whether you were led in formal prayer
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.860]   repentance, or whether you prayed in repentance by
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.100]   yourself, or whether you just kind of didn't know what you
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.460]   were doing and said, "God I want to receive you and I'm a
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.940]   sinner." However you came to that point you got saved
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.700]   because you responded in repentance. It is no different
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.640]   in our sanctification. You don't grow because you came to
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.980]   church and heard a message. It required you no work to come
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.840]   here this morning. Well, some work, you had to get up, put
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.280]   your pants on, right, and you had to grab your keys and you
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.220]   drove here, right. I prepared the message and now I'm
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.760]   presenting it to you. It doesn't cause you to grow, to
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.800]   just come and listen. Spiritual growth happens when you hear
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.860]   the Word of God and you respond to the Word of God. It causes
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.000]   you to come to Him in prayer, in repentance, and in
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.400]   obedience. Just hearing the Word of God doesn't cause you
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.300]   to mature. So, you can be at church all your life, hear the
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.080]   Word of God and never have a radical response to this. And
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.220]   in the end it has done nothing but made you a better critique.
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.720]   You know, you're a critic. It's just like somebody who is
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.560]   watching movies and you're critical. You have a critical
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.600]   eye over everything because you know everything about
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.860]   movies, how to begin, camera angle, you know, who these
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.740]   actors are, what genre. You know everything about it, but
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.400]   you've known nothing of making movies. It's like sports fans,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.000]   you're an expert of what quarterback should be doing
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.680]   what, who should be the point guard, and how it should be
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.580]   run, who should be the coach. We've become experts at these
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.180]   things and you've never played a game of basketball. See
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.420]   that's what we can easily become, come to church and we
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.260]   become hearers of the Word, and yet we don't actively
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:44.100]   respond. See, Nehemiah prays. It's a challenge not only for
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.540]   the people of Israel, but for all people, all of God's
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.100]   people to hear His Word and recognize where we are, and
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.100]   not just to recognize it and feel bad, but to bring us to
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.540]   God. What was the primary sin of Israel that Nehemiah felt
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.980]   the need to fast and to pray, and was crying and was
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.820]   weeping? If you remember last week the report was they went
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.520]   and they saw the wall was in disarray. No one was taking
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.860]   care of it. They saw the gate and it was burned down and no
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.560]   one was doing anything about it. The report that came back
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.800]   wasn't, "You know what they've got Asherah poles at the
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.180]   temple. They've got ball worship set up and they're
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.280]   having human sacrifices." None of that. The report was
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.640]   neglect of the wall. The gate is burned down and nobody is
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.480]   doing anything about it. That's what grieved him. Now, we can
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.960]   look at that and say, "Man, you know Nehemiah is kind of
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.320]   drama. Just fix the fence. You know what I mean? Get some
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.160]   carpenters. Get some contractors. You know what I
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.060]   mean? Paint it. Problem solved." Well, there is all
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.000]   this weeping and mourning because of a broken down wall.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.500]   See it wasn't just about the wall. It wasn't just about the
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.280]   gate. It was because the wall and the gates of this
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.580]   particular city of Jerusalem was at the core of God's
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.620]   covenant with these people. And to be in neglect of the
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.460]   temple, neglect of the gates, neglect of the wall basically
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.800]   meant that the people were no longer paying attention to
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.940]   what made God's people, God's people. They were just going
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:29.100]   about their business being busy. It wasn't immorality. It
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.500]   wasn't outright rebellion against God shaking in their
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.840]   fists. It was just simply complacency. That's what he
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.280]   was grieving over. It was important but it wasn't
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.520]   important enough. Haggai was another prophet that came a
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.220]   bit before him and ran into a similar problem that Nehemiah
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.200]   ran into. And this is what he says in Haggai 1, 2-6, "These
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.040]   people say, 'The time has not yet come to rebuild the house
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.540]   of the Lord.' Then the word of the Lord came by the hand of
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.440]   Haggai the prophet, 'Is it time for you yourselves to
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.380]   dwell in your paneled houses while this house lies in
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.180]   ruins?' Now therefore,' thus says the Lord of hosts,
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.580]   'consider your ways. You have sown much and harvested
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.520]   little. You eat but you never have enough. You drink but
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.060]   you never have your fill. You clothe yourself but no one is
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.060]   warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.500]   with holes.'" Does that sound very familiar to the judgment
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.440]   that God gave Adam? He said, "You are going to be laboring
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.080]   at the sweat of your brow and at the end of the days all
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.580]   that is going to produce is thorns and thistles." What he
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.040]   was saying here was that the whole reversal of the curse of
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.240]   mankind was because of this covenant that God made with
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.320]   the nation of Israel. But the moment that they neglected
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.680]   God and it was no longer important at the center of
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.420]   their life, they began to see the judgment of mankind
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.760]   manifest in their community. You are working hard but at
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.100]   the end of the day very little fruit. It wasn't an
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.800]   outright rebellion. It wasn't idolatry. It was simply
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.940]   neglect. You know in our churches, Orange County
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.220]   Christianity, our problem is not persecution. We don't have
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.060]   ISIS knocking on the door. As much as we feel pressured from
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.620]   the government that we can't say this, we can't pray in
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.260]   public, and we can't do all of this stuff, compared to what
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.200]   we see on television and news, I mean we are pretty weak
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.960]   sauce. People are concerned that we are going to a certain
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   part of India that the missionaries are not going
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.400]   into and they are afraid for our lives. We are pretty weak
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.340]   sauce, you know what I mean? Because there aren't
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.380]   foreigners there. And I'm part of it, because I'm raised and
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.940]   I'm part of Orange County Christianity. But the danger
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.380]   that you and I fall into isn't, "Ah, I didn't go to
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.580]   strip club yesterday. I didn't get drunk yesterday." The
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.420]   danger that you and I face every single day in our lives
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:05.600]   is just apathy, complacency. What you and I struggle with
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   when we come into this building is the struggling to
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   matter, that these things actually matter. To be reminded
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.180]   again that this is why we live over and over again.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.820]   Zephaniah 1, verse 12, the Prophet says, "At that time I
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.980]   will search Jerusalem with the lambs, and I will punish the
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.820]   men who are complacent. Those who say in their hearts, 'The
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.660]   Lord will not do good, nor will He do ill.'" See he said the
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.700]   complacent people are not in disbelief that God is going to
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.760]   do this, or going to do that. He said, "No, God just doesn't
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.540]   care." It's almost like every promise that God makes, "Ah, I
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.900]   don't know. I don't know. He said He's coming, whether He
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.480]   comes or doesn't come doesn't really matter. They don't
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.140]   believe that He's going to do good or bad. It's just me." If
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.140]   you look at the book of Revelation, the harshest
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:05.680]   judgment, I mean of the seven churches came to the church of
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.060]   Laodicea. And what was their primary guilt? They were
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.120]   lukewarm. He said, "Because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.560]   cold, I will spit you out of my mouth." Have you had anything
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.900]   come into your mouth that was so disgusting you actually
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.460]   needed to spit it out? You know what I mean? You ever eat
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.600]   something every once in a while? You eat something, and you
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.700]   have got to be polite, right? We are civilized people, you
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.600]   don't spit things out. You kind of, "Ugh!" And then you just
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.880]   kind of put it away, right? That's rude. But every once in
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.580]   a while something comes into your mouth that is so
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.720]   disgusting that the only thing you could do is, "Bsh!" I can't
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.920]   have it in my mouth even a second. That's the imagery that
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.200]   we see of a lukewarm church. God is so disgusted with it. I
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   mean consider all the other sins. Consider the sexual
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.740]   immorality in the churches. Consider people questioning
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.180]   the deity of Jesus. Consider the Gospel being perverted,
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.820]   the Judaizers, the Gnostics. Of all the problems in the
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.380]   church, the church that got the harshest criticism from
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:19.060]   God was a lukewarm church. See, you and I don't have that
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.520]   perspective, you know, because we tend to compare. Like as
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.820]   long as we are not, you know, we didn't come into the room
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.760]   drunk, we didn't steal from anybody, you know, we are
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.360]   trying to do a good job taking care of our kids, and we have
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.400]   a good marriage, and we feel safe. We have a Bible, we try
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.980]   to do quiet time, you know. How often do we see
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.140]   complacency from God's point of view? This apathy. How much
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.380]   God detests that, and how wrong that is, and how dangerous
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:53.340]   that is. You don't have to commit to destroy a home for
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.420]   the home to be destroyed. You know, years back when the
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:02.120]   housing market popped and these homes were being in
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.420]   neglect. So, some of these homes, you know, people were
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.620]   underwater with their mortgage. And so, basically what they
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.660]   did was they just packed up their stuff and left. So,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.700]   there were some neighbors that you can go to that you could
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.300]   tell no one is living there. The grass is, you know, two,
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.300]   three feet high. You know, there are broken windows. The
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.080]   fence is broken. The garage door maybe not completely
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.380]   closed. And you walk in, the house is a mess. So, when
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.640]   these people, the houses were up for sale, you walk in and
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.680]   the house was just a mess. There is molding everywhere.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.020]   There are pipes leaking. The bathrooms don't work
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.420]   properly. And it wasn't because somebody went in with a
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.920]   hammer and saying, "I'm going to destroy this house." Now,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.400]   some of those houses were like that. But most of these homes
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.660]   were simply from neglect. All you have to do is just leave
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.900]   it alone. Right? When there is a plumbing problem and nobody
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.580]   deals with it and after a while that little leak, if
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.140]   somebody lived in that house, all they have to do is just
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.380]   get some plumbing tape and/or call a plumber if you're not
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.080]   good with it and they'll just fix it and problem solved.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.460]   But a house that is in neglect, even a little problem can
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.260]   ruin the house. A little leak in the house that just dripped.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.220]   You leave that for a year, two years, the house can get
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.060]   ruined. It's just out of neglect. A little molding that
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.500]   you're going to be easily just taken care of and replaced.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.900]   You don't have to commit to ruin a house. All you have to
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:32.240]   do is just leave it alone. See, apathy and complacency is
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.840]   spiritual neglect. That we just kind of let it on. We just
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.680]   don't see it as a big deal until disaster happens. Apathy
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.160]   ruins worship. Because God clearly said, "I'm looking for
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   people who are going to worship me in spirit and in truth."
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.860]   You may have all the right things, come to church and do
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.040]   all the right things, but your heart is dead. Your love is not
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.240]   for God. You're just doing the right thing like a
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.180]   superstition. Just like any other religion if you go to the
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.180]   temple and do the right thing and burn the right incense that
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.780]   some being is going to bless you. If our worship is nothing
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.520]   more than rituals, it is nothing no different than any
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.760]   other religion. God desires more than that. So, apathy
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.600]   absolutely ruins our worship. If worship is at the core of
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.840]   our faith and our relationship with God, apathy absolutely
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:31.280]   destroys worship. Apathy affects our spiritual growth
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.580]   in Christ. As I mentioned you can come to church and hear
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.780]   the Word of God preached every single Sunday and it makes you
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.380]   more of a hypocrite every single Sunday. The more you
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.360]   hear the greater hypocrite you become every single Sunday
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.820]   because you have more things that you are neglecting.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:53.420]   Apathy affects our spiritual growth. It absolutely destroys
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.160]   the Great Commission. The greatest problem of the Great
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.540]   Commission is not that we have people doing it wrong. It is
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.480]   not that we have all this desire and then we are doing it
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.580]   the wrong way. We have the wrong system. We have the wrong
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.940]   discipleship. The greatest challenge to the Great
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:19.480]   Commission is apathy. We don't have enough people who are
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.000]   committed enough. So, that's why it always bothers me when
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.860]   people are like, "Oh, they are doing it wrong. You are
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.360]   supposed to do it this way. You are supposed to do it that
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   way." While they are sitting there in their comfort zone
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.840]   doing nothing. At least they are doing something. The
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.640]   greatest hindrance to the advancement of the Gospel is
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:46.020]   apathy. Apathy ultimately leads to spiritual ruin. It's not it
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:52.660]   might, it does. Spiritual ruin. You know what the most
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.760]   detestable thing to a non-believer is hypocrites.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.660]   Religious people who talk, but they are not any better than
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.260]   you. And I know we are not saved by our works. I know it's
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.800]   by grace alone. But if you've ever been a non-Christian,
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.400]   looked into the Church, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.680]   The greatest hindrance to the advancement of the Gospel is
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:25.040]   the people. It's apathy, complacency. See, no one will
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.180]   say, "I don't believe in God." At least not in this room. No
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.420]   one is going to say, "I don't want to follow Christ." It's
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   all words though. We don't love Him enough. We don't worship
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.420]   Him enough. We don't obey Him enough. See, it's complacency.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.060]   So, even though complacency, at least from our eyes, doesn't
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.200]   seem like a detestable sin before God. God sees beyond
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.700]   all of that. He knows what complacency leads to. Idolatry,
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.780]   a Christian doesn't all of a sudden get up and say, "You
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.080]   know what I'm going to go worship idols." That's not how
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.580]   it happened with the Jews. It was a greater sin than you and
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:11.520]   I recognize because of what it leads to. Nehemiah 9, if you
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.500]   can turn your Bibles with me to Nehemiah 9.16, and we are
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.300]   going to read a few passages in that verse. And it gives us an
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.540]   extended insight into the sin of the nation of Israel. Why
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.100]   Nehemiah was compelled to weep and cry over their sins.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:33.780]   Nehemiah 9.16 it says, "But they and our fathers acted
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.720]   presumptuously," in some of your Bibles it says arrogantly,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.580]   "and stiffened their neck and did not obey your
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.120]   commandments." You notice here that being stubborn and
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.960]   proud and disobedience kind of go hand in hand, right? And
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.760]   the picture is that if you own a dog, I don't know if you walk
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.500]   cats or not. If you walk cats, you don't walk cats. Cats do
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.800]   whatever they want, right? You walk the dogs. And you walk the
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.100]   dogs and the dog just doesn't want to go where you want to
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.940]   go. So, you are kind of dragging, and it kind of
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.080]   stiffens its neck, right? You got a leash and it's just like,
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   "No, I'm not going." And it's just miserable because you have
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.880]   to walk this dog because you don't want it peeing in your
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.580]   house, right? That's the picture that he draws of the
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.360]   sin of Israel, just stiff neck. You are unwilling to listen,
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.320]   despite. And you are just stubbornly doing your own
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:30.140]   thing. See, pride and disobedience go hand in hand.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.400]   Proverbs 16.18 it says, "Pride goes before the destruction, a
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   haughty spirit before a fall." When you see a proud man, or a
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.840]   woman, you know that God's judgment isn't too far behind.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.120]   But understand this, disobedience isn't simply not
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.680]   obeying God's commandment. Disobedience isn't simply not
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.120]   obeying God's commandment. Disobedience is just doing what
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:00.000]   you think is right in your eyes. You don't pursue what you know
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.860]   to be wrong. Very few non-Christians actually say, "I
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.300]   know it's wrong, but I'm going to do it anyway." Very few
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.280]   non-Christians live their life that way. And it's no different
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.080]   with Christians. I don't know any Christians who deliberately
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.280]   say, "This is wrong, it's against God, but I'm going to
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.940]   do it anyway." Disobedience isn't simply not obeying His
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.220]   command. Disobedience is just doing whatever you think is
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.320]   right in your eyes. In the book of Judges, is a period of
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.260]   Israel's history. And the whole period is described in Judges
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.100]   17.6. And this is how their sin is described, "In those days
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:41.260]   Israel had no king. Everyone did as he saw fit." Everyone
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.200]   pursued what they wanted. Everyone made their own values.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.600]   You know, "I'm glad you're about missions. I'm about
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.480]   family. I'm about Sunday school. I'm about missions."
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.580]   And everybody just kind of did whatever they thought was right
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.520]   in their own eyes. And as a result of that they kept on
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.480]   rebelling against God. What was the cause of their stiff
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.960]   neckness? What was their rebellion? In Nehemiah 9.17 it
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.500]   says, "They refused to obey and were not mindful of the
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:13.460]   wonders that you performed among them. But they stiffened
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.840]   their neck and appointed a leader to return to slavery in
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.440]   Egypt." Did you notice that? Why did they become so proud?
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.240]   Why were they disobedient? The answer, He says in verse 17,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:33.580]   "You weren't mindful." That was it. That was the beginning of
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.620]   the rebellion. They just weren't mindful. They forgot.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.920]   That's why the Bible keeps telling us, "Remember." Isn't
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.260]   that what we're doing every Sunday? We're doing, "Remember."
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.860]   Because we have such a short memory. No matter how much God
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.900]   is gracious to us one week, next week we come back we get
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.980]   distracted with movies, entertainment, with relational
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.540]   issues, and all of a sudden it's no longer at the forefront.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.940]   We believe Him, but it's not real. This is the beginning of
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.280]   this rebellion. See the neglect of the law and the gate wasn't
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.020]   a decision. It was just, "Ah, I've got other things. I've got
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.960]   things that I need to be worried about." Hosea 13.6
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.460]   describes not only that period but all of history. You know
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.140]   Hosea, the book of Hosea basically is a large picture of
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:31.780]   how God saw the nation of Israel. Repeatedly over and over
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.220]   again it says, Hosea 13.6, "When I fed them they were
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.080]   satisfied, and when they were satisfied they became proud.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.760]   Then they forgot me." I look at that and say, "That was a great
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.700]   rebellion. They forgot Him." When was the last time you got
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.560]   rebuked because you just forgot? Right? Because you just,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.660]   "Yeah, you know God is good, but I just forgot." It's like,
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.900]   "How dare you?" That was a great sin. This is what caused
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:08.840]   Nehemiah to cry out, pleading for mercy. Neglect. It was just
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:15.220]   neglect. It was just apathy. Like they cared, but they didn't
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.820]   care enough. God was important, but it just wasn't important
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.900]   enough. And they just went along in life. They didn't
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.400]   worship Asherah. I mean it's not that period. They were just
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:34.280]   kind of busy with life. See the reason why that was such a
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.140]   grievous sin before God was because God is a covenant God.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.340]   It's not purposeless. It's not aimless. God didn't create us
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.280]   and say, "Just go and enjoy until you die." He made a
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.120]   covenant with the people of God. And He said, "I'm going to
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.860]   send the seed of the woman to crush the head of the serpent."
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:58.460]   And it was to save mankind. It is not in the context of here,
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.900]   you know I made this nice island and then some of you
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.600]   guys can just get on and just live there. That was not what
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.740]   He's doing. It's in the context of a holy God who sacrifices
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.580]   everything to pursue sinners and to be in the midst of this
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:19.420]   history, this awesome news, the Gospel. And then to say,
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:25.160]   "Oh, ok, that's good. I'm thankful, but I've got stuff to
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.400]   do." In Psalm 10 verse 4 it says, "In His pride the wicked
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.040]   does not seek Him. In all His thoughts there is no room for
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.680]   God." It's not that they hated God. It's not that they
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.920]   despised Him. It's not that they wanted to reject Him. It's
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.360]   just there's no room for God. I'm busy. I'm caught up in
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.920]   life. I've got things that I need to take care of. That's
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.400]   what it was. And He says, "The pride of the wicked is that He
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:08.240]   does not seek Him because there is no room for Him." If we
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.580]   ended the sermon here, I mean it's ok, bad people. It's all
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:21.920]   bad people. The end. Enjoy your lunch. But obviously the
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.620]   purpose of Nehemiah is not to simply point out this is where
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.460]   Israel is. The point of the book of Nehemiah and Nehemiah's
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.800]   prayer and pleading before God is to bring them back to the
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.840]   Lord. And that's what happens in Nehemiah chapter 9. If you
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.640]   can turn your Bibles to Nehemiah chapter 9, and I'm
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.020]   going to stay here for a little bit. Nehemiah is
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.580]   calling the nation of Israel to repent. And he says in
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:51.180]   verse 17, "The primary problem is you just forgot. You would
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.300]   think that if God fed them and they were satisfied that it
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.600]   would lead to praise and thanksgiving. Instead they
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:02.560]   become proud." Isn't that us? Let's confess, isn't that us?
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.900]   When we are desperate we cry out to God, and God answers
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.240]   our prayers. And for that moment it's like God is so
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.440]   good. God is so good. And as soon as our needs are taken
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.040]   care of we are no longer passionately pursuing Him. And
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.680]   then we feel like we can live our life without Him. There is
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.820]   no sense of urgency. And once we become proud then we forget.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.280]   You know we just kind of live our lives. Until some other
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.160]   emergency comes. And then we cry out to God, and God
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.560]   answers our prayers. And then we are thankful for a bit.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.900]   And then we become proud, and then we forget. Right? Well,
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.200]   he says it's because you weren't mindful. So, what he
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.740]   does in Nehemiah chapter 9, verse 6 he reminds them who
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.680]   it is that they have been neglecting. "You are the Lord,
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.380]   You alone. You have made Heaven, Heaven of Heavens,
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.220]   with all their hosts, the earth and all that is on it.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.660]   The seas and all that is in them. And you preserve all of
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.560]   them. And the host of Heaven worships you. You are the
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.400]   Lord, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of the
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.200]   Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. You
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.840]   found his heart faithful before you and made with him
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.140]   the covenant to give to his offspring, the land, the
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.180]   Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.980]   Jebusites, and the Gergeshites. And you have
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.340]   kept your promise for you are righteous." In other words
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.220]   this is the God that you have been neglecting. And you
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.780]   saw the afflictions of our fathers in Egypt and heard
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.180]   their cry at the Red Sea. And performed signs and wonders
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.560]   against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.960]   of his land. For you knew they acted arrogantly against our
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.760]   fathers. And you made a name for yourself as it is to this
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.640]   day. And you divided the sea before them so that they went
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.900]   through the midst of the sea on dry land. And you cast
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.780]   their pursuers into the depths as a stone into mighty
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.940]   waters. By pillar of cloud you led them in the day, and by
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.380]   the pillar of fire in the night to light for them the
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.620]   way in which they should go. You came down on Mount Sinai
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.920]   and spoke with them from Heaven and gave them right
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.220]   rules and true laws, good statutes and commandments. And
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.760]   you made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.960]   them commandments and statutes and laws by Moses your
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.560]   servant. You gave them bread from Heaven for their hunger
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.100]   and brought water for them out of the rock for their
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.740]   thirst. And you told them to go in to possess the land
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.380]   that you had sworn to give them. He's just basically
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.540]   outlining the grace of God. I mean he could have wrote the
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.180]   whole Old Testament just about the mercy and grace of God.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:32.220]   He said, "This is the God you've been neglecting." But
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.320]   despite all that, starting from verse 16, I want you to
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.860]   recognize how many "buts" from here point on, ok? Despite
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.640]   all of that, verse 16, "But they," our fathers, "became
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.260]   arrogant and stiff-necked, and did not obey your
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.600]   commands. They refused to listen and failed to
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.500]   remember the miracles you performed among them." You
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.540]   know the people that we tend to invest the most in, you
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.080]   know those are the people that tend to hurt you the
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.820]   most, because you expect that, you don't expect that,
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.360]   you pour it. Sometimes it could be from your children.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.320]   You know those of you who have small children, you
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:17.660]   haven't been hurt yet. The more time you spend, the more
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.640]   sacrifice you make, and the hormones are going to come
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.240]   and get them, you know what I mean? And during that
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.500]   period they are going to say and do some stuff that are
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.340]   very insensitive and hurtful, despite everything
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.520]   you've done. And it is very painful when that happens,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.780]   because so much grace and mercy and sacrifice went into
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.280]   raising them. And you are being patient hoping that
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.020]   they'll grow and they'll realize one day that they'll
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.920]   be mature enough to see the sacrifice that you've made.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.560]   See when he says, "Despite all of that, despite all of
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.540]   what God has done," their response was they forgot Him,
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:00.300]   they just went their own way. But in verse 17, 25 he says,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.340]   "But there is a bigger but than the first but." But you
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.680]   are a forgiving God, gracious in compassion, slow to anger
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.180]   and abounding in love, therefore you did not desert
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.660]   them. Even when you cast for themselves an image of calf
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.120]   instead, this is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.700]   or when they committed awful blasphemies. Even when they
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:28.100]   committed idolatry. Even when they perverted the worship of
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.300]   God right after He delivered them from Egypt, because of
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.200]   their groaning and crying out when God responds to them.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.540]   Even though, even though they did that, he says, "God was
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:45.380]   still gracious." But the buts get bigger. Israel's history
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:51.280]   does not stop there. Nehemiah 9, 26, "But despite His grace,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.120]   but they were disobedient and rebelled against you. They
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.320]   put your law behind their backs. They killed your
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.960]   prophets who had admonished them. In order to turn them
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.700]   back to you they committed awful blasphemy." Despite
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.900]   His grace, and despite your sin, despite His being
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.980]   gracious, again they turned against you. But the but that
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.740]   comes after that gets even bigger. Nehemiah 9, 27, "But
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.820]   when they were oppressed they cried out to you from heaven
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.920]   and you heard them. And in your great compassion you gave
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.720]   them deliverers who rescued them from the hand of the
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:33.600]   enemies." You would think at some point God would say,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.840]   "Enough, enough." You would think that the buts would stop
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.540]   there and that would be enough. They would have learned
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.580]   their lesson. But the buts keep going. Nehemiah 9, 28,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.680]   "But as soon as they were at rest they again did what was
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.920]   evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:01.520]   their enemies so that they ruled over them." But is not
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.360]   mentioned in the next passage, but is assumed. Nehemiah 9,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.900]   28, "And when they cried out to you again you heard from
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.200]   heaven and in your compassion you delivered them time after
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.940]   time." By this time you should know what is coming.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.380]   There's more buts. Nehemiah 9, 29, "You warned them to
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.980]   return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.060]   your commands. They sinned against your ordinances by
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.260]   which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.720]   turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:44.140]   refused to listen." Oh my gosh, again. All of God's
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.340]   mercy, all of His mercy, all of His forgiveness, all the
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:55.740]   buts, it doesn't stop. They keep turning. But here is the
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:03.220]   biggest but of them all. In Nehemiah 9, 31, "But, after
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:09.100]   all that, but in your great mercy you did not put an end
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.900]   to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.340]   merciful God." The only reason why you and I are here today
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:24.680]   is because of the buts. Despite your rebellion, despite
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.440]   our stiff-neckedness, despite our tendency to be entangled
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.280]   and forget, despite the fact that apathy has become a part
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.520]   of our lives, God calls us, and calls us, and calls us.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.100]   So, when Nehemiah comes and he's calling Israel to
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.900]   repentance, this was not the first time, second time,
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:47.000]   third time, fourth time, fifth time, or sixth time. When
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.740]   Peter asked Jesus, "If a brother sins against me,
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.600]   should I forgive him seven times?" When Jesus says,
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.080]   "Seven times seventy." Do you think possibly that Jesus was
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.020]   thinking about the nation of Israel? And how many times He
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.820]   forgave them? And how many times He restored them? And
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.760]   how many times they rebelled against Him? And how many
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.020]   times He responded in grace and mercy when they cried
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:17.200]   out? Turn your Bibles back with me to Nehemiah 1, verse
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:27.600]   9. Nehemiah 1, verse 9, God responds to their prayers and
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   He says this, again with a "but." "Despite all of that,
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.940]   despite all that you have done, despite all that you have
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.220]   said," verse 9, "but if you return to Me and keep My
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:50.220]   commandments and do them, though you are dispersed, be
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.520]   under the farthest skies, I will gather them from there
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.720]   and bring them to the place that I have chosen to make My
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.260]   name dwell there." Some of your translations I think the
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.640]   NIV says, "the farthest horizon." In the ESV it says,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.800]   "the farthest skies." And what He means by that is no matter
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.240]   how far you have fallen, no matter how long it's been, no
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.180]   matter how far you've run from God, no matter how deep, how
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:23.460]   dark your life may have become, that if you confess, if
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.920]   you return, I will receive you. And the question that we
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.100]   have is why? Why would He put up with stiff-necked people
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:42.880]   like Israel? And why does He still call us today? You
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.040]   know there are certain things that need to get done in the
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.680]   Church, and we have to tap into the right people. You
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.860]   know some of you are not good with children. Ok? I'm not
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.420]   going to point you out, but some of you are not good when
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.920]   you are around the kids cry. Right? And there are some of
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.220]   you who love children. You are good with children. So, if
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.560]   we need babysitting, you know who we are going to tap into,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.900]   because I don't have to twist your arm. So, you know usually
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.540]   in nursery we have a big volunteer because there are so
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.700]   many people who love children. And they actually feel
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.340]   rewarded. The kids are cute, and they come back, and we
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.380]   are thankful, and they are thankful, and the kids are
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.640]   happy. Great. You know. But some of you, you know, like we
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.280]   need, we have exhausted all these people, and now we have
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   to tap into some of these people who are reluctant. And
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.060]   we are going to twist your arm. You know, and you've got
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.220]   some guilt. You know what I mean? To not harden your heart.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:40.560]   You know. Right? And we have to twist your arm to get
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.660]   something done. And it is very difficult and strange. Right?
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:51.680]   At the core of the heart of God is compassion. When we
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.740]   confess our sins and asking for forgiveness, we are not
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.780]   twisting His arm. We are trying to get Him to do
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.320]   something that He is reluctant to do. We are not
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.120]   coming before Him and trying to find techniques to kind of
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:13.600]   get Him to turn. The Scripture says this is who He is. He
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.640]   does not delight in the destruction of the wicked. He
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.000]   delights to see His people in repentance and come in
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:27.040]   returning. So, we don't need to come and try to bend His
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.120]   arms and bend His will. It is His nature. It is His desire
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.620]   to forgive. Despite all the rebellion, despite all the
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.160]   arrogance and the pride that every single one of us is
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:46.800]   guilty of, He calls us to Himself. "Come to Me. Come to
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:52.360]   Me all who have become heavy laden and burdened, who have
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.840]   been distracted, who have been living in apathy, who have
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.500]   been envying the world, coveting the things that God
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.000]   said He came to deliver us from, an empty way of life.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.580]   All who are distracted, all who have been making excuses,
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.880]   all who have been burdened by life because you didn't put
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.420]   Christ at the center, come to Me all who are weary and
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:19.600]   heavy laden. I will give you rest." Why? Why does He give
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.940]   us rest? Are you deserving of that? Am I deserving of that?
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   Is that why I respond? It's unfathomable. Why would a God
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:37.620]   who has everything be so gracious to us? 1 John 1:8,
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.820]   "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves. And
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.520]   the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.400]   faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.560]   purify us from all unrighteousness." Maybe some of
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.100]   you guys have been a Christian for a while and this is
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.180]   nothing new. Call to repentance, renewal,
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.240]   rededication, it's nothing new. Maybe some of you guys
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.520]   are sitting here saying, "Seen it and done it." Right?
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.780]   Especially our church has been around almost 20 years now.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:13.260]   You know, small groups, seen it, done it. Discipleship,
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:18.560]   seen it, done it. Mission, seen it, done it. Right? And
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.360]   you kind of have this like, "Well, I've been through so
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.160]   many cycles, I just don't believe in anything anymore."
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:29.540]   Good. If that's you, good. Because it was never about the
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:33.700]   small group. It was never about the one-to-ones. It was
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:38.540]   whatever system that you've lost hope in, good. Because
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.480]   it was never about that. All of it was to get you to come
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.320]   to Christ. And if you've been disappointed with people,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.620]   if you've been disappointed with programs, if you've been
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.420]   disappointed with systems, good. Because until we
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:00.060]   recognize that Christ is, everything else is going to
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:05.100]   disappoint you. He calls us to Himself. Because rebellion
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:10.740]   begins with pride, revival begins with humility. Let me
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.640]   say that again. Because rebellion begins with pride,
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.580]   revival begins with humility. And there is nothing more
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.260]   tangible that we can do as human beings than to humble
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:26.020]   ourselves and seek His face in prayer. And that's why we
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.060]   need to pray. So, we do not neglect our salvation. That's
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.020]   what it says in Hebrews 2, 1-3. "Therefore, we must pay
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.500]   much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:42.060]   away from it." Drift away. "For since the message
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.440]   declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.240]   transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:55.140]   how shall we escape if we neglect such a great
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:43:02.320]   salvation?" I pray that along with me and the leaders and
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.920]   the rest of the brothers and sisters in Christ, that we
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   would pray earnestly from the bottom of our hearts that we
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.060]   would desire Him above everything. Above friendship,
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.360]   above great marriage, above great business, above even
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.200]   bearing fruit. That God would bring a revival in our hearts.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.780]   And that the joy that we have in our lives would be because
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:29.040]   we have Him. In comparison to the surpassing knowledge of
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.080]   knowing Jesus Christ, that all will become rubbish. And that
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   we would pray, and pray earnestly, and cry out to Him
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.960]   until God hears and He forgives. Would you take a few
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.660]   minutes to pray with me? Again, everything that I've been
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:48.560]   preaching about in the last few weeks, it is not simply so
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.240]   that we can know why prayer is important. So, ultimately so
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.000]   that you can respond, that each one of us would
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.780]   collectively, privately, publicly, corporately, to
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:07.440]   sense our desperation before God. Yes, some of you are
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.680]   going to go home and be excited, but not have the
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.960]   discipline to carry it out. Seek accountability. Some of
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.620]   you are going to struggle and you are entangled with things
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.500]   that you are not going to easily break away from. But to
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.500]   recognize our desperateness and confess it to our brothers and
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.700]   sisters, that we may ultimately, even if it is
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.840]   incrementally, that we would begin to head toward a revival.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.340]   That until He is worshipped in spirit and in truth, that
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.480]   everything in my life isn't as important. So, would you come
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.920]   before me as a worship team leads us? Take some time to
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.260]   confess before the Lord. "Lord, I've sensed apathy in my heart
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.760]   and I desire a revival that would remember again why I
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.500]   became a Christian. What caused me to love you and to
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.760]   remember that again?" So, again, let's take some time as
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.400]   we pray before God, confessing and asking the Lord for
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.440]   revival in our hearts. Let's pray.
