[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.140]   In our early rise service, I'm going to read it again before we jump in.
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.860]   "But on the first day of the week at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.860]   they had prepared.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.380]   And they found a stone and rolled it away from the tomb.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.460]   But when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.100]   While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.940]   And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them,
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.180]   'Why do you seek the living among the dead?
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.420]   He is not here, but he has risen.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.060]   Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee that the Son of Man must be delivered
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.620]   into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.'
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.240]   And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all these things
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.860]   to the eleven and to all the rest.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.980]   And it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary, the mother of James, and the other women with
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.100]   them, who told these things to the apostles.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.300]   But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780]   But Peter rose and ran to the tomb, stooping and looking in.
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.260]   He saw the linen clothes by themselves, and he went home marveling at what had happened."
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.260]   Let's pray.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.780]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for what this day represents for all
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.420]   of us.
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.060]   We pray, Father God, as we come to remember and to celebrate the resurrection of Christ,
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.780]   that it would have that impact that you desire, that the same power that resurrected Christ
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.820]   that lives in us would renew us and revive us, restore us, that we may live a life truly
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.760]   worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.660]   May your name be honored.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.500]   Allow our worship to be sincere, and that Christ and his suffering, Lord God, and his
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.420]   resurrection may be exalted.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700]   You know, this week I was on campus on Thursday.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.860]   We normally do on Thursday, we go out and try to share the gospel with the people.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.460]   And usually I'm pretty, I have to be pretty selective because I see an older guy walking
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.700]   on campus, and when I approach them, they immediately like, "What is he doing on campus?"
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.740]   And then when I try to share the gospel, it's not like before where I can just have casual
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.740]   conversations.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.160]   So I have to target people who don't seem intimidated.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.300]   So I was on campus and rarely I see somebody my age there, and I saw a guy, he was an Asian
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.100]   man probably in his late 50s, and I was able to share the gospel with him.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.660]   And he was actually very interested, and I started having a conversation and found out
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.300]   that he was a man from Nepal, and he was here in some exchange program with UCI, and then
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.980]   it was some sort of a, he's here to learn English, but he was only here for about four
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.980]   or five years.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.640]   And he said that there was a group of other people from Nepal who came with him, and in
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.360]   the midst of the conversation found out that he was a devout Buddhist.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.720]   I've had many conversations with Buddhists before, and I actually even did a paper when
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.200]   I was in college about Buddhism, the beginning of it and different things that they teach.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.680]   And I was really intrigued because he knew a lot about Buddhism.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.360]   He was a very devout, committed man, and he's in his late 50s, so 50 plus years he's been
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.240]   studying, and he takes his faith very seriously.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.120]   So of course I wanted to share the gospel with him, but I wanted to find out more about
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   what he believed.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.680]   And so about 30 minutes straight he just started going off about his doctrines, and it was
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.000]   really intriguing because he was telling me stuff that, some of the stuff I've never heard
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.480]   before, so it was just interesting.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.040]   Oh, this is what you believe in.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.920]   This elaborate system of how to get to nirvana, and what are some of the teachings, and how
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.140]   there's three different stages of how to get there.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.960]   And so it was very, very interesting, because again, some of it I've never heard before.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.280]   And obviously I was looking for an opportunity, so okay, now I'm going to break in.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.200]   You know, when am I going to jump in?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.400]   And so I just kind of let him finish his story, and it was interesting to a certain degree.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.720]   And so when there was a little break, I stopped and I asked him, "So this is what you believe?"
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.360]   He said, "Yes, I believe this."
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   I said, "Well, how do you know it's true?"
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.180]   So you know, he was going on for 30 minutes, and he's like, "Huh, you just have faith."
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.540]   So that's what everybody, I said, "Okay, so I'm just, I'm not questioning you, but I'm
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.640]   just asking, I'm just interested in how you came to this conclusion."
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.360]   So because anybody can just say, "Here's what I believe, you know, like I flew, you know,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.120]   and I landed here today."
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.920]   And I said, "Well, how do I believe you?
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.640]   Like how do you believe that?"
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.100]   If you just say faith, then anybody can just say anything, say you just need to believe.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.200]   And so he just kind of like, "Well, you just have to believe, I guess."
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.260]   I said, I asked him, so I asked him further, "Do you think you believe what you believe
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.920]   because you tested this out and it was proven to you and you really like, this is what I'm
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   convicted about?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.220]   Or you just happen to be raised, born and raised in a country that taught Buddhism and
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.220]   your parents are Buddhists?"
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.000]   And he said, "Probably both."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.960]   You know, so I asked him, "So what part of it have you wrestled with and have come to
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.120]   the conclusion?"
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.200]   And so as we were going back and forth, and again, this was not an argument, I was just
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   asking him a question.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.440]   It's like, "How do you know this is true?
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.400]   You're telling me this because if you say you do this and you do this, you're going
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.680]   to get here and you have this elaborate system of how to achieve nirvana, but how do you
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.160]   know if any of this is true?"
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.300]   And so basically his conversation got stuck.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.260]   So obviously I asked him, "Well, do you know what the Bible says?"
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.460]   And so I was an opportunity, I found out that he's never heard the gospel before.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.120]   He's been here for five years.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.060]   He's never had a conversation with a Christian, ever.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.080]   You know, from where he comes from, there's no Christians there.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.100]   So he's here for five years and he's heard of Christians, so he thought he knew what
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.220]   Christianity was, but he's never had a conversation before.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.260]   So it was a great opportunity to speak to him.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.220]   Now, the reason why I bring this up is because even as Christians, if somebody was to ask,
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.660]   "Why do you believe what you believe?"
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.340]   What would be your answer?
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.460]   Is it because you were raised in a Christian home?
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.660]   You just happen to be in a Christianized culture?
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.460]   And so we just, that's what you are.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.660]   And that's what, if you go to China or different parts of the world where Christianity is not
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.020]   prominent, that's what most people will think.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.380]   "Oh, you were raised in the West, so you're a Christian."
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.260]   That's just part of your culture.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.220]   Would our answer be any different than that man?
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.660]   See, for Christians, what we celebrate today is at the center of Christianity.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.580]   If somebody can come out and definitively say the resurrection did not take place, it
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.500]   would unravel everything that we believe.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.780]   What happened for the last 2,000 years?
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.380]   Churches, missionaries, the teachings, seminaries, all of this would be for nothing.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.860]   In fact, from the very beginning, Paul says that in 1 Corinthians 15, 14, "And if Christ
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.380]   has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in vain."
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.060]   In fact, the scripture itself says that.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.180]   If the resurrection did not take place, all of this is just a hoax.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.640]   And it's not just us.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.540]   This morning, hundreds, maybe millions of people around the world woke up early in the
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.860]   morning to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.260]   It means all of that was for nothing.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.660]   I mean, this is the biggest lie that has ever been told.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.980]   In fact, the resurrection was so important in the early church, the primary message in
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.140]   their preaching was about the resurrection.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.260]   For the sake of time, I'm not going to go there, but in Acts chapter 2, when Peter begins
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.940]   to preach the very first gospel, the central message of the gospel was about the preaching
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.180]   of the resurrection, that this Messiah that you killed was raised from the dead.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.500]   Paul says when he was defending himself in front of the Roman governor, he says the same
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   thing.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   The reason why I am on trial today is because of my belief and the hope that I have in the
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.440]   resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:20.140]   So the central message of Christianity begins and falls on the reality of the resurrection.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:26.100]   If this is true, then everything that we proclaim, everything that is written in scripture has
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.720]   tremendous ramification.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.620]   If it is not true, it is all for nothing.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.660]   In fact, some people may say, "Well, what did you lose?
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:40.500]   You went to church, had some good friends, got to play softball, football, get to eat
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.820]   gourmet hamburgers after service.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.340]   I mean, what did you lose?"
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.900]   Think about all the people who are dying in the Middle East right now, and all they have
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.180]   to do is say, "I deny Jesus.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.580]   I don't believe in any of that stuff."
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.400]   Think about all the people who forsook everything to go and preach the gospel.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.120]   Think about Pastor Alex's family.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.040]   Think about our friends who went up north to preach the gospel.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.820]   Think about the countless number of hours that many of you put in to serve this church.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.500]   Is it all of that is for nothing?
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:19.060]   See, the central message, central reason why you and I are here is because of the resurrection.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.460]   Now, I'm not going to give you an apologetic presentation about the resurrection, because
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.340]   that's not the goal of this morning.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.820]   If you are interested in that subject, there are many books that you can read on that subject,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.960]   many apologetical, good scientific, rational reasoning behind why the resurrection.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.460]   We believe the resurrection.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.500]   But again, our point of this morning is not that.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.540]   We want to talk about the significance.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.900]   Why is the resurrection so important?
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.100]   And there's three things that I want to look at with you this morning.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.700]   One, the resurrection is significant because it proved that Jesus Christ was the Son of
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.700]   God.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.300]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:02.760]   Resurrection is pivotal because it proved that Jesus Christ was the Son of God.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.580]   In Romans 1, verse 4, it says, "Concerning his Son, who was descended from David according
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.900]   to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.140]   holiness by his resurrection from the dead."
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.500]   Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.420]   He said his resurrection was a public declaration of his identity.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:28.100]   See, Jesus Christ is not like other great men in history.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:34.620]   Buddhism comes, if you trace it all the way back, it comes from a man named Gautama.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.940]   He lived about 2,500 years ago.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.300]   And so there's various teachings about what he taught about afterlife, what he taught
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.700]   about this life.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.020]   But Gautama never professed to be God.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.000]   He was just observing life and wanted to find enlightenment.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.940]   But he himself never claimed to be God.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.580]   Muhammad, the Muslims believe that he was the last and the greatest prophet.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.380]   And so all of their faith rests upon his teachings.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.980]   But Muhammad himself has never claimed to be God.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.500]   Confucius, he was a great observer of life.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.180]   There's a lot of wisdom in his teaching.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.300]   But Confucius has never claimed to be God himself.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.420]   And we can go down the list of all the great men that are venerated in our culture, in
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.180]   our history.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:30.480]   They may have provided some help for mankind, some insight, some wisdom.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.260]   But none of them was crazy enough to say, "Well, I'm God.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.260]   Come and worship me."
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.500]   See, that's the difference between Jesus.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   Jesus was not just a great man.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.340]   He didn't just feed the poor.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.820]   He didn't just help people who were sick.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.980]   He claimed to be God himself.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.660]   So if we say that, "You know what?
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.460]   I believe in Jesus, but he did some great work."
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.900]   So you're talking about a man who claims to be God himself.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.940]   How can we venerate a man if he really wasn't that?
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.500]   Jesus says in the argument between the Pharisees, asking him, "How dare you confront us?"
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.820]   He claims a title.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.940]   He says, "Before Abraham was I Am."
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.420]   That term, that title, "I Am," was the same title that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.020]   to Moses.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.460]   And this is how he introduced himself.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.060]   He says, "I Am."
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.780]   So when Jesus says in the New Testament that he says, "Before Abraham was I Am," he's claiming
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.580]   the same name and same title of that God of the Old Testament.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.880]   And the Jews understood exactly what he was saying.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.220]   When they wanted to kill him, they said, "We're not killing you because of the deeds that
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.220]   you're doing.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:47.300]   We want to get rid of you because you, being a mere man, claim to be God."
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.980]   See Jesus didn't just come and do, was a good humanitarian.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.980]   Maybe he had some supernatural power, some prophet, and did some great work.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.540]   It wasn't just that.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.940]   He claimed to be God himself.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.480]   Jesus claimed in John chapter 10, 18 that no one could take his life.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.880]   Can you imagine any sane human being saying that?
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.200]   Nobody can take my life.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.000]   I lay it down and I take it up on my own.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.400]   Have you ever met any human being, no matter how powerful they are, say, "Nobody can kill
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   me."
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.480]   And even if I lay it down, I can get back up.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.720]   Who could do that but God himself?
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.620]   So you can imagine when some people heard that, they said, "This guy's crazy."
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.360]   But they didn't know what to do with him.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.520]   Now if it was just any man saying that, it's like, "Oh, he's crazy."
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   If somebody stood up here and said, "You know what?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   If I die, I'm going to come back."
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.780]   It's like, "He's crazy.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.780]   He's smoking something."
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.260]   Right?
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.100]   But they didn't know what to do with him because he was clearly not an ordinary man.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.840]   They saw him open the eyes of the people who were blind.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.520]   They saw him calm the storm.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.880]   They saw him feed thousands of people miraculously.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.960]   He performed miracles after miracles.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.480]   So he wasn't just an average human being claiming these things.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.420]   He was, seemed like a powerful prophet, and they were fine with him being a powerful prophet,
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.300]   but now that he's claiming to be God, what do we do with this guy?
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.680]   And he says, not only that, I think one of the greatest statements, one of the clearest
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.280]   statements of his deity is in John chapter 5.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   He talks about how the father is worshipped, and so the son ought to be worshipped as well.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.360]   You remember scenes in the Bible where even angels would, you know, if they bowed down
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.700]   to the wrong person or wrong God, I mean, they would be punished.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.480]   So that's why any time you see in the Old Testament or the New Testament where people
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.560]   even make gesture of worship, they would stop him.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   It's like, "Don't do that.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.700]   I'm a man just like you.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.500]   Only God can be worshipped.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:56.360]   So not only would you be blaspheming, I will be a blasphemer by receiving your worship."
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.840]   But Jesus says, as the father is honored and worshipped, the son is honored and worshipped.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.680]   He places himself with equal honor as God the Father.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:15.080]   Now either he is crazy, or if he really is, what do we do with this man?
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:21.600]   So Jesus said, they asked him, "With what authority are you saying these things?"
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.540]   He came and cleansed the temple, and they were like, "What are you doing?
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   How dare you do this?
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.240]   Where do you get the authority?"
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.100]   And Jesus says in John 2, 19, "Destroy this temple, and on the third day, I will raise
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   it back up."
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.720]   Now obviously he was referring to his resurrection.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   Again, he was having a conversation with people, with the Pharisees, and they asked him, "Show
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   us a sign.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.080]   I mean, you're doing some great works, but we need to see something bigger than that.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   Show us a sign."
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.700]   Jesus says, "A wicked and evil generation, I will give no sign but the sign of Jonah."
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.400]   And again, the sign of Jonah, referring to his death and resurrection on the third day.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.880]   So Jesus himself said, "If you see me come back from the dead on the third day, then
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:09.400]   you will know that what I said to you was true, that I am who I said I am."
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.360]   And so the day that we celebrate his resurrection, everything that we believe, everything that
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.480]   we practice, everything that we study, rises and falls on your conviction, my conviction,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.720]   of the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.880]   If you are sitting here in this room and you're not sure if you really believe this, that's
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.040]   where you ought to start.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.680]   Before you start talking about, "I need to go to church more often, I need to attend
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.960]   Bible study, maybe I should pray more."
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.720]   If your personal conviction about the resurrection isn't solid, and you're not convicted about,
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.600]   "I guess I believe it or don't believe it."
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:52.780]   See, a lackadaisical conviction of this will overflow in a lackadaisical application in
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.360]   our life.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.160]   Christianity rises and falls on this event.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.740]   And obviously, you and I, or many of us are here because we believe that this to be true.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.560]   Either Jesus Christ was a crazy man, or he really was the Son of God.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.380]   If he really was the Son of God, what does that mean?
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.380]   What does it mean for us?
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:22.080]   If he really was risen from the dead, and we believe what he says, what does that mean?
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.940]   That leads us to the second point.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.280]   The second reason why the resurrection is so important is a lot more personal.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.960]   The resurrection of Jesus paved the way for our resurrection one day.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.280]   He conquered death, that we may also conquer death.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.760]   See, the Scripture clearly says, Scripture clearly says that because mankind sinned against
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.480]   God, death came into mankind.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   See, let me illustrate it this way to help us understand.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.160]   People just naturally think, you know, most of the people that you talk on the street,
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.480]   if you ask them, "Do you believe in heaven and hell?"
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.920]   You know, some of them will say, "Yeah, I believe.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.920]   I believe in heaven.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.920]   I'm not sure if I believe in hell."
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.000]   And you ask them, "Do you think you're going to go to heaven?"
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.120]   And they say, "Yeah, I think so."
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.960]   Because most people believe that they're good enough.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.220]   My father came to the United States in 1974.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.480]   And I was a small child, and he came here first.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.240]   And then he had to stay here for a year.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.420]   Typically, when somebody is invited to come to the US, you have to have somebody with
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.300]   legal status invite you.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.800]   So he came here first in 1974 as a student.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.760]   And so for a year, he had to establish himself and get legal status.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.720]   And he got a job, and he changed his visa.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.200]   And once he had legal status, he was able to invite his family to come.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.720]   Imagine if somebody stepped up and said, you know, they came to the border, you know, and
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.280]   they're in the immigration office, and they said, "You know what?
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.880]   I think I deserve to get in."
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   Right?
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.600]   Imagine what response you would get.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.480]   Imagine next time you go out of the country, or you go to some other country that requires
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.760]   a visa, just imagine walking up there and saying, "I'm coming in."
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   Like why?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.560]   Because I'm a good person.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   Like what authority?
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.560]   I invited you.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   Well, I invited myself.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   Right?
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.040]   See, we naturally think, like, if we die, if I did good enough stuff, I'm going to get
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   in.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   Right?
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   Let me illustrate it another way.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.400]   Typically, if somebody is going to get invited here, if you have a criminal record in your
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.760]   country, you're not going to be invited.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   They're not.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.160]   They're going to look at it as soon as they see a criminal record and say, "Okay, immigration
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.800]   denied."
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.120]   Imagine if you came to the immigration office and you said, "You know what?
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.480]   I know I have this record and I was in prison for a couple years, but every Saturday I fed
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   the homeless.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.280]   For two years I fed the homeless.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.200]   So that should kind of, my good I think outweighs the bad.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   So I should get in."
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   Right?
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.240]   Now, I know some of you guys are smirking because you know how ridiculous that sounds.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.800]   But when you actually think through it, heaven is not, we don't own heaven.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.840]   Right?
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.920]   Heaven is a place where it's His kingdom.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.520]   And so the scripture clearly says, "No one who has been tainted with sin can enter."
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.560]   But the problem is, you and I, a lot of people don't think, "Well, I haven't been tainted.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.680]   You know, I know my good outweighs the bad."
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.540]   You know, this morning, I don't know, yesterday, those of you guys who are watching March Madness
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.080]   and four teams played and there's only two teams left, right?
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   Am I right?
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.920]   Yesterday, there was a big game between Kentucky and Wisconsin and a lot of people thought
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.080]   that Kentucky was going to win.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.720]   They've never lost a game the whole year.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.600]   And they thought if they win just two more games, they'd have a perfect record.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   Right?
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.320]   Well, yesterday, they lost to a lesser team, Wisconsin.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:43.240]   And one of the team members of Kentucky, you know, who was obviously upset, Andrew Harrison
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240]   was his name.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.520]   And some of you guys who've been watching the news and following March Madness may know
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.520]   what happened.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.960]   While he was being interviewed, he said some racial slur against another team member in
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   Kentucky.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.520]   He was an African-American guy and he was saying some derogatory stuff about the Caucasian
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.760]   basketball player on Wisconsin.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.840]   Well, he was just mumbling this to his teammate and the mic picked it up.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.960]   And so he's in huge trouble now.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   Right?
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.680]   So he's tweeting, "I'm sorry."
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.440]   You know, it was poor choice of words.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   He's apologizing.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.060]   Oh, if you go to talk radio or if you go to ESPN right now, that's the talk right now.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.880]   What are they going to do with this guy?
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.040]   You know, they're talking about he's supposed to go into NBA next year.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.680]   So is it going to affect his career?
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.720]   What team is going to want to pick this guy up?
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.440]   And he just basically, that one simple statement, he blew it.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.960]   And obviously he's repenting.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.480]   He's sorry about what he did.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:42.600]   But just imagine if that mic that picked up his mumbling followed him everywhere he went.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   Right?
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.660]   Let's make it broader.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.460]   What if that mic followed you wherever you went?
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:55.020]   Everything that you said in private to your wife, to your husband, to your friends, to
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.380]   your close companions about other people, everything that you've ever said was picked
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.500]   up by this mic.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.940]   How many of you will be in the same position as that guy?
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.300]   Let me put it another way.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.900]   You know, we have some friends who went up north.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.940]   They planted a church.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.900]   And I remember when they first got up there, they were kind of like, they were almost in
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.780]   fear.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.820]   Because down here we have traffic cameras.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.980]   We have traffic cameras, but it's just kind of all over the place.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.700]   But we know where they are.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.700]   It's not that prevalent.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:31.180]   But in San Francisco, found out that some of you guys who are from San Francisco know
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.180]   this.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.500]   They have a lot of cameras hanging everywhere.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.960]   And so I remember one of our church members that went up there, and I think within the
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.660]   first month or two, they were getting tickets.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.380]   You know, because the pictures being taken, and these weren't cheap tickets.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.100]   They were not making a full stop and making a right turn.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.660]   And basically it was running a red light.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.420]   Those of you guys who know what it costs to run a red light, I know very well how much
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.420]   that costs.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   Right?
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420]   Don't do that.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.420]   It's over 400 bucks.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.060]   And so they were getting this ticket, and it's like, what?
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.300]   You know, you almost feel violated when you get a ticket like that.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.780]   It's like, because you don't remember doing anything.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.900]   And then all of a sudden they show you a picture.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.540]   This is when you did it.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.540]   Right?
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.340]   Imagine if there was a camera everywhere you went.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.260]   And they took picture every time you went above the speed limit.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.660]   Every time you made a right turn without making a complete stop.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.100]   We would be bankrupt today.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.540]   Right?
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.220]   Especially me.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.660]   Right?
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:38.260]   See what if, we imagine the guy who's in charge of immigration up in heaven was an
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.940]   omnipotent, omnipresent being.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.180]   See, that's exactly what the scripture says.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:48.580]   See, we think that if we didn't get caught, we're innocent.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.180]   If we don't have a police record, we're innocent.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.660]   But what if the God that we serve, as the scripture says, is omniscient?
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.740]   He knows all things.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.900]   He knows every time you thought something evil.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.540]   Every time you violated the law.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.540]   Every time you spoke evil of someone else.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.700]   He knew about it.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.380]   And you were guilty.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.340]   In Psalm 139, 7-12, the psalmist says, "Where shall I go from your spirit?
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.260]   Or where shall I flee from your presence?
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.140]   If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.020]   If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.920]   If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.340]   your hand shall lead me and your right hand shall hold me.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:33.340]   If I say surely the darkness shall cover me and the light about me be night.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.820]   Even the darkness is not dark to you.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:41.380]   The night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you."
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:50.180]   Now, if you are a lawbreaker, you don't want the police.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.260]   The presence of the police will make you nervous.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:58.260]   If you're trying to hide something, as soon as the police pulls you over, you know what
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.260]   I mean?
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.260]   It's like, "Oh shoot, what did I do?"
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.580]   All of a sudden, you're on your best behavior.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:14.820]   People who only know God as the law coordinator, the law giver, the presence of God is not
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.100]   welcomed.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.660]   There's a sense of fear to know that this omniscient, omnipotent God, who knows every
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:27.780]   thought that you have, that He's going to determine at the end of your life what you
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.240]   deserve and don't deserve.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.460]   That is a fearful thought.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:42.580]   Any human being who begins to contemplate and understands this should tremble in fear.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.840]   The scripture makes it very clear in Romans 3.10, "None is righteous, no, not one.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.140]   No one understands, no one seeks God.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.340]   All have turned aside, together they have become worthless.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.740]   No one does good, not even one."
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.940]   And Romans 3.23, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.380]   See, that's the condition of all mankind.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.980]   See, but that's where the resurrection is so important to us.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.700]   See, Christ, the scripture says that Christ came and He took on human form.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.260]   He walked on earth and He lived a sinless life and He became the perfect sacrifice for
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.780]   us.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:25.140]   And when He was resurrected from the dead, He provided hope for mankind.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.180]   And Galatians 3.13-14 says, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.980]   curse for us."
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.200]   All mankind was under this curse and Pastor Mark did a great job this Friday explaining
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.340]   that to us, expositing that.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.700]   All mankind is under this curse, but it says, "He became a curse for us, for it is written,
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.220]   'Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree.'"
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:58.060]   Let me explain this in this way to kind of help us understand what this day represents.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:04.460]   Ever since the fall of mankind, you and I have been reacting against everything that
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   has happened to us.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.020]   So whenever you go to a counselor or psychologist and you explain to them what's going on in
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.380]   your life, they're going to ask you, "Well, what happened to you?
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380]   Why are you abusive?"
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.780]   And they'll say, "Well, my parents were abusive."
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.180]   And they'll say, "Okay, that's why you're doing that, but you've traced it back and
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.940]   said, 'Oh, why were your parents abusive?'
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.420]   It's because they were abused."
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.260]   Or maybe you're an alcoholic and you go to a counselor and say, "Well, what happened?
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.440]   Well, my dad was an alcoholic.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.380]   So why was he an alcoholic?"
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.420]   And they trace it back and they'll say, "Well, your grandparents were alcoholics."
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:41.460]   And so every single person who was born into this sinful world is reacting against a sin
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.020]   that was committed against us.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:49.020]   And if you've been kicked, you're going to kick.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.860]   And the people who kicked you are kicking you because they've been kicked.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.620]   And the people who kicked them are kicking because they've been kicked.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:02.600]   So generationally, one generation after another generation, sin is spiraling out of control.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.380]   And all psychology can do is to tell you, "This is why you behave the way you behave."
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.180]   And so, we're kind of like, "Oh, okay, that's why I did it."
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.140]   But here's the problem.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.820]   So what?
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.620]   So how is that going to prevent you from, if you've been kicked, how is it going to
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.140]   prevent you from being that way?
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.380]   So all of us has a tendency to react when we're sinned against.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.260]   And so we sin.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.980]   But here's where this resurrection comes in.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.260]   Every single person, if I slap you, you're going to slap me or you're going to slap somebody
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.100]   else.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:43.100]   Jesus Christ came and instead, He was sinned against and He absorbed the sin.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:48.780]   Not only did He absorb the sin, He resurrects and He pushes back.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.260]   So from that moment on, the curse is broken.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:29:00.700]   So no man who has been affected by His death and resurrection can say, "I do this because
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.980]   this was done to me."
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:09.340]   From that moment on, we say, "I do this because He absorbed my sin."
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.620]   So I'm able to absorb your sin.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.460]   And so now the curse is reversed.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.940]   And now that's what the Scripture says.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.100]   We are saved and we are being saved.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.820]   And that's what the resurrection signifies to us.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.620]   It is the reverse of the curse that mankind is in.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.420]   That now we can live a new life.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.260]   See, in 1 Corinthians 15, 20 it says, "But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead,
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.420]   the first fruit of those who have fallen asleep."
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:43.420]   See, Jesus Christ, His resurrection means that He paved a way for our resurrection.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.020]   Prior to Him, every man who died would have come under judgment.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:53.460]   But now, everyone who confesses Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and your sins are forgiven,
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.620]   the curse has been reversed.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.100]   The third and final thing is a lot more personal.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:03.140]   See, our hope of the resurrection isn't simply about the future, it's about today.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.220]   It's not simply that when I die, I'm going to go to heaven.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.180]   But it's our hope for today.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.500]   You know, when I was younger, you know, I didn't live in California, so until a certain
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.900]   age I've never met an Asian American who spoke English, other than my brothers.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.820]   You know, so my parents came to the US in 1975 to Philadelphia.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:27.340]   I'm pretty sure we were the only Asians there, so if they said "Chinaman" or whatever, you
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.860]   know, they said, we just assumed it was me.
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.860]   You know, or we went to Kansas and it was even worse.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.220]   I've never, you know, I've never seen any ethnic group.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.140]   And so I didn't even know it existed, like other Asians who could speak English existed.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.140]   And then we went to Atlanta and it was like each year it got worse.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:50.620]   And then I thought if I went to Korea, things would get better, but it wasn't any better
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.060]   there either, you know.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:57.580]   But when we were younger, if you were Asian American, the only reference that they had
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.940]   was either Bruce Lee, and some of you guys, most of you guys don't know this, have you
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   ever seen Bonanza?
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.940]   Just like a dead silence.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   Okay, a couple of you may have seen it.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.780]   Yes, thank you.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:18.100]   So either you had two references, either you were Bruce Lee or you were Hop Singh from
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.660]   Bonanza and he was the cook.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.580]   And he's the guy who had the typical Chinese ponytail, you know, is walking around and
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.580]   serving people.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.500]   So if you were cool, you're Bruce Lee, right?
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.740]   And if you didn't know Kung Fu, then you're Hop Singh, right?
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.100]   So obviously all the Asian people wanted to be, you know, Bruce Lee, so we were like,
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   "Hiya!"
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.860]   You know, even if we didn't know anything about karate or anything, it's like you wanted
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.860]   to be related to Bruce Lee.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.980]   You know, Bruce Lee, there's been a resurgence of popularity of Bruce Lee and there's this
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.540]   videotape of him being interviewed and they ask him about his philosophy and Kung Fu and
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.540]   all that.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.420]   And you probably heard this before, but this is what he says, right?
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.100]   "Empty your mind.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.820]   Be formless, shapeless, like water."
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:06.020]   Like that's how he says it, right?
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.260]   I was going to say the whole thing in his voice, but I don't want to distract from the
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:14.420]   message, okay?
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.900]   Now I can't read it, all right.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.660]   If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.700]   You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.000]   You put it in a teapot, it becomes a teapot.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.540]   Now water can flow or it can crash.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.260]   Be water, my friend.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.420]   Anybody remember that clip?
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.260]   Okay, so a lot of you guys remember that clip.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.060]   And you say, "Oh, it's so wise.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.060]   Be water.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.060]   We've got to be like water."
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.060]   Isn't that even biblical?
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.180]   Doesn't Paul say, "Be all things to all people"?
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.620]   That's what it sounds like, right?
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.140]   That's biblical.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.380]   Be water, my friend.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:59.300]   Now that sounds great, but what if you're a potato?
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:04.300]   How do you just decide to become water?
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.220]   How do you just, "Okay, I'm going to be water."
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.220]   How?
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.900]   I mean, that sounds great, but there's no way to get there.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:18.020]   You know, that Buddhist friend that I was talking to, he was saying, like, one of the
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:25.100]   things that central teachings, why people don't attain higher enlightenment is because
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.100]   of attachment.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.740]   And what he meant by that is being attached to anything prevents you from higher enlightenment
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:36.020]   because your lust, your desire for material, your desire for fame, all of these things
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.380]   hold you back.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.900]   So he says the key thing of Buddhism is detachment, right?
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.140]   Well, that sounds a lot like Christianity.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.580]   It's like, "Do not love the world or anything in the world," right?
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.900]   And I said, "That sounds wise.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.060]   That sounds great, but how?
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.180]   How do you do that?
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.060]   How do you detach yourself from these things?"
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.540]   It's just like telling a hungry person, "You know, I have a solution to your hunger.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.540]   Stop."
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:07.420]   Like, "I'm so hungry.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.180]   I need to eat."
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.180]   Stop it, right?
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.820]   That's basically what it's saying.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.380]   Okay, here's the problem.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.140]   Stop doing that, right?
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.420]   You want to be like water.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.580]   But how do you do that?
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.020]   So it may sound like wisdom, but all it leads to is frustration.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.820]   Here's a goal that you can't possibly attain.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.980]   See, Christianity is not about, like, rules of life, and if you follow these rules, somehow
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.820]   you're going to find attainment, and you're going to find fulfillment.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.820]   That's not it at all.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.380]   In fact, the scripture says exactly the opposite.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.420]   The law was given to us so that you and I would recognize, "Here's what you need to
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.020]   have to get into heaven, and you can't get there."
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:53.220]   Yes, you need to be like water, but how?
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.660]   It's the attachment to the things that are destroying us, but how do you get detached
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.340]   from that?
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.700]   You know what the scripture says?
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.540]   You know what the resurrection is?
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.720]   People who are attached, people who see where we need to be and can't get there.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.280]   You know how do you get a hungry person to not hunger for things that are wrong?
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.960]   Feed him with what's good.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   Feed him with what's good.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.940]   You can't just tell him, "Stop being hungry."
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.940]   Feed him.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:28.900]   See, the scripture tells us that Christ came, and he reversed a curse, and he gave us eternal
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.460]   hope, so the scripture isn't simply telling us, "Stop loving the world."
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.120]   He says, "No, if you are filled with Christ, you will no longer love the world."
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.580]   Our safety is not in the world.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.680]   Our peace is not in the world.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.560]   The world is never going to quench my thirst.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.720]   Jesus quenches my thirst.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.800]   The hunger that we have, he doesn't just say, "Stop hungering."
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.560]   He says, "No, fix your eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith."
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.400]   When the scripture says that Jesus came to bring life and bring this life abundantly,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   the word he uses there is "zoe."
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.280]   A lot of people think that salvation means that I'm going to live forever, but that's
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.200]   not the word he uses.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.240]   See, there's two words for life in the Bible.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.000]   One is "bios," the other one is "zoe."
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.680]   Bios is the word where if you breathe, you eat, you sleep, you get up.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.080]   That's bios.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.900]   Everybody has bios.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.040]   Even after we die, the Bible says the soul doesn't disintegrate.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.780]   We live forever.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.880]   The word Jesus uses here is "zoe."
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:35.000]   "Zoe" is equivalent to the word we would use to say we are alive.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.960]   We were at one point dead.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.400]   We were existing, but we were dead in spirit.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.040]   But Jesus Christ came and he made us alive in him.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:52.140]   See, our source, our power, and our life is when we are connected to the living water.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.880]   So Jesus didn't just come and say, "Hey, now you don't die.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   You're going to live forever."
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   Right?
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.760]   That's what a lot of people don't understand.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.040]   It's like, "Well, I don't know if I want to be forever."
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.240]   But that's not what he meant.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.200]   He meant that that which died because of sin, because of his absorption, he allowed us and
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.760]   he freed us.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.520]   So our life is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.240]   In 1 Peter 1.3 it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.280]   According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again and to a living hope through
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.840]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:32.080]   See, a person who does not recognize Jesus as a living water and Jesus as a living bread
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.640]   will never understand what salvation is.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.040]   It is not simply getting rid of the penalty of sin.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.560]   Jesus Christ came to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.920]   So when we feel the most alive, when genuine Christians feel the most alive is when you
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.360]   are the closest in connection with Christ.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   That's why we worship.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   That's why we come.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.920]   And so, you know, the things that you're excited about, you end up talking about.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   Right?
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.560]   You guys here who are watching the final four and there's final two now, there's going
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.400]   to be, I guarantee you, once this is over, there's going to be some conversation about
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   that.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.920]   Pacquiao and Meriwether fight is going to happen in May 2nd.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.920]   Right?
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.080]   There's going to be some conversation about that after this.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.320]   Right?
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.920]   Because we're interested about it.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   We're excited about it.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.120]   I'm excited about it.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   Right?
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   Whatever it is that you're excited about, you're going to end up talking about.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   Right?
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.360]   And when you talk about it, there's somebody who says, "Hey, how come you're not talking
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   about Pacquiao today?
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.640]   How come you're not talking about the final four today?"
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.520]   Anybody ever confront you about that?
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.440]   In fact, it's all the, "Hey, you've got something better to talk about than this."
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   Right?
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.960]   We feel almost guilty about talking about it too much.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   Evangelism happens when people are living in Christ.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:59.000]   When we are alive, when you recognize the life that we have in Christ, you tell somebody
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.200]   who's been affected by the cross to tell them to stop talking about Jesus.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.960]   All those people in the Middle East, all they have to say is, "I don't believe in Jesus,"
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.380]   and they'll live.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.760]   You try to get them to stop talking about Jesus.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.320]   Those pastors that we met in India, they're risking their lives, their lives and their
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   family's lives.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.040]   You tell them to stop preaching Jesus.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.760]   They can't.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.840]   Because they found new life in Christ.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.480]   See, that's what the resurrection signifies.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:34.360]   It's not just that our old self has died, but our new self has been resurrected with
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   Christ.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.160]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.280]   You know, before I met Christ, I was so lost.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:49.080]   You know, we had ten brothers and sisters give their testimony this morning at the early
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   rise service.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.800]   And honestly, I could hear that all day long.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.080]   It is food to my soul.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.040]   You know, hearing how God is working in your life.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.280]   And every single person, every single Christian has a genuine testimony.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.200]   I was no different.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.480]   I was so lost.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:13.800]   You know, like by the time that I got into, I think I counted maybe about 11 different
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.920]   schools, from first grade to 12th grade.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.000]   I went to 11 different schools.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.560]   So, you know, usually I would go to a new school and typically, it's like, "Hey, Chinaman,"
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   or whatever.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   You know, it usually starts with that.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:32.320]   And then my two brothers, they're kind of, they're more meek and gentle and patient.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.640]   You know, so they just kind of tick it, but not me.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   Right?
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   If I hear Ching Chung something, I'm going to do something about it.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.640]   Right?
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.520]   So every school I went into, I started, sometimes, I got in a fight the very first day I was
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.520]   at school.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520]   That was my record.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   Right?
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.440]   So first day, second day, eventually I ended up fighting somebody.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.440]   And then, because I usually made friends by fighting somebody, so the friends that I made
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.200]   were people who thought that was cool.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.020]   So you can imagine, you know, these were not the straight-A students.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.020]   You know?
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.360]   So that's the crowd I ended up, and then, as soon as I felt comfortable, we ended up
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   moving.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.080]   When I was younger, I didn't really think much about that, because you're young, you
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.920]   just kind of go wherever the parents went.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   So the first time I really like felt that, the impact of the move, was right when I was
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   hitting puberty.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.160]   You know, going from sixth grade to seventh grade.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.680]   My parents moved back out to Korea, and I got really close to this friend.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   And to be honest, when my parents said they were going to go back to the U.S., I said,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   "Oh, okay.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   You know, we're moving."
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Like before.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.840]   But my friend took it so hard.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.280]   The first time I really became good friends with somebody, and the moment I told him,
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.200]   until I left, I mean, he cried the whole time.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.960]   And I remember at the airport, he was like screaming.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.360]   And obviously that made me sad, and I was crying, and then we got on the plane.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.720]   And you have to remember, at that time, if you moved to a different country, I mean,
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   basically you write letters.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.520]   The phone calls cost way too much.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.720]   And I knew I probably would never see this guy again.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   You know?
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.160]   It's not like today.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:09.560]   Like Pastor Alex went to China, I'm talking to him more now than he was when he was here.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.080]   So by the time we came back to the U.S., I mean, I was completely, completely like lost.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.920]   And I thought, you know, when I came here, I said, "Oh, I'm Korean."
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.600]   So when we went back to Korea, they told me, "Go back to your country."
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   What?
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   I'm Korean.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   Right?
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.720]   They said, "No, you're an American."
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   You know?
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.280]   So I felt completely lost.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   Am I Korean?
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   Am I American?
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.080]   I don't know anybody who's Asian, who speaks English.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.200]   And so, again, right around puberty, right around, you know, seventh grade, and that
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.520]   completely messed me up.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   When I met Christ in 1983, my world got just flipped upside down.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.560]   Every anger, every bitterness, I felt so lost.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.520]   I didn't know where I belonged.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.160]   And I took it out, you know, every little thing just would set me off.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   I would be angry.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.600]   My biggest problem was like I had a bad temper, and I would just, any little thing that I
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.040]   felt offended by, I would get in a fight.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.840]   1983, you know, we go up to a retreat, and I see a bunch of people who are praying, and
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.240]   you know, I grew up in a Christian home.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   We prayed all the time.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.800]   But there's these guys who were praying, they were all my age people, and they were praying,
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.840]   they were praying like God's actually listening.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   And that was strange to me.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.160]   It was just because to me it was just a ritual, because I didn't understand.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.480]   But they were crying out to God, and say, "Is there something that I don't get?"
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.440]   If you asked me at that time, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.640]   I would say, "Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   Of course, my dad's a pastor.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.120]   How can I not be a Christian?"
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.840]   But I never gave it serious thought, other than that, until that day.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.560]   I got on my knees and I prayed, "God, if you're real, open my eyes."
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.000]   And I'm not going to go into too much detail, but that's when I met the Lord.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.320]   And when I met the Lord, for the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:02.600]   And it wasn't in America, it wasn't in Korea, it wasn't with other Asian Americans.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.160]   It was as His child.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:12.120]   I got citizenship in eternity, and I belonged somewhere.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.600]   And this life, this emptiness that I felt, thinking that if I did this and had this,
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.080]   and only if my life was different, only if we didn't move around so much, only if my
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:25.240]   parents weren't pastors, only if we had more money, all these things that I thought would
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:31.120]   fix my life, the moment I met Christ, all of that got answered instantaneously.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:37.360]   And I knew that everything that happened in my life, God did to bring me to that point.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:44.280]   And that's the day that I made a decision, "This is the reason why I'm going to live."
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:51.520]   And I can honestly tell you that 1983 was my new birth.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.320]   And I know a lot of people say, "Well, you know, it happened gradually."
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.760]   And people come to Christ in different ways, but for me, it was instantaneous.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:03.640]   So it was so vivid to me what the world looked like before I met Christ and what the world
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.800]   looked like after I met Christ.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:12.640]   What the world was like before the resurrection, what the world was like after the resurrection.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   I pray with all my heart that not a single person in this room, whether you've been attending
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.040]   church all your life and you've just been assuming your faith, or maybe you're here
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:27.520]   because somebody invited you because they wanted you to hear the Gospel message, that
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:34.960]   not a single person in this room would miss the greatest gift that mankind has ever been
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.440]   given in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.560]   That you would consider deeply what this means.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:48.620]   If Jesus Christ was actually risen from the dead, what does that mean?
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:54.740]   If this Jesus that we sing, that we talk about every single week, if he really was the Son
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.200]   of God, what does that mean?
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.080]   How does that change your life?
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.200]   How does that change your future?
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.900]   How does that change what you value?
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.000]   How does that change your death?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.360]   I pray with all my heart this morning that at least we would consider deeply, that we
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.540]   would not simply be churchgoers, that we would not just be happy with the fact that we've
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:24.560]   just put up our name on a list, but that we are true disciples of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.680]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up at this time, and I'm going to invite all
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   of you.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:36.760]   Again, I know we do this often, but as we think carefully about the resurrection of
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:45.240]   Jesus Christ, I think the people that I feel the most, I don't know if the word is compassion,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:51.160]   but people who are like me, you know, live their whole life just assuming that they know
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.680]   Jesus, just because you were raised in the church.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.360]   And you can repay, if I ask you any biblical question, you might be able to give me the
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.960]   right answers, but you don't know Jesus.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.140]   You don't have a personal relationship with Christ.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:13.480]   The resurrection is a historical event that affects Christianity, but not you personally.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:20.400]   It's just important on paper, but not in reality, because you don't know Jesus.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.880]   The greatest tragedy is for somebody to be in church all their life and then meet the
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.000]   resurrected Christ and he says, "I never knew you.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.320]   These are not my words.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.360]   Jesus said that."
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.560]   I pray that as we think upon the resurrection of Christ and what it means, that you would
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.960]   make it personal.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.240]   Don't be satisfied with saying, "Oh, it means this for Christianity."
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.400]   What does it mean to you?
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.760]   When Jesus asked the question, "What do the people say that I am?"
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   "Oh, you're the prophet.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   You know, you're John.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   You're this, you're that."
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.040]   But what do you say?
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.680]   Who do you say I am?
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.240]   That's the same question that we need to answer.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.180]   Who is Jesus?
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.440]   Do you know this resurrected Christ?
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.760]   And I pray for those of you who are sitting here who came as guests and maybe you've never
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:11.200]   heard the gospel or maybe you heard it before, but you just heard it as just knowledge.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.920]   You never really thought of it as your own personal savior.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.800]   I want to welcome you this afternoon.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.080]   And again, I'm not going to ask you to come out.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.340]   I'm just going to ask you to sit quietly.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:26.600]   You don't have to repeat, you know, some religious ritualistic words when you come to God.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.780]   You could talk to him like you talk to anybody else.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.780]   Just be honest with him.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.040]   Say, "God, if you're real, I want to know you.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.560]   If you really did die for me on the cross and you're offering me a new life and you
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.720]   want to forgive my sins, I want to receive you."
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.000]   Just make an honest prayer.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.360]   You can, you don't have to use fancy vocabulary.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.880]   You don't need to know any theology.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.480]   You just honestly want to come before God.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   God, if just like I did, I was just curious.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.320]   Are you real?
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:02.840]   I invite you to take some time as we pray that again, every single one of us, that this
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.360]   is not just another resurrection Sunday that we're just going to chalk off and say, "Okay,
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.800]   now it's my seventh or eighth or ninth or tenth."
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.040]   But the reality of his resurrection would make a deep impact on each one of us.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.080]   So let's take some time to pray as we welcome the worship team to lead us.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.200]   [MUSIC]
