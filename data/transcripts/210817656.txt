[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Okay, all right.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   Well let us take a moment to turn our Bibles over to 1 Peter chapter 5, verse 1 through
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.320]   4.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.640]   And I'll read the section for us.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680]   We'll pray and jump into our study for tonight, okay?
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.280]   It says, "Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.640]   suffering of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.800]   the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily according
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.680]   to the will of God, not for sword gain, but with eagerness.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.300]   Nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.340]   to the flock, and when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340]   of glory."
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.340]   Amen.
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.340]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.160]   All right, God, we want to ask again, Lord, that you would truly by your Spirit enlighten
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.580]   our eyes, that you would move in our hearts so that both our affection, our commitment,
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.720]   and our minds would really draw near to your word.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.580]   Father, we are praying that as we talk today about church, the leadership, ministry, I
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.900]   ask, Lord, that you grant to us just a great vision of what you are doing, Lord.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.900]   Amen.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.780]   I'm going to give a silly introduction.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.880]   So have you guys seen that TV show, The Dog Whisperer, Cesar Millan, who does an amazing
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.380]   job imitating dogs, but he also does an amazing job basically transforming troublesome pets,
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.580]   troublesome dogs.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.660]   So you've got this wild like chihuahua or whatever who's like, "Brrr."
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.260]   And then the owner is so sad, and every time I watch those episodes, you know, owners are
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.180]   crying and me not being a pet person, I'm just like, "Why?
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.340]   Why would you put yourself through that?"
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.700]   Well, anyway, the owner is all crying and wondering, "Should I let go of my animal
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.700]   or not?
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.020]   Should I give it one last try?
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.020]   Call Cesar Millan."
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.260]   So Cesar Millan shows up and the dog is all crazy.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.420]   He like bites people.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.660]   He yarps and yells and barks and all that stuff.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.220]   And the owner is like, "See, I can't handle this anymore."
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.660]   And then Cesar Millan comes over and it's like, you know, and the dog is just like,
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.180]   and everything's like crazy, like transformation immediately.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.220]   And I think that's the draw of the whole TV show, right?
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.020]   Because after you watch one, like every episode is the same.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.540]   But anyway, what ends up happening is there's a moment when Cesar Millan looks at the dog
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.500]   and he's like, "Oh, he's just been X, Y, and Z, and he needs to be in this pack."
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.620]   And then he goes, "But you have to be a good pack leader," right?
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.660]   And he's like, "Why aren't you calm and assertive?
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.020]   And why aren't you being a good leader?"
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020]   Right?
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.620]   Well, here's an interesting thing is we've been talking about, you know, congregation,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.460]   congregations, should I say.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.060]   Because remember he's addressing flocks in different areas, different regions of Macedonia,
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.380]   different regions of Asia.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.140]   And he says to these churches, you know, in the midst of your suffering, and he had said
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.580]   a lot, and we studied a lot, everything from this is your great gospel you have, this is
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.020]   the preciousness of the truth you have, and the great salvation you have.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.780]   You know, this is the high calling of God in the midst of your suffering.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.180]   This is God's purpose for you.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.580]   This is what God is doing, and all this kind of stuff, right?
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.820]   But then here in chapter 5, he says, "Therefore," and then he looks at the elders, and he says,
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.660]   "I charge you.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.220]   I exhort you," right?
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.780]   And here and now we come to this portion where the exhortation of Apostle Peter is very,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.780]   very strong and emphatic.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.020]   As a matter of fact, in some of your translations it might be a little bit different.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.660]   The first point we're looking at is his exhortation, and the NIV says like, "I appeal to you,"
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.660]   you know?
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.660]   In some translations, "I urge you."
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.700]   The NASB, the one I'm studying off of, will say, "I exhort you," you know?
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.020]   And what is this command?
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.420]   It's to shepherd the flock among you.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.780]   So this passage was kind of an interesting passage to study, and in many ways as I'm
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.700]   studying and I'm preaching at myself, you know?
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.100]   But I just want to introduce it by saying there is a time when as Apostle Peter is addressing
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.100]   the congregation, here and now it's very clear he's addressing the leadership, right?
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.500]   And in so doing, he's going to give various commands, but we could all benefit from learning.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.260]   As he's explaining the task at hand, as he's explaining how they're supposed to lead, we
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.640]   actually get an exhortation for all of us that we, as we participate in the ministry
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.540]   of God's kingdom, what kind of attitude, you know, what we're buying into, what kind of
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.780]   tasks God has given to the church, or maybe even specifically to the leadership of the
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.740]   church, that we might not go against it, but that we might be fully engaged into the work
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.060]   of ministry, okay?
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.220]   So let's take a look here again.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.060]   He says, "Therefore I exhort you, the elders among you, as your fellow elder, witnesses
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.180]   of the sufferings of Christ, and partake also of the glory that is revealed, shepherd the
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.180]   flock of God among you," right?
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.860]   That's what it had said.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.500]   Now here's one of the questions that I'd asked you to do was to look at the passage and ask,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.380]   "Hmm, what is the characteristic, the character traits of a good shepherd?"
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.460]   Right?
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.500]   And actually there's a lot to glean even just from verse 1 and that first little section
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.460]   of verse 2, the command itself.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.100]   Let's take a look really quick.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.780]   The first element that I observe is this, "A good shepherd must understand," sorry,
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.420]   "A good shepherd understands the common witness and hope of all saints, but understands the
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.580]   weight of his responsibility."
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.220]   Okay?
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.820]   So the first element of a good shepherd that I observed just from verse 1 is that a good
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.020]   shepherd understands the common witness and hope of all saints, but understands the weight
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.340]   of his responsibility.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.260]   He understands that what has been delegated to him is a great, serious exhortation.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260]   It's an incredible stewardship.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.700]   It is to shepherd the flock of God, right?
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.780]   To shepherd the flock of God.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.840]   And the way that you see Apostle Peter talking is in line with this concept that he received
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.060]   from Jesus Christ himself when Jesus was resurrected.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.460]   Do you recall?
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.420]   This passage is John chapter 21.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.500]   I'm going to just tell the story starting from like verse 14 and forward.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.900]   Jesus, after his resurrection, goes to seek out Apostle Peter specifically.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.900]   Remember that, right?
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.900]   What was Apostle Peter doing at the time?
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.340]   Perhaps he felt guilty.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.940]   Perhaps he felt ashamed.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.380]   Perhaps he was discouraged.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.960]   So we find in the story that Apostle Peter was going back to fishing.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.240]   And when Jesus appears to him, Jesus asks a sequence of questions that tugs and pulls
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.640]   at the heart of Apostle Peter.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.880]   You guys remember.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   Jesus asks him, "Do you love me?"
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.320]   He asks that question three times and Apostle Peter, in response to that question, says,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.520]   "Lord, do you know I love you?"
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.160]   And every time I read that passage, I wonder if he's, you know, the first time it's like,
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   "Oh yeah, I do."
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.360]   And then the next time, as sequentially, it gets even stronger and stronger, right?
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.880]   Like, "I do, I do."
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.200]   And the last time it's like, "Oh, you know I do."
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.600]   You know?
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.760]   But Jesus' reply to Apostle Peter after the third time was, "Then feed my sheep.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.080]   Then tend to my sheep."
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.760]   So the calling, the exhortation, right?
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.240]   But the task at hand for Apostle Peter that was given directly by Jesus was this command
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.840]   to go shepherd the flock.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.080]   And so in Apostle Peter's perspective, this is not just like, "Man, you know, I've got
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.200]   one ambition."
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.640]   This is like at the core.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.120]   It's his urge, you know?
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.720]   It's his dedication to shepherd the flock of God.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.260]   Please turn your Bibles over to Acts chapter 20.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:31.740]   And there is this profound passage where the Apostle Paul, he spent a lot of time at Ephesus.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.740]   And he was ministering to that church well over two years, okay?
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.540]   And as he's departing, there's this incredibly emotional scene where Apostle Paul and the
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.940]   leaders of Ephesus have this very intimate moment where they're crying over each other.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:54.820]   But look at the words of Apostle Paul in that same similar kind of that urge, the dedication
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.580]   to shepherd the flock of God.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.680]   So I'm going to start reading from verse 18, like right smack in the middle of it.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.620]   So chapter 20, book of Acts, verse 18, okay?
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.120]   It says, "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.460]   From the first day I came into the province of Asia, I served the Lord with great humility,
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.720]   with tears, although I was severely tested by the plot of the Jews.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.900]   You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you, but
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.100]   I've taught you publicly and from house to house.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.980]   I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.860]   faith in our Lord Jesus.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.500]   And now compelled by the Spirit, I'm going to Jerusalem not knowing what will happen
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500]   to me there.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.260]   I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.260]   me.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.140]   However, I consider my life worth nothing to me.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.220]   If only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me, the
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.900]   task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.140]   Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.140]   see me again.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.460]   Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men, for I have
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.900]   not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.740]   Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers."
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.780]   Overseers, right?
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.660]   So all in all, as you hear the words of Apostle Peter, all in all as you hear the words of
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:30.720]   Apostle Paul, and as you look through the scriptures, this kind of heart sentiment,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.700]   we have an incredible amount of responsibility that God has given to us.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.300]   Not just as a, "It would be nice if you could do this please."
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.500]   You know, "Just try and it would be nice if when you have time, when you can find a
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.140]   way it would be nice if you try."
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.180]   I mean, that's not the kind of sentiment you feel, is it?
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.340]   Like there is this burning passion, but there is also this weight of responsibility.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.260]   Apostle Paul is saying, "God, like the Holy Spirit is compelling me and Jesus has given
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.540]   me this task and now my one ambition is to complete it."
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.780]   And I count my life nothing, all the hurdles, whatever I've been through, they're just
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:15.220]   nothing compared to this one passion and desire to complete what God has given me.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.260]   You know?
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:23.340]   So that's what I mean when a good shepherd is going to have a holistic perspective where
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:29.220]   he has an accurate view of what he's doing, the weight of it, the responsibility.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.700]   Okay?
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.660]   Now moving to element number two, element number two.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.980]   A good shepherd values the flock as Christ does.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.260]   Okay?
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:49.260]   It's one thing to be concerned over task, function, production, and goal success.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.300]   Right?
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.180]   It's another thing to value.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:58.140]   Like there's a perspective and heart where it sees precious the flock of God.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:05.900]   Especially to have a kind of affection, to exhibit a kind of sensitivity and like softness,
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.580]   that endearing eye as Christ would.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.180]   And so the way that Apostle Peter even describes, "This is the flock of God, you've been
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.180]   entrusted."
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:22.460]   And remember, you look at the way that Apostle Peter is talking to this group, remember again
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:28.220]   that Apostle Peter knows full well, this is a flock that have been bruised.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.220]   Right?
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.780]   This is a flock that has been hurt.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.180]   This is a flock that needs encouragement.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.100]   These are a people who need strength.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.020]   And so you, if you read the kind of the letter in whole and every passage that we're turning
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.280]   to, he's doing both, giving encouragement, strengthening them, and there is that affection
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.500]   for the flock as he sees it.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   Okay?
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.900]   What's more?
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.260]   If you guys would turn in your Bibles to John chapter 10, we're going to look at some
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:00.820]   of these passages just because, man, there's so many rich biblical texts talking about
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.780]   the attitude, right?
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:08.600]   The attitude behind those who are leaders, behind those who are shepherds, and then here
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.220]   in this passage, we see the beautiful heart of the great chief shepherd.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.260]   Okay?
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.580]   So please go to John chapter 10, starting from verse 7 and following.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.380]   Starting from verse 7 and following.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.540]   It says, "Jesus said to them again, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.860]   sheep.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.380]   All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.380]   I am the door.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:38.660]   If anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.140]   The thieves come only to steal and kill and destroy.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.460]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.540]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.540]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.340]   He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:00.140]   wolves coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.460]   He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.660]   I am the good shepherd, and I know my own and my own know me.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.660]   Even as the father knows me, I know the father, and I lay my life for the sheep.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:23.340]   A good shepherd, according to Jesus, is one who has ownership and care and says, "Those
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.860]   sheep are mine."
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.660]   There is an arrogant way to be like, "This congregation is mine."
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:39.620]   But there is a heart filled, there is a deep love of one who attaches himself to the congregation
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.300]   and says, "This congregation is mine just like that my family is mine, just like my
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.140]   children are mine, just like my wife is mine."
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:55.260]   This kind of bond is actually what really is definitive of a good shepherd.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.100]   There are pastors who sometimes come in.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.620]   There are people who want to work in the church, but what they're hoping to do is just build
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.540]   a good church.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:11.260]   They're good with church models, organizations, which again is not bad, but that alone is
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.300]   not the right perspective.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.640]   What is the right perspective?
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.020]   The right perspective is to make sure that both of these elements are hand in hand, that
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.020]   are absolutely hand in hand.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.100]   You know, there was this time I remember when a close friend of mine one time asked me,
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.440]   "Hey, I'm going to be like out of town for about a week and a half.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.480]   Could you take care of my baby?"
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.600]   Now he wasn't talking about his real baby.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.180]   This was a time when I was really into cars and he was talking about his car baby.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:48.580]   And this was a car that he had souped up, modified, he customized, he spent hours like
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   cleaning this thing, maintaining this thing.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.700]   So he asked me, "I'm going to be gone.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.580]   Could you make sure to drive it around a few times, you know, maybe like once every two
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.780]   days.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.620]   Could you make sure that when you take it out, don't drive it too hard, you know.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.300]   Don't drive it too hard, I know you're tempted and stuff."
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:10.460]   Now to me, as he asked me that, I was just kind of like, "Nah."
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.920]   Why?
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.240]   Because I don't want responsibility.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.620]   The car was nice.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.180]   I knew the car was valuable.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.580]   I knew the car was desirable.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.740]   I knew the car was, you know, like if I rode it, it'd be super cool, all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:28.160]   In many ways, I'm relating that example because we can believe the church is precious.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.020]   Jesus sees the church as the temple of God, His holy presence.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.960]   We can believe the church is the bride of Christ that needs to be purified.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   We can believe the church is pivotal to the redemptive plan of God, and yet, stay at a
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.220]   distance and say, "But I don't want to be responsible.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.100]   I don't want to be responsible when it goes bad, you know.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.780]   I don't want to mess it up."
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:17:00.080]   See, the right heart attitude is to feel both this deep affection, "I love this church,"
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.580]   but then to have this attitude of, "I see the immense responsibility, and I want to
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.580]   make sure I fulfill it."
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.560]   And so a good shepherd doesn't have one or the other, but rather he has both.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.480]   He has both the idea of weight of responsibility, yet at the same time, he has the idea of that
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.800]   attachment and affinity of value of the flock.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.600]   So that's section number one about the elements of a good shepherd.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.920]   Elements of a good shepherd.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.280]   Next, we asked a question, "What is the task?"
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.040]   What is the task of the shepherd?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.960]   He says, "Shepherd the flock."
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   Okay, so what would that be?
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:58.560]   Well, we can use the metaphor, and we can just, you know, like think through the various
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.440]   things that a shepherd must do.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.160]   The passage gives us two clear ones.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.480]   The first is exercise oversight.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.480]   Okay, exercise oversight.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.720]   That word is a present participle, so it should be reading like exercising, you know, regularly
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.560]   exercising oversight, that kind of thing.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.680]   So even oversight is like a big term, is a big term.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.280]   So I ask you this question, you know, in the concept of oversight and shepherding, what
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:38.560]   are some of the priority tasks of a good shepherd?
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.080]   This one, audience participation, please.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:49.760]   You guys can just yell it out.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:57.920]   Say that one more time.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.840]   Perfect, okay, great.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.720]   Making sure that false doctrine is not entering the church, is not spreading, you know.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   So thank you, Isaac, for that.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.520]   Apostle Peter is very concerned about that.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.120]   In the second book of, second Peter, I don't know how to say that.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.720]   In second Peter, the primary subject is making sure that the church is protected from false
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.760]   teachers and false doctrine.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.320]   And Apostle Peter is very strong on that, okay.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   What else?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   That's one.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.840]   You guys can jot that down, make a list, okay.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.040]   Guard against false doctrine.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.800]   What else?
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:43.840]   Teach, feeding the flock and making sure that people are taking in, nourishing, like, you
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.920]   know, soul-filling truth of God, being challenged, being truly fed.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.200]   This is a primary idea of shepherding.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.840]   I mean, actually, if you think about it, what do the shepherds do?
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.440]   They move the sheep along from where to where, pasture to pasture, making sure the sheep
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.320]   are fed, right.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.480]   So a huge element of what shepherds should be doing is feeding.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   What else?
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   Nice, okay.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   Great.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   So he said, "I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to teach the flock to feed the sheep.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   Great."
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.800]   So he said, you know, "Sheep tend to stray and sheep tend to wander."
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.680]   And so there is a corrective, making sure the flock is on track and going the right
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   way.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.680]   Good.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:51.200]   So guiding, guidance, great.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:00.280]   Other stuff.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.600]   So oh yeah, you have another one?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.560]   A student right there.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:15.880]   Go ahead.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.600]   To do everything with a good heart.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   That's good.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:28.000]   Yeah, shepherds shouldn't, you know, beat the flock or use their staff to, yeah, hurt
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   them.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Good.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   So do everything with a good heart.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Okay.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.280]   So I want you guys to think about that because earlier I introduced the topic, this passage
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.200]   is specifically directed at elders, okay?
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.480]   Elders.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.360]   And so, you know, the Greek term is presbytery kind of thing.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.320]   So there's a group of elders, okay?
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:01.040]   But when you delineate the work of ministry and the task at hand, aside from teaching
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.320]   on the pulpit, you do realize there's an element to which we can all buy in to the
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.800]   ministry of shepherding.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.200]   And that's why what's super encouraging to any leader of any church or any organization,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.080]   for all of you who have ever done small group leading, ever done ministry on campus, ever
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.720]   done ministry at church, what's sweet to your heart is people connecting together and
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.040]   growing in the faith, right?
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.000]   Where there is this constant desire to make sure we're protected from false doctrines.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.400]   So you talk to each other about truth.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.800]   Make sure we're doing well so you observe and find out what's going on and you oversee,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   right?
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.300]   To make sure that you guys are learning together biblical doctrine, to make sure if there's
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.840]   anybody hurt, you go minister to them.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:49.040]   And you just realize, yes, the elders are called to shepherd the church at large.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.920]   But the ministry of the church is for every single person.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.000]   And the ministry of the church, we're all going to be essentially, you know, contributing
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.520]   to piece by piece, the ministry together.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.520]   Okay?
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.560]   I just wanted to make that point as we start listing some of these things that we have.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.860]   You know, there are other things I just kind of mentioned.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.760]   You know, in terms of shepherding from a leadership level, we definitely hope to do equipping,
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   right?
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:27.720]   Equipping as a, you know, in terms of allowing the church congregation and flock to be able
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.520]   to do the work of ministry.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.120]   Scripture says in Ephesians chapter 4, and that's why the Holy Spirit gave the church
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.360]   apostles, prophets, teachers, etc.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   Why?
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.960]   So the saints would be equipped.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   They would mature.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.840]   So there is this maturing and building up and being equipped, right?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:49.520]   And of course, there's the idea of healing in a sense of encouraging, uplifting the ones
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.980]   that are downcast, right?
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.980]   So the list can go on.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.360]   I don't want to take too much time with that.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:00.220]   But again, please think on the level of just like, yes, this is directed towards elders.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.080]   But these are all things that you can take initiative to contribute in terms of the work
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.920]   of ministry.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.280]   Okay?
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.680]   Now we move into the question though.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.080]   Okay, so one of the tasks clearly is overseeing.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:23.120]   But the Scripture in this section delineates how that overseeing should be done so that
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.080]   it's in accordance with the will of God and it pleases the Father.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   Okay?
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.080]   So here are some blanks.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.480]   I'm going to just rapid fire give it to you because it's straight from the passage, right?
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:39.280]   One, we should be overseeing, the elders of the church should be overseeing not under
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.720]   compulsion but voluntarily, right?
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.680]   They should be overseeing not for sore gain but with eagerness.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.160]   Okay?
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.840]   Not for sore gain but with eagerness.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:59.000]   They should be overseeing not lording it over them but proving to be examples.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.280]   Okay?
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   So not lording it over them but proving to be examples.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.680]   Okay.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   So, I want to talk about each one.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.200]   Remember, I think I mentioned before that when you see this kind of not this but this,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.720]   you know, Apostle Peter is given an emphatic challenge here in terms of the hard attitude
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.640]   behind how shepherds should oversee.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.400]   Likewise, think about it for you.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.680]   How you serve, how you talk to people.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.800]   At some point or another, there's going to be younger Christians who are looking up to
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.140]   you and how you minister to them.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.440]   This is going to play a huge part into, right?
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.240]   So first, not under compulsion but voluntarily.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.640]   Not under compulsion but voluntarily.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:53.600]   He says that there can be circumstances and situations whether you're serving in just
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.240]   a lay servant, you know, lay member type role or you're serving at a more official leadership
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.000]   role, there can be circumstances where people don't want to be there.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.120]   Where maybe they have in their heart other desires, maybe they're thinking like, "Yeah,
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.320]   I'd rather be doing something else."
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.280]   Maybe they were discouraged.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:18.700]   Whatever it may be, they don't have the internal desire but rather the external stuff is propping
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.700]   them up.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.680]   You know, this can happen.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.400]   I know times when people because of like bad run-ins.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.840]   This happens sometimes where you have a bad run-in with one individual and that completely
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.200]   like deflates you, you know, and you just kind of feel like, "I don't want to be serving
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.800]   in this team anymore."
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.840]   Sometimes it's because your own personal motivation is just lost, you know.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.160]   And then once you get to, you're looking for just approval, you're looking just to not
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.820]   be ashamed, like whatever it may be, that's happening, okay?
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.120]   So on that level, I just wanted to kind of describe what that kind of scenario could
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.600]   look like.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:05.280]   For me as I was thinking, you know, just truthfully, "Huh, what are the times when, I don't know,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.500]   like I don't want to be doing the work kind of thing?"
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.200]   And I was just sitting there and trying to examine my heart, you know, asking the question.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.900]   And then there wasn't anything like, "Oh, epiphany," you know.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.800]   It's all the same stuff we struggle with.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:27.960]   I noticed that when I just flat out get lazy, then everything, everything that I do is because
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.800]   of compulsion.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.780]   Like everything that I do feels forced.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.300]   And even the way I talk, like someone asks me like, "Hey, how's your day go?"
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.000]   And then the next words out of my mouth is what?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.900]   "Well, I got to," you know.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.080]   And I hear people talk about that too.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.200]   And even the regular mundane things where you're normally naturally expected to do,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.400]   you start talking about it like, "Well, I got to do this," you know.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.520]   "Well, I got to get up and I got to get in my car and I got to drive to work," as if
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.600]   like everybody in the world does that, you know.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:09.340]   But now everything feels like compulsion if there's laziness in your heart, you know.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.280]   And I realized that's a susceptibility for every single person.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.160]   And when your heart is in that condition, whether it's the church asking you to do this,
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.600]   whether it's your wife asking you, husband asking you, children asking you, people you
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.920]   love asking you, your mom asking you, what does it feel like?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.420]   It feels like extra burden, right?
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.940]   It feels like something extra has been placed on you.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.120]   And so I want to give a challenge here.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.760]   I mean, that's the, let's not be like that, you know.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   Describing that fallen sinfulness for us, that's so easy for even anybody, whether it's
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.600]   you're high on leadership or you're not on leadership, whatever it may be, you can feel
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.920]   like everything you're doing is, "I got to," right?
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.000]   But he says, "Rather do it voluntarily.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.600]   Rather do it with a free will of, 'I want to do this,' rather than begrudgingly do it
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.360]   gladly," right?
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.960]   That God, knowing that God delights in a cheerful giver, not because of compulsion, not because
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.200]   someone twisted your arm, someone looked at you and said, "Come on, pay up," though rather
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   from your own volition, you decided, "This is what I'd like to give to God," right?
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.180]   "This is how I'd like to serve you."
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.400]   And that's what he's talking about with this voluntary action.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:35.200]   So we can have sometimes discouragement or whatever, but we have to do things voluntarily.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.000]   Can I speak to you guys a little bit on a thinking about leadership thing?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.040]   I remember asking Pastor Peter one time, you know, Pastor Peter, I respect him so much
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.840]   because he see things very clearly.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.400]   That's how I view him, you know?
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.640]   He's very discerning.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.000]   And all the fluff and all the different things in life, he's able to like kind of cut through
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.080]   and say, "Hey, this is the core issue."
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:04.840]   And so one time I remember asking him, "When you look at perspective, let's say pastors,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.280]   you know, young men who want to be in leadership, what are the key things you look for?"
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.280]   You know?
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   I remember asking him that.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.960]   And I remember him saying, "Well, there is this, there's a typical things that you know,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.600]   like he's got to be holy, he's got to be X, Y, and Z, you know, committed to the church,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.560]   be a good member, all that kind of stuff."
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.400]   But then he says, "There's this intangible, there is this it."
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   And I was like, "What is it?"
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   You know?
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   "There is this it part of it."
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:37.080]   And he says, "There is this drive in a young man who's going to be a successful pastor
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   because he's waiting for no one because there is this desire in his heart where he voluntarily
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:47.800]   wants to worship, pray, evangelize, proclaim, serve, and love on people.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.120]   He's not waiting for someone to give him an opportunity, so he never complains about lack
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.480]   of opportunity.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   He's not waiting for someone to provide an atmosphere.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.940]   He's never talking about lack of space, time, and opportunity.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.080]   He just does it because he wants to.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.000]   But then when young men start to complain, "Oh, church hasn't given me, you know, a
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.440]   lens, church hasn't given me a platform, church hasn't given me teaching opportunity," then
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.840]   you realize there is a revelation of a desire in his heart perhaps for something else than
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:20.280]   the purity of voluntarily doing what God has designed.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.760]   I remember thinking, "Wow, that's true."
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.840]   When a young man can get so easily discouraged because he never got a pulpit opportunity,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.800]   I mean, is that what he was looking for then?
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.760]   A nice wood-stained pulpit?
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.800]   You know?
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.600]   And that was a really big challenge to my own heart.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   Yeah, like in terms of doing work of ministry, serving the Lord, what am I waiting for?
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:48.080]   I mean, I have to really ask that question, "What is stopping me?"
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.880]   And if I really think about it, it's just my perspective, right?
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.200]   It's my faith.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.600]   And so anyway, we're thinking about this challenge to the elders and saying, "Don't do it by
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   compulsion.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.460]   Don't do it with begrudging, like forced duty.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.160]   It is a duty, but nonetheless, do it with voluntary."
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.560]   And you know that God is desiring for us in His will to serve Him wholeheartedly in that
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.040]   way.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:20.560]   Next, the next hard attitude that Apostle Peter says to the elders, and he says this,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:28.160]   "When you're overseeing the flock, do it not for sword gain, but with eagerness, but with
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.080]   eagerness."
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.320]   Here's an interesting idea about sword gain, okay?
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.240]   In life, we could have a conflict of interest, right?
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.480]   We can be in a situation where we have a conflict of interest, and when there is a greediness
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   in the heart, when there was a longing, not just for money.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.240]   I mean, we know the people who long for money.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.400]   You know, I remember very distinctly, I was watching these interviews with one of those
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.200]   prosperity gospel people, and that kind of stuff, I mean, it's just so blatant, right?
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   There is a guy named T.D.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   Jakes.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.160]   He's so blatant, it's not even, you know, some of the other prosperity gospel guys, they'll
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.200]   kind of like weasel and say, "Oh, you know, like God is blessing us, and we're still pursuing
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   God."
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   T.D.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.640]   Jakes, I'm just, I'm flat out naming him because I've never met a guy who's so blunt.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:26.540]   He's getting interviewed by NBC, and he said, "God is the best product out there to sell."
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.120]   And he just flat out said, "Jesus sells, and when you've got a good product, you don't
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.760]   even have to be that good of a salesman."
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.480]   I mean, he just would say stuff like that, and you're just cringing, like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.420]   what's wrong with you?"
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.840]   How can, like, he had this event over two weekends, and supposedly 500,000 people went
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.680]   through his event.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.080]   Regularly on a Sunday, there's 30,000 people who meet at his church, and you're just thinking,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   "Mind-boggling," right?
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.320]   "Mind-boggling."
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.680]   But at the same time, you take a moment, you look into your heart, and again, this was
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.960]   a tough passage for me, because every time I kind of look back, and I say, "Okay, perhaps
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.200]   maybe, maybe, I'm not as blatantly greedy for money."
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.560]   But we can get greedy, you know?
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.440]   I mean, who doesn't want to work and reap the benefits of it?
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.520]   Who doesn't want to receive credit for what he's done?
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.440]   Who doesn't want to at least receive whatever it may be?
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.320]   It doesn't have to be physical, tangible, monetary good, but he can receive other stuff.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.240]   Who doesn't want more?
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.440]   Want more of control, want more of X, Y, and Z, want more of this, want more of that, and
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.600]   there can be a greediness in our heart, even when we are serving God.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.280]   And we have to watch out for that.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.480]   But instead, but instead, oh, I forgot this story.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.760]   So Peter, he has words for people who have greediness in their heart, okay?
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.040]   There's a story in Acts chapter 8, verse 18.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   This was kind of a real like, "Whoa!" moment in the book of Acts, because apostle Peter
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.920]   is going and preaching, and there's a lot of miracles being done and people being saved,
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   okay?
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.480]   So you can turn your Bibles to Acts chapter 8.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.900]   I'm going to read a section of it, starting from verse 18, okay?
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.240]   But just giving you the backdrop of the story, Philip goes and preaches in Samaria, and
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.960]   people are being converted.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:26.200]   But at that time, the miraculous gift of the Holy Spirit visibly was seen when an apostle
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.880]   would come so that they could see that the authority of the apostles is giving this blessing
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.960]   of the Holy Spirit, okay?
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   So apostle Philip is preaching, people are being converted, and there's this guy named
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.080]   Simon who used to be a sorcerer, a magician.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.360]   So it was his trade to kind of wow people.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.400]   It was his trade to get money from the work of something spiritual, you know?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.960]   Well, this guy Simon gets converted, and then apostle Peter comes, and that guy is like
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.480]   big-eyed now, he's like, "Whoa!
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.960]   What did that apostle just do?"
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.920]   Apostle Peter just laid hands, and he was blessing people, and there was this miraculous
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.960]   like coming down of the Spirit, and people were really being transformed, okay?
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.160]   And so this is where it comes down to.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.040]   He says, "Now, when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.960]   apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, 'Give me this authority to me as well, so
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.760]   that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.840]   And then look at this, Peter has some words for him.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.960]   "Peter said to him, 'May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could attain
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.840]   the gift of God with money.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.640]   You have no part, no portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.200]   Therefore repent on this wickedness of yours, and pray, O Lord, that if possible the intention
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.220]   of your heart may be forgiven you.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.920]   For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in bondage of iniquity.'"
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.300]   Dang, right?
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.360]   Apostle Peter has some really strong, harsh words.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:06.000]   I mean, on the outside appearance, that guy Simon appeared to convert.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.040]   He claimed the name of Christ.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.480]   On an outside experience, he wanted to do maybe some work, you know?
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.600]   But as soon as he said, "Ooh," he had this greed in his heart and said, "Can I do that
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   too?
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   Here's some money.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   Teach me how to do it."
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.160]   Apostle Peter said, "Your heart is wrong.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.880]   You need to get right with God.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.760]   You have no part in this portion, and you need to repent."
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.560]   Very strong words from a man with greediness in his heart.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.640]   And so Apostle Peter encourages them that you need to have an eagerness.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.760]   You need to have this desire.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:43.840]   The opposite of this greedy selfishness is to have a pure, loving intention for others
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.520]   where you are desiring for their best.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.880]   An eagerness to offer, eagerness to sacrifice, eagerness to do good to all of those who are
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.600]   near and amidst.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.080]   And that's what Apostle Peter is challenging us to have.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.920]   For the sake of time, I'm going to read to you another passage.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   Just listen.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.240]   He says, "And now I commend you to God and the word of His grace, which is able to build
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.680]   you up and give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.640]   I coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:18.880]   You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to men who were with me.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.040]   In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner, you must help the weak
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.240]   and remember the words of the Lord Jesus that He Himself said, 'It is better, or sorry,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.680]   it is more blessed to give than to receive.'
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.000]   And when He said these things, He knelt down, prayed with all of them.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.800]   He began to weep out loud and embrace Paul and repeatedly kissed them."
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.960]   So he says to them, look at the example that I gave to you, Apostle Paul speaking again
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   to the Ephesians.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.840]   That's from Acts chapter 20 again.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.680]   Acts 20 verse 33 and on.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.200]   He said, "Remember, my heart and intention was pure with you.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.680]   When I had a need, I didn't burden you."
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.400]   He says that to the Corinthians as well.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.600]   I worked hard day and night not to be a burden to you.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   Why?
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.080]   Because I show you I'm loving you voluntarily with eagerness to give to you because I believe
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.680]   it's better.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   My God told me it's more blessed.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.120]   It's the more blessed way to give rather than receive.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.440]   So rather than, you know, these wicked modern day prosperity gospel teachers looking at
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.840]   the congregation like, "Good.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.680]   Business is good.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.160]   Big old fat membership giving tithe every week.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.000]   Solid."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.240]   Looking at the sheep like something to be squeezed so they can have, you know, things
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   to sell.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.880]   Rather, they're looking at the flock with heart and intention to love and to give and
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.920]   to minister to them.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.280]   So that's not for sword gain but with eagerness in their heart.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:51.560]   And lastly, Apostle Peter says, "The way that we ought to shepherd is not lording over those
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.960]   allotted to their care but proving to be examples."
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:02.520]   Not lording over those allotted to their care but proving to be examples.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.600]   You know, from when we're young, we're asked that question.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.320]   "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   You know?
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   And you can just imagine all the kids saying like, "Oh, I want to be..." and then they
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.000]   all like name the stuff they want to be.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.720]   Doctor, you know, X, Y, and Z.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.520]   And then there are those kids who are super blunt.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.000]   "I want to be the boss."
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   You know?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.480]   "Why do you want to be the boss?"
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.040]   "Because I just want to boss people around."
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.560]   "I want to tell people what to do."
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.600]   It just starts super early.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.880]   It starts super early.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:38.880]   This desire to not be under but over.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.280]   This desire to dominate people.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.520]   Feeling like to lead is actually better than to follow.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.560]   Right?
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.120]   Our worldly convention, our worldly perspective and principle is just that.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.400]   It's more blessed to lead and have dominance over people.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.240]   But remember it was Jesus Christ who flipped that all completely upside down.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.560]   Matthew chapter 20, verse 25 through 28.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   Okay?
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.920]   Jesus said, "Jesus called them to himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:14.360]   Gentiles lorded over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.640]   It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.800]   your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.320]   Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve to give his life a ransom
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.160]   for many.'"
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:39.400]   So the concept here is just this idea like, in number one, there is an arrogance and pride
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.760]   that can tempt any leader, any servant.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   You know?
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.620]   I mean, there are times and moments where maybe that kind of pride was tested.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:54.120]   Have you ever, you know, have you ever maybe had a small group experience or maybe you
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.000]   were a small group leader and the guys in your small group disrespected you?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.520]   Have you ever had a time when you're at work and you have a certain title but someone just
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520]   put like, "Hey, Bob."
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.520]   You know?
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.200]   Just completely dismiss your title, completely dismiss your position, whatever it may be.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.400]   I mean, we know every single one of us wrestles with pride to a certain degree.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   Right?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.860]   Well, Apostle Peter is challenging us here.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.420]   We have a desire to have control.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:28.260]   We have a desire to sometimes bully people into doing what we want, where our agenda
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:35.220]   and desire for like, how this thing should be, you know, becomes so strong that if someone
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.020]   else says, "I don't want to do it."
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.220]   It's like, "What'd you say?
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.220]   Do you know who I am?"
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.620]   Da-da-da-da-da, you know?
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.620]   Whatever it may be.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:49.580]   I want to give this challenge here that Apostle Peter is saying, of the many pitfalls of being
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.660]   a leader, one, we go back and just review real quick.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.740]   One, we can do things out of duty and compulsion.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.260]   Two, we can do things selfishly out of gain.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.380]   Three, we can do things out of arrogance and pride.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:12.300]   Can I remind us, for us as Christians, when we do the work of God, it's not just what
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.380]   we do that matters.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.640]   It's not even just how we do that matters.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.180]   For us as Christians, why we do what we do matters immensely.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:28.500]   All three, what we do, how we do it, and why we do it, what motivation for what cause,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:34.460]   what end, and if at that end, it's for my dominance, my position, and my glory, then
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.980]   even if we're the greatest thing on earth, God would look at us and say, "And you thought
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.660]   that was impressive?
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.660]   Racks."
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.660]   Right?
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.620]   "And you thought you did it for me?
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.940]   You hardly know me."
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:56.340]   For us as Christians, all of that, in terms of the motivation of the heart, matters intensely,
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:04.780]   where our motivation can stain and completely negate all the good works that we've done.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:09.380]   And you've experienced it probably before, where an individual who had maybe offered
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.740]   you to take you out, an individual who had offered you to do certain things, an individual
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.220]   who maybe gave you gifts, an individual who showed you a good time, and all that kind
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.260]   of stuff, and then it turns around, and then they start expecting things from you.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.140]   They start trying to bully you and correct you, and now all of a sudden, everything they've
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.300]   done is kind of like, "Whoa."
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.340]   Then what was all that for?
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.340]   Right?
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.780]   Likewise, Apostle Peter challenges those who would take the responsibility in church and
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.940]   encourages them.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:45.660]   "You shall not exercise your oversight, lording over people, exercising your arrogance more
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.900]   than the love of Christ."
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.980]   And so rather, he says, in contrast to that lording over and dominance over people, he
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.620]   says, "You need to be a good example.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.660]   You need to have a pattern of godliness that people will desire to follow.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:07.540]   There is a difference between a man who's skilled and can perform versus a man who is
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:15.460]   a model Christian, godly at heart, and every aspect of his life is exemplary as they follow
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:16.460]   Christ."
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.460]   That's a huge challenge.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:23.100]   That's a huge, huge challenge.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.620]   And so, as we think about this, Apostle Peter, when he makes that huge challenge, he's the
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.980]   one who both encourages and he himself follows that example.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.320]   What do I mean by that?
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:41.220]   Going back to verse 1, we see when Apostle Peter says, "Therefore, I exert you, the elders
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.880]   among you," right?
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   And what does he say?
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:50.240]   "As your fellow elders and as basically your fellow witnesses of the sufferings of Christ
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.880]   and the partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed."
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   So what does he say?
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.840]   Essentially, remember I said he understands.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.320]   We have a common witness.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.080]   We have a common hope for the glory that's to come, and I'm with you in this experience.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.400]   So he essentially practices what he preaches.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.600]   He is humble at heart.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600]   He is with them.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   He wants to serve them.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.760]   He wants to be a humble participant in the work of God rather than over them.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.300]   We easily could have said, "I'm an apostle.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.360]   You guys are the ones I say, I convert it.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.360]   Do it.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   Do what I say."
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:31.280]   But rather, he puts himself, identifies in that position, and when he does that, you
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.500]   realize not only is he saying, "I have the same witness and the same hope as you," he's
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.960]   also saying, "Then I'm going through the same danger.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.000]   I'm going through the same risk.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.200]   I'm going through the same pain, and I'm going through the same hurt," right?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:53.400]   He is willing, more than willing, to walk with them in this rather than lording it over
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   them.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   There is a difference.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:00.160]   There is a difference when a man is willing only to command versus a man who is willing
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.280]   to walk with those he's leading.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.160]   It's two entirely different things.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.920]   And that's why the idea of a shepherd, the metaphor of a shepherd, is good.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:19.360]   God did not call us in ministry, in encouraging people, in really trying to edify the people
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.920]   around you to be policemen.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.440]   He didn't call us to be drivers in the back, like, "Here's the whip.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   Use it, okay?"
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.200]   Like, that's not what He said to us.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:36.000]   We're trying to be shepherds, disciples, partakers, fellowship, brothers and sisters.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.640]   And that's the idea, the contrast you see there between those who would lord it over
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:46.760]   versus those who would prove to be an example walking with the flock.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.920]   I want to say, now that we've kind of covered some really important parts here, right?
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:56.960]   We talked about two essential elements of a good shepherd, that he sees the weight of
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.080]   responsibility, he sees the value of the flock, and he's going to have these characteristic
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:09.040]   heart issues where he's not, you know, "I can't do it," you know, "these dirty sheep."
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.960]   No, he's desiring voluntarily.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.460]   He's not in it for sword gain, but he is eager to give sacrifice and he believes it's better
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.440]   to give than to receive.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:23.500]   And he's not lording it over with arrogance, but he's walking with them, right?
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.720]   But all in all, in terms of a characteristic of a good shepherd, in the end it comes down
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:36.200]   to having such a care that would resemble the care of Christ.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.800]   Having such a love that it would resemble the love of Christ.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:48.420]   Having such an affection that just as Christ would be moved when he looks upon the people,
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:53.380]   and whenever he sees a flock without a shepherd, whenever he sees people who are lost, he's
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:49:02.980]   broken in his heart, that, that heart attitude, those eyes, that care defines a good shepherd.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:10.500]   Remember, I remember for me, what brought me into ministry was the Bible.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.960]   I told Pastor Peter, I said, "The Bible is the bomb.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.460]   It's so good.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.740]   I want to teach it."
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:22.180]   And I remember the elders sat me down and they were trying to teach me leadership in
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.660]   the church.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.660]   You might think it's like, "Yeah, you're going to study in your office and then you're going
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.940]   to like research and you're going to write and you're going to," yeah, there are pastors
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.940]   who do that.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:39.060]   But in terms of the calling of God that he's given us is to love his flock, to love his
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.260]   people.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.300]   And that's what we need to aspire to.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.660]   That's what we need to desire.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.060]   Now I'm just kind of confessing to you early on when I first heard that, I was kind of
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.700]   like, "I don't know.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.900]   I'm not that good with people.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.980]   I just want to teach."
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:03.420]   But over the years I realized, I mean, the bulk of all ministry is to make sure that
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:08.700]   you are being attentive to the needs of God's flock, to make sure you care enough to know
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:15.420]   where are people hurting, to understand who they are, to understand what they need.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:22.340]   And I want to give an exhortation to you again, that does not require the title pastor.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:27.580]   That requires you just simply to put yourself in the shoes of Christ and to look with his
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:32.740]   eyes and to feel with his heart, to look at people with compassion, to look at people
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:38.420]   with earnest desire to do them good, to humble yourself and say, "I consider your needs
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.060]   more important than mine."
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:45.180]   And that's what Apostle Peter is saying that the leader should do, but that's also what
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:51.020]   the Apostle Peter is saying, "These are the kind of examples you as a church need to follow."
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:55.140]   So I want to conclude with a final thought.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:01.580]   As we think about that, I'm now relaying to you that the exhortation Apostle Peter gave
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:05.020]   to the elders and said, "You need to shepherd the church."
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:12.820]   There's a responsibility obviously, yes, weighty, incredibly, you know, serious delegated stewardship
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:17.580]   for the elders, but it's also the responsibility of the whole church.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   And now we have as a concluding thought, we all have to account and meet the chief shepherd.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:32.700]   We all at one point have to meet the chief shepherd and be held accountable for that.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.500]   Earlier I was talking a lot about responsibility.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.260]   I use that word intentionally a lot, right?
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.980]   The elders have a responsibility.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.260]   We have a responsibility.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.700]   We have this calling.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:47.220]   Well where there is responsibility, there is going to be somebody who then holds you
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:52.140]   responsible, right?
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:58.580]   Where there is responsibility, then there is going to be someone who holds you responsible.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:03.260]   And we, we have to meet the chief shepherd.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.940]   That thought sobers me so deep.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.460]   And as I think about that, how am I going to prepare for this?
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.980]   How am I going to, you know, answer to Christ and all that kind of stuff?
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.940]   Then I recall in 1 Corinthians chapter 4, you can turn there, it's an important passage
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   please.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:23.420]   1 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 1 through 6.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:29.740]   That in light of the sobering truth, what we do in ministry, the labor of love, that
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:35.500]   we're really doing this on the call, on the account of what our chief shepherd has
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.140]   designed, then to him we're going to give an answer.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:46.500]   But the way Apostle Paul sees it, he says this, "Let a man regard us in this manner
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.060]   as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:57.060]   In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:01.460]   But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you or any human court.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:06.460]   In fact, I do not even examine myself, for I am conscious of nothing against myself.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:12.860]   Yet I am not by this acquitted, but the one who examines me is the Lord.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.700]   For do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes, who will
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:21.020]   both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.180]   hearts.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:26.440]   And then each man's praise will come to him from God."
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:33.980]   So as we look at that, the key concept I want to leave you with is, in terms of your desires
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.100]   to be engaged in the life of the church and the ministry of the church, and for me in
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:43.340]   terms of my own heart's desire of thinking through, like, man, I really want to be faithful
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:49.260]   to the opportunity, the privilege, right, to be able to work for Him.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.820]   The privilege to be able to serve Him in this fashion.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:59.960]   The main thing I want to say is, just like Apostle Paul, I want to be found trustworthy.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:05.500]   If God has so thought it wise to place the flock in the hands of those who would be His
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:13.180]   under shepherds, then my great ambition is that I will be proven to be trustworthy.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:18.180]   That God would look, that the church would look and say, "This is an individual who is
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:23.660]   trustworthy because they're handling the precious flock of God with the same kind of care and
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.660]   love."
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.660]   Amen?
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:30.740]   All right, let's take some time to pray.
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:39.020]   Father Lord, we realize, God, that, you know, over the course of studying 1 Peter, you've
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.700]   given us such a great purpose.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:46.020]   You've called us to be your holy temple.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:50.140]   You've called us to be a great nation and possession for you.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.420]   You've called us to proclaim your excellencies.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.420]   What's more, you've called us to be involved in the work of your ministry, making sure
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.020]   that the flock is doing well.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:06.620]   I ask, Lord, that, you know, God, we just repent of the fact that we live in a generation
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.900]   that's truly so selfish and we look out for our own ends.
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:15.020]   But I ask, Lord, that you would give us the humility of Christ and, Lord, that you would
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:20.340]   give us, grant to us the love and heart of Christ, that we would look out and love each
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.180]   other truly with sincerity and from the heart.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:29.220]   And I ask, Lord, that as we do that, God, your work would be done and you would be glorified.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.200]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
