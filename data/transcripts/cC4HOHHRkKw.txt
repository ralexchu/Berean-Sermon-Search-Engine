[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   >> Heavenly Father, we come singing this song to you.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   Father, recognizing that so often we don't see you in such a light.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   But God, we come to you tonight with a desire as a church to pray,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   entering into your presence, remembering who you are.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   And so, Father, tonight I pray for a fruitful time.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   Not fruitful just based upon how we might feel or whatever just natural sight that we might have.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   But Lord, spiritually, that we'd be engaged.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   And God, that we would have an opportunity tonight to lay all these things down before you.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   So thank you, Lord, for the privilege to pray together.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   Okay, well, welcome to All Church Praise and Prayer.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   It's dark. I cannot see a single face right now.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   But we are here gathered every once a month to do this, to pray.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   And I hope that it is a sweet time for all of us.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   And tonight we're going to be giving you as much just unhindered time as possible for you to be praying on your own.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   And so we're going to be starting off with just a call into this passage, 1 Peter 4, verse 7,
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.440]   which we'll post up for you here where it says, "The end of all things is near.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   And one more time, just to look at those words, I've broken it down a little bit.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   But it says, "Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit."
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   And then it concludes by saying, "For the purpose of prayer."
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   And as we've been having that similar theme for the last couple years,
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.440]   just recognizing what it is that sometimes we might sit here and pray for soberness.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.440]   We've talked about this now a few times.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   But to recognize that here in this passage it's saying that you don't pray for soberness,
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   you need soberness in order to pray properly.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   It's something that we need in order to engage with the Lord.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   And so our effectiveness in prayer is going to be very much based upon our level of soberness.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   Now, sometimes these things become very circular.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.440]   It's not something that we're going to have down all the time.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   It's not going to be--we're in a prayerful attitude and a mood all the time.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   And yet, entering into soberness is something that we can actually do.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   And so tonight, instead of tonight having a bunch of just constant prayer requests going out on the screen,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.440]   what we're going to have for you are four pitfalls to prayer.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   And the reason why I'm going to be putting up four pitfalls to prayer
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   is actually to accomplish the very opposite of that.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   So seeing that there are pitfalls in prayer, dangers when it comes to our prayers,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   let's try to be aware of that and then engage in exactly the opposite manner.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   It's usually the way the enemy works is he desires to use whatever advantage that he has
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   to kind of manipulate and to provoke and cause us to go down these certain paths.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   If we're aware of some of these pitfalls, then we can be soberly engaging against it.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   So to give a little bit of instruction first before I go into how this is going to look
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   means that there's going to be a long, a more extended, maybe about 10, sometimes 15 minutes of prayer
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.440]   that's going to be just lengthy where there is going to be no real guidance from me up here
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.440]   other than the periodic times I'll take us into some of the prayer requests.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   So during those longer stretches, it is a muscle that you're going to have to build up again tonight.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   That means you will have to fight for soberness tonight because after some time in prayer,
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   it might become difficult to continue in prayer, but to wrestle through that.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   Now what the Praise Team is here to do is to help us to be able to actually sing
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   and to worship and to pray and to kind of go in and out.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.440]   So without much prompting, sometimes they're going to start singing
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   and that's not going to be a cue for you to just stop praying.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   You can continue to pray through those times, or you can join in and sing some more as well
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   and then go back into prayer.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.440]   So that's what it's going to look like tonight.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.440]   So there's going to be five prayer topics we're going through, four pitfalls, and then a final prayer.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   So the first two pitfalls, the first one is going to be praying without thought.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   That's the first pitfall, when we pray without really engaging our minds.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Now that's why if you are aware, sometimes you become very self-aware of prayer
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   when you feel like you're kind of saying things without thinking,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   when phrases that are coming up out of your mouth, out of your heart, seem to be repetitious
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   or they don't have a ton of content to it, or it just seems like something that you habitually
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   have been accustomed now to say these things.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   A lot of maybe Christian phrases, a lot of filler words,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   and this first pitfall to combat it is to say, "Let's try to pray with thought."
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   Let's pray with thought.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   Let me read for us Matthew 6, verse 7.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   "And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do,
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   for we suppose that they will be heard for their many words.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him."
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   And so Jesus actually tells this to His disciples, "Don't use meaningless repetition."
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   This is an opportunity for us every time we're in prayer to engage with the Lord.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   It's not like the action of prayer in and of itself is anything other than the fact of what it's accomplishing.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.440]   If we just say mindless words, then God would not be pleased with that,
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   and that would not be helpful to us.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   And so to pray with thought is to also fill our minds then with content.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   Instead of just saying like, "Thank you for food, thank you for my home,
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   thank you for all the things that you've given me, my job, I pray for this person,"
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   tonight really to engage in some of the text that I put up here.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   I know that the font is a little small, so if you can't see it and you're in the back,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   you might want to kind of try to move up somewhere down the nighttime.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   But I put up a few passages here, and some of you know what it is to pray through Scripture,
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   but that's what I'm going to be asking you to do tonight.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   So to take time in the middle of prayer to look up, read the text,
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   and to pray some of the desires that God has for us and pray it right back to Him.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   So for example, in Ephesians 1, verse 18, when it says,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened,"
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   that's something that you can pray to God.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   "God, would you enlighten the eyes of my heart?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.440]   Would you help me to see where I can't see?
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   Would you help me in the places where I have grown blind
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.440]   or I have turned purposely a blind eye towards?"
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.440]   And so to launch off of Scripture and to pray a little bit more content,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.440]   a little bit more what it is that God would desire for us
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   because we want to do His will, and He has given us His will.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   And so that ought to be many times how we pray.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   So I just gave two short passages up there that have to deal with just engaging the mind,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   the thought, filling ourselves with understanding,
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   and ultimately tonight in this first one to look to God in Scripture
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   because if we want to fill our minds with the things of God,
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   what else can we actually engage in other than Scripture?
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   Everything ought to kind of flow up out of there as a basis.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   And so you don't need to sit there and just pray every line of the Scriptures,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   but let it help become like the propelling agent tonight,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   that the Scriptures would be what you're praying,
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   and it would be the rooting factor in your prayer.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   So that's the first pitfall.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   The second one is praying without presence, without God's presence.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   And so then to combat that, to engage in prayer tonight,
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   I'm going to be asking you to pray in His presence.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.440]   Now this is such a fascinating thing because we're very much aware that God is an omnipresent God.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   He is here with us in this room.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   He has never been away.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   And yet to recognize what it is that He is near is very important when we pray.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   Even though the first pitfall I mentioned was about just mindlessly or thoughtlessly praying,
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   praying is not just thinking either.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.440]   It's not sitting down and closing our eyes and having godly thoughts.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   It's recognizing who He is and then praying to Him as if we are talking to someone.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   Now like prayer has become so much so habitual to us where we can pray minutes of prayer,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   just extended times of prayer without ever really engaging the Lord in His presence.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   So in soberness to see, "God, you're here and I'm talking to you," that would be the second pitfall.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   So the passage I have for you up there is in Psalm 63 that shows us what it would be like
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   to be someone like David who sees the absolute hunger and thirst that he has inside,
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   the craving he has for God and His very presence.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   And so to pray those things right back to God, to pray these words, this Psalm,
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   and say, "God, this is what I desire tonight," to pray in your presence.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   Remember how much God desires a relationship with you.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   Remember how much He's probably been trying to catch your attention today.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   How there has been grace after grace after grace that He's been extending towards you.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   Remember that He wants to engage with you, that He wants to love you and He wants you to love Him.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:21.440]   Remember that God in His joy and delight, He wants to hear from us.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   He wants us to open ourselves to His presence.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   He wants us to kind of look up at Him, to square our shoulders.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   For you parents, if you've ever had a kid come home after some event and you want to talk to them,
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.440]   but they don't want to talk to you, you know what it's like.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   They're not engaging, they're giving one-word answers, they're on their phones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   But what I mean by praying in His presence is to square your shoulders,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   to lock eyes on God, and to speak to Him,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   and to pray in a manner that is not just worthy of the gospel,
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.440]   but in a manner that He so desires of us tonight.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.440]   So those are going to be the first two prayer requests that we're going to be kind of going through.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.440]   I have on the right side there some bullet points if you need a little bit of help,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   but I've kept it very open-ended.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   So it is going to be on you tonight to engage.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   So we're going to now have an extended time of prayer.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   And after that extended time, I'll be coming up to give the next two.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   Let me just pray for us to enter into this time.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.440]   Heavenly Father, according to Your Word, the enemy is very near.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   Father, he desires to take down the believer.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   And Father, he will use whatever is at his disposal to manipulate, to topple over, to devour.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   So God, I pray for a hundred sober hearts in this room tonight.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   Father, I pray for every single one of us to engage, that our minds would be engaged,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   that we'd be ready to wrestle.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   And Father, that we would take a moment to say, "This is worth entering into the presence of our God."
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   Father, would You let this then be a time that is both pleasing to You and so good for us.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.440]   [music]
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   Our holy, holy God.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.440]   You are the majestic one in power.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   You are, Father, ferocious in your might.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   And God, there is not one like you.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   And Father, we recognize you tonight.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.440]   We give you glory.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.440]   We give you honor and praise.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   Father, in all that you are,
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   I want to thank you because
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:05.440]   with the power that you come in, you love us so much.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.440]   And God, you desire to draw near to us as we prayed and sang before.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   Father, that is a staggering truth.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   And I ask you then tonight,
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   Father, please don't leave us alone.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   God, there is too much sin in this room.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.440]   Father, there is too much of us
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.440]   when this room needs to be filled with you.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.440]   Father, bring discipline because we need you.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:46.440]   Father, continue to care for us in the way only you can.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:53.440]   We pray for a church that's filled with people that doesn't just talk.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.440]   But God, that we surrender.
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.440]   That we empty ourselves so that you would be seen and that you would be magnified.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   Father, clear away the blindness.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   Clear away, God, the darkness.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.440]   With your steadfast light,
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.440]   Father, cause us again to see you.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.440]   Our last prayer request is going to be just on evangelism.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   And this is a very simple one, and so I didn't add anything to it.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.440]   But everyone that you can think of,
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   everyone that comes to your mind,
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   even the people you've forgotten,
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   the people you've given up on,
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   would you bring all of them into prayer tonight?
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.440]   We are not going to be concluding service by breaking off into groups.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   So just use the rest of this time here to pray for everyone you can.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   Remember the truths of scripture.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   Remember that tomorrow is not promised to them.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Pray in urgency.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   Pray remembering all of the might and the fear that we would have of God.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.440]   But also all of the love and the grace that we have in Christ.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   That that is all what we would want for them.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   And to pray with hearts filled with real desire.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   Again, let's remember why we are here.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   Let's take moments to remember the Great Commission.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   When he says that we are called now to go and make disciples of all nations.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   Baptizing, teaching, observing, all of these things.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   That our goal here is actually very simple.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.440]   That our careers, that all our desires,
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   a lot of it ought to be shaped by what Christ has called for us to do while we're here.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.440]   Because everything else, our home awaits us.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.440]   So let's take this time.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.440]   And at the end I'll come up and we'll sing a final song and close in prayer for the night.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   So please take this time.

[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   Let's all stand.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:40.440]   We realize that as we prayed for those who do not know Christ, we know it's only by Christ's power, the Holy Spirit's conviction.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   So as we sing this last song, we're going to reflect that it's through Christ alone.

[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   Let's close in prayer.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.440]   Father, I pray that we leave with united hearts.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   God, regardless of all the stuff.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:04.440]   God, that we would leave with the same desire, the same spirit unifying us, the same goals.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.440]   Father, the same destination.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   And God, that there would be something in this church that would be led by prayer, that would be led by your spirit.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:24.440]   And Father, that all these things that we left up to you, God, that we would continue.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:32.440]   Father, we pray because we very well know how difficult it is for us to pray.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.440]   Lord, would you teach us to pray.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.440]   Father, would you help us to look forward to prayer.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   God, to look forward to being able to talk to you and to enter into your presence.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:53.440]   And so Lord, tonight we simply want to lift up to you great gratitude.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440]   Thank you God.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440]   Thank you for who you are.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440]   Thank you for what you've done.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.440]   Thank you Lord for your patience.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.440]   Thank you for your love.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.440]   Thank you God for everything that you are and that you give to us.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   Alright, well that's it for tonight. We'll see you on Sunday.
