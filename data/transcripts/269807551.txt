[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.520]   Alright, so last week was a bleak presentation of what sin looks like, at least from God's
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.980]   point of view.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.940]   And all of that obviously was a shadow to kind of teach us about the depth of why His
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.920]   atonement was necessary.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.860]   So chapter 14 is going to move us into that.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.780]   So chapter 13 was a bleak reminder of the devastating effects of leprosy, again ultimately
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.720]   pointing to sin, and for the individual and his friends.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.940]   Leviticus 14 is going to be filled with reminders of hope, talking about restoration, how the
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.700]   healed individual is restored back into the community.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.940]   So these two chapters, chapter 13 and 14, gives us a greater revelation of God's holiness
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.260]   and His mercy in redemption.
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.700]   So you can kind of, in a nutshell, you can see chapter 13 as the law and chapter 14 as
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.420]   the grace, even though they're both talking about Mosaic law and how to deal with leprosy.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.480]   But ultimately chapter 13 is about identifying and to see this disease and how hideous it
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.980]   is and how to identify it to make this sin utterly sinful, chapter 13.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.500]   And so chapter 14 is bringing us to how to restore once you identify that possibly that
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.140]   there is, God has healed them and that He's able to be restored back into the community.
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.380]   And so these are all instructions on what procedures to take to bring them back into
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.660]   the community.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.420]   You know what's interesting was this week, as I was doing devotions through various passages,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.940]   you know, one of the things that really stood out to me is in 2 Timothy, 1 and 2 Timothy,
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.700]   he starts a letter by saying, "Grace, mercy, and peace."
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.180]   John used that same introduction, "Grace, mercy, and peace."
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.620]   In other parts, Paul introduces the letters by saying, "Grace and peace to you."
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.900]   But in those three particular letters, it says, "Grace, mercy, and peace."
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.900]   And even this morning I was meditating on that, you know, like grace and peace is typically
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.220]   what we understand the gospel to be.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.720]   So Jews spent, you know, hundreds of years like introducing themselves and seeking the
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.940]   peace of God, shalom of God.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.820]   And then Christ comes and He brings this peace, not by the law, but by grace.
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.780]   But the addition of the word mercy, you know, I think it's crucial that if we're never at
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.860]   a point where we require God's mercy, we won't really understand His grace.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.380]   Meaning, if we've never been desperate to overcome our sin, if we've never been desperate
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.260]   because you see the depth of our sin and it's completely beyond our help, if we've never
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.860]   come to that point, grace is just going to feel like a Christmas gift.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.980]   You didn't deserve it, you didn't earn it, but somebody gave it to you.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.460]   And we get that every single year.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.620]   Somebody is gracious to us and they give us something we didn't deserve.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.260]   But the grace that Christ points to is much deeper than just a Christmas gift.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.300]   Just He gave you a gift that you didn't deserve.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.020]   It was the whole point of the Mosaic Law was to bring us to a point where we were desperate
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.020]   for Him.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.020]   Right?
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.980]   And that was the whole point of chapter 13.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.340]   Imagine if you or somebody you knew was diagnosed with this skin disease, how devastating the
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.380]   news would have been.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.140]   And if that person was sent out of the gate and he couldn't even be around you, because
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.960]   if you were around him, you would become unclean.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.780]   So as soon as he was diagnosed, it was no different than being diagnosed for death.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.940]   In fact, if you consider what chapter 13 says, it would have been easier to just die than
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.900]   to go outside of the camp and live the way a leopard would have had to live.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.040]   So chapter 14 brings us, once the devastating news has been given, chapter 14 brings us
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.420]   to the restoration of that.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.340]   And again, it's a clear presentation of where the Mosaic Law brings us to recognize the
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.500]   depth of our sin.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.380]   And then when the gospel comes, when we say that Christ saved us by His grace, that this
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.500]   mercy, again, not just simply a Christmas gift, something that we didn't deserve, but
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.180]   how does somebody live when you are a recipient of mercy?
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.960]   And we're going to be talking about that later.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.540]   And I think, again, the challenge that we have in living our Christian lives, and especially
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.980]   if you've been a Christian for a while, that we know it's grace mentally, but maybe we
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.780]   have a tendency to drift from what it is that we've really been saved from.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.620]   And so therefore, the response that we give to God becomes just a routine thing that we
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.340]   say.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.640]   But it is not a celebration.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.140]   Our worship is not a celebration.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.140]   It is not a thanking and running to Him.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.780]   So again, chapter 13 and 14, again, is a clear message of what God had embedded into the
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.140]   gospel message about the condemnation of sin and what it looks like to be delivered from
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.140]   that.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.900]   So that's chapter 13 and chapter 14.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.700]   God prescribed no treatment for the cure of leprosy here.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.200]   So He's not describing in chapter 14, this is how to cure this man or a woman.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.340]   So what we see in chapter 14 is how to recognize when God healed this person.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.620]   So He's not doing anything to cure him.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.460]   He doesn't say to wash and make sure he's isolated and put certain kind of medicine
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.780]   on him.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.920]   The priest is sent out simply to identify if a healing took place.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.620]   So the affected individual was at the mercy of God to heal him.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.060]   The chapter explains how the priests and the Israelites could recognize healed skin so
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.100]   that the formerly afflicted individuals could resume worship in the community.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.220]   So in other words, there was no cure for this, at least not prescribed in the Mosaic law.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.300]   He's not saying like, if this happens, make sure you follow these procedures and this
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.140]   is going to help him to get to be restored.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.140]   When somebody had leprosy, all they could do is wait to die.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.940]   So they were probably, I'm guessing if you were a leper in the Jewish community, that
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.940]   I would think from morning to evening that you were praying.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.820]   That's all you could do because you can't even evangelize.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.300]   You can't tell other people about God because you can't even get near them.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.540]   So I would think that all they thought about from morning till night is that God would
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.380]   have mercy and answer their prayer and bring healing.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.900]   So chapter 14 is the answer to this desperate person's prayer that if they believe that
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.220]   God cured them from this disease, then they would call the priest.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.680]   So again, Jeremiah 13, 23 says, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or leopard his spots?
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.120]   Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil."
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:16.440]   So again, this is a clear picture to us that a sinner cannot will himself to stop sinning.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:23.480]   Because if sin is originating from our heart, if murder is hatred, if adultery is the lust
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.280]   in our hearts, how do you stop lusting?
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.080]   How do you just say, "I'm not going to be bitter anymore," and just disappear?
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:38.000]   So when we recognize the sin that is embedded in us, the only remedy to that is God himself.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.600]   He's the only one who can actually change it.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   So we were talking about that this morning, or actually I was having a conversation with
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.480]   Pastor Mark today about discipleship.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.080]   And if we're not careful, we think that if we apply certain type of discipleship to everybody
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.240]   that there's going to be the same result from so many people.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.560]   The way to raise leaders is to put them through this program.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:07.000]   And if they're exposed to a certain type of material, that certain number of leaders are
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.320]   going to just come out of that.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   Discipleship doesn't work.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   The people just don't change like that.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.880]   It's an act of God.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.880]   The scripture clearly says that we can plant, you can water, but only God's the one who
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.020]   can make somebody grow.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:28.400]   So number two, there is no treatment for sin outside of Christ.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.960]   There's no lasting change.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.560]   There's no answer for sin outside of Christ.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.760]   We're completely dependent on his mercy.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   And that's what this disease ultimately shows us.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.080]   It says, "If the one who has declared to have leprosy believes that he had been healed of
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.440]   the disease, the priest could be summoned to go outside the camp."
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.880]   He doesn't walk into the camp because he's not allowed until he is declared to be clean.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.320]   So the priest would go outside where he is to meet him.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.880]   So the diseased person had to stay not to contaminate those inside the camp, to carefully
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.000]   examine if that was the case.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   So again, we see a clear picture of the gospel in Hebrews 13, 11 says, "For the bodies of
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.520]   those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.240]   for sin are burned outside the camp."
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.940]   And then he calls us that Jesus Christ was crucified outside the camp, that we ought
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.560]   to go also outside the camp.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   So it's a picture of Christ coming for those who have been shunned outside the camp to
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.040]   come and rescue us.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.400]   And that's the picture of the priest here in chapter 14, right?
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   Somebody who is condemned by this disease, again, ultimately pointing to sin, that the
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.360]   priest representing Christ would come to get us outside the camp.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.120]   So again, every part of this obviously is a clear presentation of the gospel.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:05.440]   But Leviticus is such a detailed, meticulous, pointing...
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.680]   I mean, you can see so clearly how it points to Christ and what he has done for us.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.840]   He doesn't just say he loved us, he describes it.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.600]   He doesn't just say we've sinned, he describes these sins.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.800]   He doesn't just say he's atoned for our sins, he describes how he atoned for it, what he
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.100]   atoned for, right?
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.080]   He doesn't just say, you know, sin is missing the mark, he describes the ugliness of sin,
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.120]   the effect of sin.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.440]   Effects on ourselves, effect on our houses, it affects on our children, our neighbors.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.080]   And all of this is for a reason, right?
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.080]   And that's one of the discussion questions I'm already telling you.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.280]   One of the discussion questions that I have for today, if everything that he has done
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.720]   in the Old Testament, so everything that we're talking about and we're going to talk about
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.120]   is a shadow of what was to come.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.080]   He described the shadow in such detail, right?
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:09.920]   Every part of this so that an Israelite who, like, it was in their food, it was in their
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.880]   annual ceremony, it was in the daily sacrifices, it was in their religion, it was in their
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.320]   worship, it was even described in their clothing, where they lived, their housing, how they
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.560]   bathe, how they wash, how they interacted.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.480]   So every part of Israel's life, there was embedding of a certain part of the gospel
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.520]   in their culture.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.320]   All for what purpose?
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.360]   Obviously it points to the cross, we know that.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.680]   But he could have easily just said, you have sin and Christ is going to come to deliver
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.300]   you from that sin.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.520]   But he doesn't just leave it there, right?
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   He doesn't just point to the cross.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:01.080]   He is concerned about every single detailed aspect of what is taking place in the cross.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.200]   What's the purpose of that?
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.680]   The ultimate goal of it is when the cross comes, one, that you can understand the depth
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.220]   of what it is, and second, it's to have a proper response, right?
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.760]   To have a proper response.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.680]   That because he was so meticulous in preparation for the coming of Christ, that our response
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.720]   to the cross should not be, Christ loves me and died for me and has a wonderful plan for
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.960]   my life.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.800]   What else do you have?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.200]   The whole purpose of it is everything pointed to Christ and everything points back to Christ.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.000]   So every single detail, the things that you understand, the things that you don't understand,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.160]   every part of this is to soften your hearts to prepare you for Christ, right?
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.080]   And the reason why I'm sharing this now is chapter 13 and 14 in particular, in chapter
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:01.840]   15, you can easily get lost in all the details and think like, oh, just skim over this.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.920]   But you know that there's a meaning, there's meaning behind it.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.520]   You know there's reasons why this is here, right?
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.840]   God didn't give you all these clear pictures of the cross and then he went to these passages
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.680]   and he's kind of like, you know, these things are just details you don't really need to
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.120]   know, right?
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.240]   So you could understand the cross, but the effects of why he put this here, you're going
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.600]   to completely miss if you just skim over it, right?
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.360]   Because the intent of why chapter 13, chapter 14, chapter 15 is in the Bible, if ultimately
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.920]   is to prepare us to come to the cross and see an aspect of the cross that you would
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.200]   not have understood if you didn't have this are going to be missed.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.680]   And so a superficial preparation for the cross is going to lead to a superficial understanding,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.080]   a superficial understanding leads to superficial application.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.420]   Okay?
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:02.320]   So again, all of this is to encourage you to do your best to pay attention to the details.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.000]   What you understand, what you don't understand, but there's a purpose behind all of it.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.800]   Okay?
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.480]   If the priest determines that the person was healed of the leprosy, then he would take
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.140]   two live clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet yarn and hyssop to prepare the man to reenter
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.680]   the camp.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:29.400]   So he has this ritual that he needs to perform for that person or that person needs to go
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.680]   through.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:38.560]   And so the outline I have here, A, one bird is killed over the fresh water in an earthen
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   vessel, B, a spring of hyssop and a branch of cedar were tied to a live bird and scarlet
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.880]   wool yarn, C, the priest dipped the hyssop, cedar, in the tail of the bird in the blood
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.760]   of and water.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.260]   Then he used a brush to sprinkle the blood on the person's or house seven times and declared
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.260]   them to be clean.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.840]   Then the living bird was released in an open field.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.440]   This is basically a summary of what was commanded for them to do.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.840]   And I think I'm just going to show you a real quick picture so that you can get an idea
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.280]   of what happened.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.360]   Okay.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.640]   So this is what they did basically.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.280]   So everything, I'll turn it back if you haven't filled out the space.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Okay.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.800]   I'll give you time to fill that out.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.880]   But this is just to kind of give you a visual picture to help you understand what was taking
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   place.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.820]   He took two birds, one was killed, the other one was tied to hyssop and with a red yarn
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:43.720]   and then the scarlet on the bottom, which was the red dye, which I'm going to be explaining
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.620]   later, but this is basically, and this is what they took and dipped it into the blood
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.040]   of the first bird.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.280]   And then they would take this and basically wipe it on the individual and sprinkle it
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   on it seven times.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   So let me just go back.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.480]   If you haven't filled it out, you can fill that out.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:07.000]   But that gives you a visual picture of what it is exactly that God told them to do.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.840]   Not done?
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.080]   All right.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:25.120]   So hyssop was also used in the first Passover to paint the door.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.360]   So this is not the first time that this is used.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.960]   In Jewish ceremonies, it represented cleansing.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:42.440]   Whenever you see the word hyssop, it was used to describe some types of cleansing.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.280]   The word used for scarlet literally means the scarlet stuff that comes out of a worm.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.800]   So it was pretty disgusting.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.520]   And that's how they would get the scarlet dye.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.920]   And the dye was commonly used in ceremonial items, most likely referencing blood.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.760]   But it also brings to mind sin, which like blood, draws attention to itself in a cry
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   for healing.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:11.600]   So it symbolized sin, and not just any kind of sin, but it kind of visually pictured the
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.880]   disgusting nature of sin, considering where scarlet came from.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.400]   In Isaiah 118, we see that verse, it says, "Come now, let us reason together."
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.920]   Says the Lord, "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.240]   Though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool."
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:36.080]   So again, so the Bible uses the idea of this scarlet dye, this red dye, that came from
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.280]   basically the blood of a worm, and he's describing that as sin.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.360]   Kind of like in the New Testament, it says, you know, a man who repents and goes back
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.600]   to his sin, he says it's like a dog returning back to what?
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.080]   His vomit, right?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.800]   So the Bible is giving a visual picture of how disgusting sin is.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   It seems so attractive when we're tempted, but in God's eyes, it's basically like scarlet,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   it's like vomit, right?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.720]   And so that's the picture that is given to us in the Scripture.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.020]   Cedar is a branch of juniper bush, which is known for its medicinal properties.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.420]   In the Jewish tradition, it symbolizes human pride.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.600]   So other parts of Scripture, when it talks about cedar, oftentimes it's referencing human
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.760]   pride.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.740]   So God is using all these different symbols that he's used all throughout different parts
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:31.640]   of Scripture to describe this, again, all of this ceremony ultimately pointing to the
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.600]   cross.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.540]   While the meaning of the birds aren't directly explained, their symbolism seems pretty clear,
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.800]   because if you've read it, you know, it says that you have two birds, and you kill one,
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.160]   and the other one ultimately after it dips its blood and sprinkle, and then it is released.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.480]   So what does that sound like to you?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.480]   Day of Atonement, right?
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.000]   So that's exactly, when we get to chapter 16, we'll talk about that more in detail.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.040]   And there's a lot of details in the Day of Atonement that most people don't understand,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.960]   that we're going to be talking about by the time we get there, but it seems like a very
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.540]   similar, at least symbolism-wise, right?
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.720]   So sacrifice of one bird and the release of the other one represented the largest sacrifice
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.320]   given at the Day of Atonement with two goats.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.920]   So remember what happens?
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:28.020]   One goat, you bring two goats at the Day of Atonement, you lay your hand on one, representing
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:35.640]   the sin of Israel, and then the one that symbolizes the sin of Israel is slaughtered.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.120]   And then the other one, which is called what kind of goat?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.640]   Scapegoat, that's where we get the word scapegoat.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.880]   So the scapegoat is released into the wilderness, representing the sin being cast out or being
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   released, right?
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.560]   And so that's what it seems like that this is symbolizing, even though it doesn't describe
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.120]   it that way.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.640]   But one is sacrificed on behalf of the leper, and the other one is released because his
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.920]   sin is sacrificed.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.680]   Again, pointing and preparing for the Day of Atonement, right?
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.480]   Remember the chiastic form we talked about, that all of it, ultimately, it's going to
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.460]   culminate in chapter 16?
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.320]   So all of this is going to help us to understand the Day of Atonement, okay?
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.560]   So keep that in mind.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.960]   So all of these little details is going to help us understand the main thesis of the
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.680]   point that he's trying to get to, right?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   Before I get to that.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.880]   So it's kind of similar to how the whole Bible is organized, right?
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.660]   Genesis to Matthew, ultimately culminates to the cross, and then the rest of the New
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.780]   Testament is pointing back to the cross, right?
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.260]   So that's how Leviticus is.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:52.820]   Chapter 15 chapters, ultimately all preparing for the cross, and then chapter 17, 18, all
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:21:00.180]   the way to chapter 27, pointing back to the atonement, right?
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.500]   So in 2 Corinthians 5.21, it says, "For our sake He made him to be sin who knew no sin,
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.540]   so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.220]   And that's the ceremony that is portrayed here for us.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:20.100]   One bird is released because of the sacrifice of the other, which again, clearly points
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.140]   to what Christ did for us.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.760]   And then after the ritual cleansing, the person will be required to shave all of his hair
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.700]   before he re-enters into the camp.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.020]   Why do you think God made him do that?
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.140]   Or her?
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.540]   I think for two obvious reasons.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.460]   It doesn't spell it out for us for two reasons.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.500]   One, this was a skin disease, right?
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.580]   So you want to make sure.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.220]   You want to make sure that the skin disease is clean.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.260]   I think the other part of it was, and He made him do it twice.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.980]   He made him do it initially, and then after seven, eight days, he needed to shave again,
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.980]   right?
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.500]   I think the point of it was, one, is to make sure that the skin disease, that you didn't
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.780]   miss any part of it, that even though the skin that you can see was clean, maybe the
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.420]   other parts of it, even the eyebrows had to be shaved off, right?
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.180]   Was to make sure that the skin disease was completely clean.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:20.140]   I think the other part of it was to show the rest of the community that he was clean, right?
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.780]   Because remember, you probably don't remember, but a long time ago when AIDS was going around
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.020]   and people didn't know anything about AIDS, people were afraid to even sit where the people
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.660]   who had AIDS, you know, who had AIDS.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.860]   So again, you know, most of you probably don't remember when Magic Johnson, you know, had
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.180]   this, the HIV, there was a big controversy in the NBA that whether he should be playing
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.620]   or not playing.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.180]   So can you imagine something like HIV that they didn't know, and it wasn't visual, it
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.580]   was just internal, but somebody who had leprosy coming back into town, even though he was
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.420]   declared to be clean, how people would have treated him, right?
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.900]   I think they would have been afraid, even though he might have been ceremonially clean,
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.900]   right?
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.140]   I think so part of the reason why was to show everybody that he's been cleaned, right?
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:17.460]   That he's actually reentering.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.340]   So once the sacrifices were made for the leprous individual, he would be able to reenter the
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.100]   camp, but he had to wait seven days to be fully cleared and had to sleep outside the
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.100]   tent.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.980]   So he had this long process, right?
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.740]   From the moment he's declared to be unclean, they go through the ceremony, making sure,
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.340]   giving seven, eight days to see if this thing comes back, he has to shave it all off.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.820]   But once he's declared unclean, he's outside of the camp, and majority of them probably
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.260]   just lived in isolation and died.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:55.440]   The few of them who happen to be healed is this elaborate process of reentering back
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.300]   into the camp, right?
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.940]   So again, I'm not going to say it, but I want you to think about what all of this points
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:07.300]   to in our salvation.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.620]   It wasn't pointless.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.540]   It wasn't purposeless.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.700]   So I want you to think about that.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.980]   So every part of this, even if we're not clear, like why did God make them do this?
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:22.420]   What does this ultimately point to?
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.700]   So he wasn't allowed to go directly into the tent.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:31.800]   He had to, even after he entered the camp, he had to stay outside to make sure.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.900]   On the eighth day, if during the seven days that he entered back into the camp, that the
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:44.220]   disease did not come back, and after he went through the ceremony, then the final ceremony
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:50.020]   is for him to offer up a male lamb without blemish, make two male lambs without blemish,
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.860]   and one ewe lamb to give as a sacrifice to atone for his sins.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:04.140]   So if you read the passage, you'll see that what are the five sacrifices that we talked
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.900]   about in the beginning of the Book of Leviticus?
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.900]   Burnt offering?
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   Grain offering?
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.900]   Sin offering?
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   Guilt offering?
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.540]   And peace offering, okay?
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.580]   Not in that order, but those five offerings.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:27.020]   Which offerings were commanded for this person to reenter?
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:35.700]   So, sir, say it again.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.900]   I didn't hear the full part of what you said.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.900]   Okay.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.060]   So, every offering except for the peace offering, right?
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.100]   So every offering had to be given in order to be reinstated.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.740]   So obviously, burnt offering.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.780]   Burnt offering was the general atonement, right?
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.120]   And what was the grain offering?
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.980]   In what occasion did they give the grain offering?
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.460]   What?
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.620]   No, the grain offering.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.220]   Like, what was the occasion?
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.660]   Yeah, burnt offering was given before the grain offering, but what was the occasion
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.340]   that grain offering was given?
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:20.580]   First fruits, and what did the first fruit represent?
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.020]   It was either you were taking some kind of a vow, or it was an act of dedicating, like
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.340]   lordship, right?
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.940]   That's where the first fruit comes from.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.700]   So it was a symbol of dedication.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.260]   Like this is my whole life belongs to you.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.660]   I'm giving a portion of it to represent all that I have.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.540]   So that was the grain offering, right?
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:45.980]   And what was the sin offering?
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.860]   Unintentional sins, right?
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.340]   You might have defiled yourself.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.940]   Maybe, you know, there was a leper, and you ran into them by accident, and as a result,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.320]   you became unclean.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.740]   So the sin offering was to restore that.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.700]   Or you touched something holy that you shouldn't have touched, and so you had to give an offering
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.140]   for that, right?
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.500]   So that was the sin offering.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.100]   And then you had the guilt offering.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.500]   What was the guilt offering for?
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.260]   Some kind of damage that you did, right?
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.860]   You've taken someone else's animal, and you've made it unholy, and as a result of that, they
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.340]   call that reparation, right?
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.100]   So you have to give a fifth of whatever damage you did, and you have to give the offering,
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.340]   and then restore the fifth.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.620]   Remember?
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.620]   Right?
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.460]   Peace offering was an offering that you gave as a, what?
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.900]   What's another word for peace offering?
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.900]   Fellowship offering?
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.640]   Thanksgiving offering, right?
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.500]   And so that offering was given a free will offering, meaning it was not mandated.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.220]   God wanted you to bring it when you were filled with abundance of joy.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.680]   Maybe God, you know, healed you.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.020]   So you would think that of all the offerings, that peace offering would be at the core of
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.300]   this offering, but peace is the only one that's not mentioned here.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.620]   All the other offerings are given except for the peace offering.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.380]   Right?
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.220]   Why is that?
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.460]   If you understand what is taking place, it would only make sense because the Thanksgiving
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.300]   offering, right?
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:29.900]   Thanksgiving offering was a free will offering, meaning that God wanted the individual, it
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.020]   was not mandated for his atonement.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.140]   It was given as an act of worship to God.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.140]   Right?
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.900]   It was an act of worship to God.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:47.580]   So after he gave all of these sacrifices, my guess is peace offering was probably given.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.540]   That's my guess.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:56.180]   If you were basically condemned to die, and then pretty much you came back to life because
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:01.260]   God healed you, if there was any occasion to give a peace offering, it would have been
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.780]   at this time.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.740]   If there was any occasion for the families to get together and celebrate, it was probably
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.740]   this time.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.740]   Right?
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.940]   And remember what we talked about?
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.540]   What does the peace offering point to?
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:19.020]   A very significant thing that we do in the church that Christ mandated, what does the
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:24.180]   peace offering point to in the New Testament?
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.180]   Communion.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.180]   Right?
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.300]   It's a communion.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.880]   So it's to celebrate what Christ has done, and it was meant to be done in the context
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.180]   of the community.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.180]   Right?
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.380]   It was not meant to be done in isolation.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:48.940]   So in order for this individual who was, again, lost in this disease, again, spiritually in
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.500]   his sin, to be restored back, all the other sacrifices needed to be made, except for the
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.580]   peace offering.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.180]   The priest then applied the blood from the sacrifice to the right ear, thumb, right hand,
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.980]   and the toe, and the right foot of the former leper, symbolizing sanctification of his hearing,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.300]   serving, walking by the atoning blood.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.940]   Where else did you see this?
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.940]   Anybody remember?
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:27.940]   What other part of the sacrifice did you see the specifics of the right ear, the toe?
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.940]   What?
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.940]   Consecration of the priest.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.580]   When they were being ordained to serve at the temple or at the tabernacle, they did
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.580]   the exact same thing.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.180]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:46.220]   That each part, right, of them being blessed was to prepare them for service.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.220]   Right?
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.860]   So in order for this individual's cleanse, he doesn't just, the burnt offering obviously
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.860]   atones for his sins, but the specific dabbing of the blood symbolized that they're able
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.740]   to now enter back into society.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.940]   Maybe not as a priest, right, but as he comes back into the society, that now he can function.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.060]   He can walk, he can speak, he can hear.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:12.740]   So every part of who he is is restored.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.180]   Right?
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.540]   The second part of it is the oil.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.500]   Oil was also applied to the cleansed leopard.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.660]   It was both the sprinkling on his blood, on the body in general, and then applied to the
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.340]   ear, thumb, and toe just as the blood was.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.180]   Each of these places on the body was meant to be anointed with oil.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:41.940]   So the blood, the cleansing from the blood basically signified atoning, covering his
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:49.260]   sin with the blood, and oil oftentimes symbolized anointing, dedication.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.660]   So this individual who's entering back into the community, not only is his sins covered,
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.180]   but he's anointed now to serve God in the community.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:07.300]   Again, I want you to keep asking yourself, what does this point to in the new covenant?
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:14.860]   Because they all have meaning.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.300]   So diagnosis of leprosy in a house and cleansing in the house infested with leprosy.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.500]   So not only did the cleansing have to take place in the individual, he said the second
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.920]   it had to take place even in the home.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.340]   So I'm not going to go through all the details of the cleansing of the home, but basically
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.940]   if they see a molding or discoloration and they think that that may have been some kind
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.980]   of infection that was spreading in the home, that the first stage is to identify it, second
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.620]   is to scrape it off, give it some time, and then if that doesn't work and they go through
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.900]   another stage and they scrape more of it off, and if that doesn't work, what were they to
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   do?
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.820]   Tear down the building, right?
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:58.380]   Where before, remember chapter 13, if an individual had that, what did they do with the clothes?
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.040]   They burned it.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   So same thing with the home.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:06.900]   If the home that he was to enter back into was infected and then they can't get rid of
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.420]   it, the end result was they had to tear it down.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.900]   So the fact that the certain abnormal conditions afflicted houses as well as persons reminded
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:24.300]   Israelites that their dwelling places as well as their bodies needed to be holy.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:34.420]   So in other words, every part of where God's people dwelt also needed to be holy.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:42.280]   So that's why when God's presence came in to the community where the core of his presence
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.100]   was obviously at the tabernacle, and in the tabernacle you had the holy of holies, right,
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:54.520]   where it was concentrated, but anywhere where God dwelt, there had to be wholeness, holiness.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.760]   It wasn't just the people.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.880]   It was the animals, the articles, and even the houses and the clothing.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.780]   They had to be set apart for God.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:08.360]   So if there was any infection or any kind of disease or any sign of some kind of disease
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:14.300]   in the home, even though the home had to be torn down.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.240]   And God presided the same right of purification using two birds, cedars, scarlet strings,
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.440]   and hyssop for the house, for the person.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.000]   Again, so the same kind of cleansing ritual had to go through even for the house once
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.080]   it's declared to be clean.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:38.580]   Obviously he did not require sacrifice for the home because the sacrifices was ultimately
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.600]   pointing to atonement.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.160]   So there's no sin involved, right?
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.300]   It needed cleansing, but not atoning.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:51.680]   So that part, everything else looks the same except for the sacrifice part.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:59.720]   And then finally, chapter 14, 54 to 57 is just a summary of what he says.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:07.900]   It's to draw the conclusion to all of this.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:14.580]   So again, I want you to emotionally and mentally consider what this individual has gone through
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.940]   from chapter 13 to chapter 14.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.380]   I mean, in all practical purposes, he died and came back to life.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.920]   I mean, think about it emotionally.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:37.420]   If the moment they said you had leprosy, kind of like today, if you have stage four cancer,
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.420]   you have some hope.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.660]   But for the most part, stage four cancer, at the late part of stage four cancer, you
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.380]   knew that there's not a lot of hope, at least not medically.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.860]   And so you can have all these experiments done.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.700]   But imagine if you had leprosy.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.940]   It wasn't just internal rotting and you're going to have a hard time and you're going
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.940]   to pass.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.060]   I mean, just it was external.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.780]   So all the rotting took place and it was seen visually.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:06.780]   They said they could actually smell a leper before he was coming into town.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.460]   He had to constantly scream, "Unclean, unclean," everywhere he went.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.860]   And if he even by accident came too close to somebody, by Mosaic law, he could be stoned
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.340]   to death.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.900]   So you can see why these 10 lepers, when they saw Jesus coming into town, they ran to him
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.380]   and they begged him, "Have mercy on us.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.900]   Have mercy on us."
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:36.460]   And then when Jesus says to go show yourself to the priest, right, he was following the
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.140]   Mosaic law because the only way that they can get restored back is to be confirmed by
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.140]   the priest, by the law.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.340]   So the nine go and the one come back.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:51.380]   So the only person that gave thanksgiving is that one.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:56.580]   The other nine were so eager to be restored, right, they completely forget about like who
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.100]   it is and they forget to thank Jesus and only one comes back.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.260]   And as a result of that, what does he say?
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.180]   You have been healed, right?
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.500]   Even though all 10 were healed with leprosy, Jesus says only to that one person, you've
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.820]   been healed.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.980]   Because ultimately, all of this ultimately points to sin and atonement in the blood of
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:22.700]   Christ, right?
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:33.820]   So again, just the depth that God goes through to make what he has done and what he has done
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:41.260]   for us so crystal clear, right, that we do not just have some superficial elementary
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.140]   understanding of the cross.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.540]   And all of this is to point us, it's like, yes, when you read chapter 13, if you read
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:53.020]   it with the lens of the New Testament, New Covenant, what Jesus says and what Hebrew
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:59.100]   says, we should read chapter 13 like this is me, right?
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.280]   Go back and read chapter 13 and understand this as your sin.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.320]   This is you, right?
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.800]   This is the state that we were in and then go back and read chapter 14 and understand
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.420]   this as Christ's atonement for our sins and restoration, right?
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:21.060]   Because that's what it ultimately is and all of this are like kind of a preview of the
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.300]   big picture coming in the day of atonement, right?
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.540]   So far, he's given us bits and pieces and then it's going to lead us to chapter 16,
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:33.460]   who's going to use the clearest picture of Christ crucified is coming up in chapter 16.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.620]   All for what purpose?
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:41.540]   So that we may respond in genuine worship, right?
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:47.100]   So again, as we wrap up and I'm going to, you know, ask you guys to take some time to
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:53.460]   have discussion in your small group, even the things that I didn't mention, just kind
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.180]   of think to yourself, like, what do you think this ultimately points to?
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.980]   What are the details here that you might have just skimmed through?
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.940]   Like, what do you think it ultimately points to, right?
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:11.020]   Because if you're a doctor, we would automatically assume that if we had any medical questions
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.740]   that you're the one that we go to, right?
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.780]   But if we come to you and say, like, what medicine should I take?
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.740]   He's like, I don't know.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.580]   If I have a fever, what should I do?
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.580]   I don't know.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.760]   I wasn't paying attention when that class was taught, right?
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.740]   So if that was the case, after a while, you're going to say, what kind of doctor are you?
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   You're the expert.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.940]   If you're a lawyer and we have a question about the law and we come to you and say,
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.940]   hey, is this legal to do this?
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.940]   Like, I don't know.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.660]   I thought you were a lawyer.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.660]   I am.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.160]   But I'm not an expert.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.660]   If you're not an expert, then who is?
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:52.080]   So if a Christian isn't an expert of the gospel, then who is?
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.060]   If we don't have the answers to the detailed questions that a non-Christian would ask,
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.060]   who do they go to, right?
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:04.160]   So every single Christian should be an expert of why Christ had to come.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.660]   Why did he have to shed his blood?
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.980]   Why not just snap his finger and forgive?
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.260]   Why all this drama of the cross?
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.400]   Why the blood?
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.940]   Why aren't we saved and to go to heaven?
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.180]   What is this whole process of sanctification for?
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.140]   What's the purpose of the church?
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.220]   Why are we gathered together?
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.580]   Why did he establish elders here?
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.900]   Why did he give his word?
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.760]   Christians ought to be the experts of this.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.500]   So there's a reason behind all of this.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.340]   So even some of this, a lot of stuff you may not understand, but I hope that you study
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:45.820]   it as if you're a lawyer studying the law, because in essence we are to the world.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.020]   Let me read this passage.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.780]   Ephesians 2, 1-7 says, "And you are dead in your trespasses and sins in which you once
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.340]   walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.580]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience, among whom we all once lived
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.340]   in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.180]   were by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:14.100]   But God, being rich in mercy because of great love with which he loved us, even when we
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.660]   were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:24.060]   saved and raises us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.340]   Jesus so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.020]   in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.700]   I think chapter 13 and 14 clearly points to this.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.940]   So the three questions that I have, how do you think these cleansed lepers felt once
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.940]   they were completely cleared to enter back into community and live a normal life?
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.900]   Do you think your salvation felt anything remotely close to what they might have felt?
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.900]   Why or why not?
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.060]   Okay, so that question is pretty clear.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:59.500]   Now I'm not asking in question one, did you have some charismatic experience?
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.900]   Like I'm not asking that, right?
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:08.620]   But somebody who was dead and raised to life, you would think that there will be some difference,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.820]   right?
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:16.020]   You would think that there would be an obvious difference between dead and being alive, right?
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:22.140]   So the question is, how did you see the difference, right?
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.740]   Maybe you didn't fully understand what happened.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.700]   You know, maybe now you understand it.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.020]   Maybe at some point you understood it.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.580]   But at one point the understanding that you were dead and then because of Christ you were
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.380]   made alive, how does that affect you?
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.700]   Number two, have you ever been punished for something you did not do?
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.700]   How did you feel and what was your reaction?
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.780]   What do you think was the state of mind and heart when Jesus took on himself the punishment
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.060]   he did not deserve?
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.820]   So again, the question is, if the whole point of the atonement is somebody who did not deserve
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.300]   it absorbing the sin for those who deserved it, right?
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.660]   And of course we look at that and say, man, that's awesome.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.520]   God's love is so awesome.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.580]   When was the last time you were punished for something you didn't do?
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:10.180]   I mean, me being the middle child of three boys, it was a regular thing in my life.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.380]   At least that's what I thought, right?
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.980]   Anything happened in our home, it was my fault.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.000]   At least that's what I thought.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.220]   So I can, I think very vividly, I have memories of times when it was like, that wasn't me.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.420]   I didn't do that.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.020]   He's not crying because of me, right?
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:30.340]   And I remember saying that often to my parents, especially to my mom.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.460]   And never once did I feel good about it.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.620]   You know, oh, I took it for Philip.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:41.620]   No matter how much I loved him, I took it for Philip, you know, or I, you know, I took
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.620]   the punishment.
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.140]   He didn't deserve it.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:48.920]   I didn't deserve, but he deserved it, but I feel good about it, right?
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:57.020]   How do you think Jesus felt as he was being punished for being righteous and he volunteered,
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   right?
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:05.980]   So the whole point of our atonement is the innocent, the complete, right, without blemish,
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:13.820]   without sin, being punished for those who are with defect, with leprosy, with sin, who
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:20.100]   cheated, the murderers, the tax collectors, the adulterers, the prostitutes, right?
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:25.020]   They go free and the righteous is punished because that's what the gospel ultimately
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.020]   is.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.780]   That's what the atonement points to, and that's what this sacrifice ultimately points
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.620]   to, right?
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.100]   You grew up in the church all your life and we didn't really calculate it in thinking,
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.660]   and we weren't emotionally attached to things that we profess to believe.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:46.980]   Because I think if we did, we would wrestle more with the meaning of the gospel, right?
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.780]   Instead of asking, why does God allow, you know, bad things to happen to good people,
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.780]   I don't think that's the question that you'd be asking.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:45:00.540]   It's like, why would a good, righteous, holy, perfect God take upon himself sin for the
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.620]   unrighteous?
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.260]   That's a bigger mystery.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.100]   I know why bad things happen to people.
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.740]   I know why bad things happen to people, because we make dumb choices, because we're sinners,
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.320]   we're selfish, we're prideful.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.940]   So I know why there's evil in the world, because I can see the decisions that led us to get
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.300]   there.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.180]   So even though we think they're innocent, but nobody, I've never really met anybody
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.460]   innocent.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.060]   The degree is different, but I've never met anybody who wasn't sinful.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:35.960]   I've never met anybody who wasn't prideful, not even my youngest children.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:40.740]   So I understand why there's punishment and disasters in the world.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.060]   It's not that hard to understand.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:53.300]   So why would a perfect God, without blemish, completely holy, take upon the sins of the
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.460]   tax collector, of the proud, of the murderer?
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.060]   That's the mystery.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.500]   That's the mystery of the cross.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.140]   So ultimately, everything that we're studying really ultimately points to this, the righteous
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.220]   for the unrighteous, the righteous for the unrighteous, the righteous for the unrighteous.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.860]   Number three, why do you think God went through so much trouble in implanting the gospel message
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.660]   so deeply, intricately into every fabric of Israel's daily life?
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.220]   Have you ever prepared anything in your life to this degree?
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.700]   What was it, and why did you do that?
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:35.420]   So again, the point of why I ask this is to get you to think deeply about, he went through
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:41.620]   all this trouble, sending his prophets, setting up the tabernacle, all the animals, all the
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:49.260]   sacrifices, the priesthood, the festivals, all of it, ultimately to give a clear picture
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.100]   of the cross.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:59.960]   So the question behind this is, have you ever prepared anything to that detail?
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.700]   How did you feel after you've done that?
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:07.620]   I remember, and I'm just going to give you an example of it so you can know what to discuss.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.600]   I remember years ago, not at this church, but another church when I was the EM pastor,
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.060]   we decided to have a sisters appreciation retreat.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.820]   And so I got a bunch of the guys to come up, and the sisters were having their retreat,
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.900]   and we were in the background cooking for them.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.780]   So for a two-day retreat, we cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and we thought that we're
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   going to have this big finale.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.560]   And so about seven, eight guys stayed up literally all night.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.420]   They went to sleep around 12 o'clock.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:41.660]   So we stayed up from 12 to 5 in the morning, and we just blew up balloons, like hundreds
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.580]   of balloons.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.860]   And we didn't sleep till about 5 in the morning, and they all started waking up about 6.30.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:48.860]   And so we were excited.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:55.400]   We all, after five hours of blowing balloons, and the room was maybe knee-deep with balloons
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   all over.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.020]   And so our big surprise was the finale was when they opened the door, they're going to
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.020]   see the balloons.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:05.660]   Oh my gosh, I can't believe you guys stayed up all night and blew these balloons.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:11.860]   So they wake up at 6.30 in the morning, and we're all eager, and they open the door, and
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:17.020]   they look at all the balloons, and they're like, ah, balloons.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.420]   And then they went back to sleep.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:25.160]   And I remember every single one of us was like, oh my gosh, we did this all night for
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.160]   five hours.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.180]   We're never doing this again.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.180]   They didn't appreciate.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.300]   They didn't realize how much time and effort.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.340]   My lungs were hurting after five hours.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.340]   But their response was like, oh, thanks, thanks.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.260]   It's like, this is so corny.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.260]   Balloons?
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.820]   That was the response.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:54.820]   That made such a-- again, when I think about underappreciating, I always think about that.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.020]   I'm just giving you an example.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:04.060]   If you put that much time and effort to prepare as a gift to give to somebody, and the recipient
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:13.260]   of that gift is, thank you, and that's the response that we give, it'd be an understatement
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.580]   to say it's an inappropriate response.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.540]   That's why in chapter 12, it says, in view of this mercy to offer your body as a living
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.540]   sacrifice, which is your what?
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   Reasonable act of worship.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.860]   Reasonable act of response to what God has given.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:35.340]   So everything that we've been studying up to this point is an explanation of how he's
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:41.020]   preparing mankind to meet Christ on the cross.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.660]   So we shouldn't just skim through this.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.740]   We shouldn't just look at this kind of nonchalantly.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.940]   This is something that we should dig and question.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:53.260]   And even if you don't have the answers for it, at least contemplate and think and meditate.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.380]   Because he put this here for a reason.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:01.100]   Let me pray for us and I'll get you guys into your small groups.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.860]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.900]   And I pray, Father God, that during our small group time that you would bless our discussion,
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.820]   that it would lead to greater understanding of the cross and what you've done.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:20.380]   Lord, as we examine the skin disease, Lord God, that was so devastating, and how it ultimately
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:25.820]   points to sin and the ugliness and the damage that it does.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:32.580]   Help us to recognize ourselves in this law and also to recognize what it is that we have
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.500]   been given in Christ.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.020]   I pray that you would help us to be fruitful in our discussion.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.020]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.020]   Amen.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.860]   Amen.
