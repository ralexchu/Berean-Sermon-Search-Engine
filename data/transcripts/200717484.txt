[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Let me read the passage and then we're going to jump into the text this morning.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.200]   Romans chapter 8, 36 through 39.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.320]   As it is written, "For your sake we are being killed all the day long.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.600]   We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.040]   Knowing all these things, we are more than conquerors.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.080]   Through him who loved us, for I am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.360]   nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.280]   in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840]   Let's pray.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.980]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for this day.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.080]   We know that it is only by your grace that we are attracted to you, that we long to hear
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.560]   from you, that we desire to worship and honor you.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.160]   We pray, Father God, that the Holy Spirit that you've made to dwell in us, that as it
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.200]   continues to intercede, as he continues to pray on our behalf, help us, Lord God, to
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.920]   join him in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.880]   Help us to have open ears, sensitive hearts, and willing life, Lord God, to obey all that
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.880]   you have.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   Amen.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.480]   As you guys know, as we've been studying through the book of Romans, we're at the conclusion
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.400]   of one major section in the book of Romans.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.080]   Chapter 9 through chapter 11, he's going to be expounding about his faithfulness and the
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.840]   illustration of how the promise that he made to the nation of Israel, God's not going to
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.440]   renege on that and he's going to continue to be faithful.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.000]   And so that's the subject matter in chapter 9 through 11, his faithfulness.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.920]   But as we've been talking about, Paul has been arguing this point of our assurance of
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.220]   salvation.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.280]   Why we can have absolute confidence and assurance, not because of what we've done, not because
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.940]   of being clever or any kind of training, but because God had intended from the very beginning
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.760]   that he who began a good work, that he will carry us into completion until the day of
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.560]   Christ.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.240]   So naturally, the argument that he's been building up to is the reason why we have assurance
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   is because God loves us.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.480]   Verse 35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.320]   Will it be tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, or danger, or sore?"
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.960]   So the natural question when we hear this is, if God loved us and that he's going to
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.580]   protect us from all of these things, then why is there suffering in the world?
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.400]   Maybe you have thought that, maybe there's something going on in your life and you're
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.200]   questioning God.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.720]   If God loved me so much that nothing can separate us from his love, then why is this particular
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.920]   thing happening in my life?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.280]   Why is there illness?
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   Why is there suffering?
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.080]   Why is there famine?
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.040]   More particularly in your life?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.320]   Paul knows that that's probably the natural question that's going to come up when we talk
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   about sovereignty.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   If God is sovereign, I mean, is he really sovereign?
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.160]   If he's really sovereign and he's loving, I don't understand what is happening right
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.480]   now in my life and in the world.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.920]   See, Paul already knows that and he's going to conclude the assurance of salvation at
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.120]   the end of chapter 8 to basically bring home the point that this is why suffering happens.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.400]   So the text that we're looking at starting from verse 36 through 39, there's three points
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.280]   that I want you guys to see in this text when Paul's argument is, how do we view suffering
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.240]   through the lens of God's sovereign eyes?
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.720]   The first thing that we want to see that's mentioned in verse 36 and on is, God's love
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.960]   changes the way that we view suffering.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.920]   Again, let me qualify this before I even get to this.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.840]   If all that we're talking about, his love, is just simple theology to you, everything
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.120]   that I'm going to say, everything that Paul's going to say is just going to fall on deaf
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.120]   ears.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   I know it.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.760]   Because it's just theory.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.580]   It's just theory.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.200]   But in order for anything and everything that God is saying about this, about his love,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.480]   that if you truly believed it, that a sovereign God genuinely loves you, a sovereign God who
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.800]   is in absolute control over history, control over you, control over the future, that that
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.400]   God who is all powerful, all knowing, and he's all loving toward you, and you actually
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.120]   believe that, that is not theoretical, it is not a doctrinal statement that you sign,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.880]   but you believe that, then it completely changes everything.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.840]   First thing that he says is that God's love changes our perspective on suffering.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.560]   In verse 36, in response, the rhetorical question of, well, what's going to separate us from
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   the love of Christ?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.280]   None of these things can separate us.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.080]   And then he goes in verse 36, he says, "As it is written," quoting Psalm 44, verse 22,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.740]   "As it is written, for your sake we are being killed all the day long.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.080]   We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.520]   Now, you have to understand verse 36 in the Psalm that he's quoting in the context of
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.080]   what he's quoting, or else you're going to misunderstand what Paul is saying.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.940]   On the surface, it may seem like Paul is saying, "I'm suffering for you."
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.560]   That the reason why I'm suffering for you is because God loves you.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.880]   I mean, that's what it seems like he's saying, it seems to fit the context, at least here.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.160]   But when you look at Psalm 44, you don't need to turn your Bible there, I'm just going to
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.240]   give you a quick summary.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.840]   Psalm 44 is someone who is in anguish, crying out to God, "Why are these things happening
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.020]   to me?"
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.120]   He's basically complaining to God, "I've been faithful to you, I've kept my covenant to
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.880]   you, I've been righteous, and yet these things are happening in my life."
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   And he's asking God.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.040]   So it's a lot like the book of Job, where Job was targeted because of his righteousness,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.120]   not despite.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.960]   It wasn't despite the fact that he was righteous, God allowed this to happen.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.080]   He was targeted because he was righteous.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.520]   He said, "Have you considered my servant, who is upright?"
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.880]   And he was targeted as a result of his righteousness.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.240]   Well, that's what it's saying, and I'm going to read Psalm 44, 17-22.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.840]   After laying his complaint before God, "Why is suffering happening in my life?
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.120]   All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you."
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.360]   And this is his plea before God.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.880]   "And we have not been false to your covenant, our heart has not turned back, nor have our
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.840]   steps departed from your way.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.400]   Yet you have broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadows of death.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.920]   If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a foreign God, would
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.360]   not God discover this?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.320]   For he knows the secret of the heart."
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.080]   In other words, he's complaining to God, "If I did anything wrong, you would know it, and
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   I know that I can't hide any of this from you.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.280]   But you know, God, that my complaint is genuine.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.880]   You know that I've been living righteously."
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.040]   And then in wrap-up, he says in verse 22, "Yet, for your sake, we are killed all day
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.160]   long.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.920]   He's not saying, "Despite the fact that I've done all of this, why haven't you protected
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.420]   me?"
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.480]   God actually is saying, "It's because you've been faithful.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.120]   Because."
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:36.660]   Now this thought is very unsettling to Christianity, in our generation.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.400]   That because you love Christ, suffering comes into your life.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.920]   Because you decided to follow Jesus, and because you decided to accept this love of God, that
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.280]   suffering began to come into your life.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.880]   That's exactly what he's saying.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   You and I, we reject the health and wealth gospel.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.160]   We have a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.280]   If it's health and wealth, you know, the prosperity gospel, if you believe in Jesus Christ, you're
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.800]   going to be healthy, wealthy.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   We don't believe in that.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.400]   At least, I don't think we do.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   We don't preach that.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.000]   You know, if we were to ask you to survey, I don't think you would be at this church.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.520]   But there's a knee-jerk reaction in our lives when something good happens, we automatically
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.440]   say, "That must be from God."
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.360]   Get a good job, make money, maybe win the lottery.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.680]   Maybe we're able to get the house that you wanted.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.760]   God really blessed my life.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.000]   And then when something difficult happens, you feel under pressure, you didn't get the
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.840]   job you wanted.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.440]   You went to the hospital and found out that you were sick.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   Your relationships are falling apart.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   Somebody betrayed you.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.080]   We automatically, there's a knee-jerk reaction, "Did I do something wrong?
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.320]   Why has God forsaken me?"
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.200]   Even though we don't accept the health and wealth gospel, the health and wealth, the
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:06.240]   prosperity gospel is so deeply embedded in the psyche of every human being that it clouds
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.360]   the way that we see life in everything that we do.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.320]   And that's the complaint of this psalmist.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.680]   I've done everything good.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.400]   So in other words, what he's saying is, "I expected only good things to happen.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.040]   I expected that you would answer my prayers and I would get the job and my family would
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.200]   come together and everything would turn out well.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   But what happened?"
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   See, he says, "For your sake, because we've been faithful to you, we are being poured
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   out like sheep.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.040]   We are like sheep to be slaughtered."
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.680]   See, the idea of sheep being slaughtered at this period of time, I mean, immediately you
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.960]   had an image of sacrifice because the most common animal that was sacrificed at the temple
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.520]   was the lamb.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.160]   A sheep being slaughtered automatically was equated with sacrifice, with atonement, with
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.520]   worship at the temple.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.720]   So in other words, the psalmist is saying, "We're being poured out as an offering to
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   you.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   Why is this happening?
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.400]   Why are we suffering?"
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.760]   Yet the scripture describes Jesus himself in the exact same way.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.920]   In Isaiah 53, 7, he says, "He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.480]   mouth like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that before its shearer's
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.520]   assignment, so he opened not his mouth."
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.840]   It shouldn't surprise any of us because Jesus made it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   If you want to be my disciple, take up your cross and follow me.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.560]   Jesus went to the cross, was offered as a sacrifice as a lamb.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:55.080]   So it shouldn't surprise us that our lives are also a sacrifice like the lamb.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.640]   It is not despite the fact that we follow Christ that suffering comes.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.320]   It is because.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.480]   Because we have been delivered from the kingdom of darkness into the glorious kingdom of his
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.640]   son.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.840]   We no longer belong in this world.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.280]   We are aliens and strangers in enemy territory.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.700]   And the fact that suffering comes because we are followers of Christ is only assurance
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.200]   that we are following Christ.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.480]   In fact, doesn't Jesus warn us, "Be careful when every man says good things of you.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.200]   They did not receive me and they will not receive you."
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.360]   So the fact that everybody is saying good things of you, the righteous and the unrighteous,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.960]   may be evidence that you are not following me.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.480]   It completely changes our perspective on suffering.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.880]   In fact, in Acts chapter 5, 40-41, you have these same apostles.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.720]   It's just a few chapters before when Jesus was going to the cross, were cowarding, were
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.400]   afraid.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:07.200]   Just when their master was going to the cross, I mean, his disciples, his apostles are hiding
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.720]   because they're afraid of suffering.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.760]   They're afraid of their punishment.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   They're afraid of pain.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:17.480]   So even Peter, the leader among the disciples, would deny Jesus to his face three times.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.960]   And yet, just a few chapters later, just about a month or so later, we see them after being
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.480]   caught in front of the same people who crucified Jesus.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.840]   They beat them and forbid them to continue to talk about Jesus.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:39.040]   And their response, verse 41, "Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.140]   they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name."
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.320]   What changed?
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.060]   What made these men who were so afraid just a month before, stand up with such courage
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.060]   and willing to die?
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.960]   In fact, they considered it a privilege, an honor to suffer for the name of Christ.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.200]   What happened during that time?
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.080]   Now, you and I know what that is.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.560]   Jesus died and then he was resurrected.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.700]   That even in death, Jesus was sovereign.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.760]   Even in death.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.960]   And the Holy Spirit comes upon them and all of a sudden, these men absolutely change.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:25.040]   Their perspective of suffering and pain change, absolutely change because of the resurrection.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.400]   In 2 Corinthians 12, 10, it says, "For the sake of Christ, and I am content with weakness,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.320]   insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities."
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.600]   It's not because Paul enjoyed being weak.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.720]   It's not because Paul somehow was one of those special men who enjoyed being insulted and
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.920]   experiencing hardships.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.840]   In fact, before Paul met Christ, he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.920]   He was raised as a Roman citizen.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.440]   He was wealthy.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.920]   His father purchased an opportunity for him to be discipled by the greatest scholar of
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.320]   that time, Gamaliel.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.380]   This guy was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:14.600]   And yet, because he met Christ, he experienced the suffering, hardship, insults, persecution.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.440]   And he says, "I rejoice for all these things because for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.120]   It is not because he innately loved these things.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.040]   Nobody turns the other cheek because that's just who they are.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.520]   You get slapped on the cheek and like, "Hit me on this side."
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   Right?
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.520]   It's just, that's just who I am.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.000]   Nobody is like that.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.080]   Our natural desire, we run away from danger.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   We want to live.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.280]   If we have a choice between safety and hardship, of course we're going to chase after safety.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:52.640]   What Paul is saying though, is that God brings these things in our lives to deliberately
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.400]   make us weak.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.520]   We, our natural nature is to become strong.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.600]   We want to be intelligent.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.720]   We want to be educated.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.400]   We want to have more money so that we can have more influence.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.480]   Our natural inclination is to be strong.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.200]   But God's inclination toward us is to make us weak.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.920]   So that we could be recognized as weak.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.720]   Because Paul says it isn't until we are weak that He is strong.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:28.960]   If you are confident in your finances, that's the area where you probably stumble the most.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.360]   That's the area that you probably have the hardest time trusting God the most.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.800]   Because you're good at it.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.160]   Maybe you're more intelligent.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.400]   Maybe you're better at taking tests.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.960]   Maybe you went to the upper echelon of schools.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   And it's the very things, those very things are the things that are causing you to stumble.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.200]   Because when you are strong, you are weak.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.340]   God deliberately brings suffering in our lives to make us weak.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.680]   Because that's when He is strong.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.360]   Isn't that what sanctification is?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.560]   Isn't sanctification a process of making Christ bigger in our lives?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.280]   Isn't sanctification ultimately to have the aroma of Christ stronger in all that we are?
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:21.320]   So God's purpose in our life is exactly the opposite of what we naturally pursue in this
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.440]   physical life.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.080]   So He allows suffering, hardship, persecution to make us weak.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.400]   Because it is in our weakness that He is strong.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   Philippians 1 29 30, "For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.920]   not only believe in Him, but also suffer for Him."
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.360]   It's been granted.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.280]   Suffering for a Christian is never meaningless.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.360]   Is never meaningless.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.760]   Suffering without meaning, when pain comes into your life and you don't know why, that's
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.560]   what makes it hard.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.000]   But you know when the pain is good.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.600]   Because you're following Christ and there's purpose and meaning behind it that causes
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.200]   us to long for Him.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.600]   When Christ becomes strong because of our suffering, it completely changes the way that
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.980]   we view and interact with suffering in our lives.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.200]   Hardship was not experienced by Apostle Paul despite the fact that God is sovereign and
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   loving.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.320]   It is because God is sovereign and loving, He was suffering.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:30.280]   Secondly, not only does it change our perspective, not only because of the love that we experience
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.960]   suffering, He says we are more than conquerors because of His love, through His love.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.840]   In verse 37, "In all these things, in all these trials, we are more than conquerors
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.360]   through Him who loved us."
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.560]   In the ESV it just says more than conquerors.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:52.600]   NASB, it makes sure that we understand that Paul in essence is taking us to the superlative.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.040]   He's not just saying, "Oh you're going to conquer."
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.840]   He said we're above and beyond that.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   So in the NASB it says, "In all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320]   loves us."
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   Overwhelmingly.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.520]   And that's the idea in the Greek.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.360]   That in contrast to what the world thinks, that in the midst of suffering, it's like,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   "Wow, you're being targeted.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.960]   Your life must be hard.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.720]   You know, what's going on?
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.740]   How come your God doesn't love you?"
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:26.320]   And they may be accusing these things of Christians, yet what he's saying is they do not know.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   Not only are we not beaten, not only are we not in despair, he says, "No, we are more
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.320]   than conquerors."
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.940]   We are more than conquerors.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:42.040]   In 2 Corinthians 4, 7-12 it says, "But we have these treasures in jars of clay."
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   Treasures in jars of clay.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.000]   Jars of clay basically is a way of saying that on the surface it looks worthless.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   A jar of clay is something that the world would pick up and have no value.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.080]   They wouldn't put it in the vault.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.800]   They wouldn't put anything valuable in this jar.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.720]   It's just made out of clay.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.360]   But he says our treasures are in jars of clay.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   It may not look like anything.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.320]   It may look like trash and useless to the world, but they're his treasure.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.120]   To show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.680]   It is not the packaging, but the gift itself.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   Right?
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   And I think I mentioned this before.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.520]   When you're kind of embarrassed about the gift, you do a great job packaging.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   Right?
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.200]   But when you have this fantastic gift, you almost kind of want them to be disappointed.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   Right?
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.360]   You put it in a plastic bag and you tape it up and it looks like you just kind of scrunched
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360]   it together.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   And what is in there?
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   They open it and diamond ring.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   Right?
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.960]   So, a lot of guys when they propose, they put it in food or bun cake or something and
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.240]   it's like, "What is this?"
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   And then they're like, "Oh."
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   Right?
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.760]   He said, "Our treasures are in jars of clay."
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.560]   Even though on the surface it may look like affliction and hardship and difficulty, it's
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.320]   because they do not see the Christ, our sovereign God, who loves us behind all of that.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   We are afflicted.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   And the word afflicted basically means to be under pressure.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.840]   Right?
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.560]   We're constantly under pressure.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.360]   Under pressure from the world.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.800]   Under pressure from relationships.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   Under pressure because of uncertainty.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.160]   He says, "We are afflicted but not crushed."
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.400]   You're under pressure but you will never be crushed.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.280]   God will not allow it.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.000]   He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are capable.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.240]   Because He's in control.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.960]   Perplexed but not driven to despair.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.160]   The word perplexed means confused or even literally to doubt.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.120]   You know, in the Christian world, we're not allowed to doubt.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   Right?
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.120]   We're not allowed to doubt.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:59.200]   So we can talk about struggling and difficulty and all this stuff but we're not saying, "Oh,
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   I don't know.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.960]   You know, sometimes I doubt."
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   So, "Ooooh!"
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   You said that.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.840]   You said the doubt.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.320]   But the reality is, whether it is allowed or not allowed, isn't that the experience
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   of every Christian?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.720]   There are periods in your life where there is serious doubt.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.280]   There are periods in your life where you question, "Why is God doing this?
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.120]   I don't understand."
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   And when it gets bad enough, you question His love.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.720]   I mean, isn't that the reality?
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.240]   You know, what I love about the Bible is the Bible doesn't dress any of this up.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.320]   The Bible just presents it as it is.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.200]   If you've ever read through the book of Psalms, a big chunk of the book of Psalms is crying
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.120]   out to God like, "Where are you?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.840]   Why do you let the wicked prosper?
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.960]   And the righteous suffer?
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.280]   I don't get you.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.600]   What are you doing?"
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:05.720]   The whole book of Job is trying to figure out, "What is God doing?"
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:13.000]   But Jesus said, "Even if you have faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains."
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.200]   And it's not because it's the power of faith.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:23.640]   It's that even that tiny connection to the super powerful God, even that tiny connection,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   that faith that connects us to this living God is enough to move mountains.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.680]   And sometimes you and I have to be honest and confess that that's what's holding us
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   up.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.000]   That's what's connecting us to God.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.400]   There are periods in our life where we don't understand what's going on, why God is allowing
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.760]   these things to happen in your life, and it is that small faith that God planted in you
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.480]   that you're holding on to.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.960]   And that's why we, she says, we are perplexed.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   We don't understand.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:00.480]   And at times we doubt, but we are never led to despair.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.600]   Because that tiny little faith still gives us hope.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:13.420]   We are persecuted, targeted for harm, but never forsaken.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.080]   Never forsaken.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.680]   We are struck down, but not destroyed.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.120]   I don't know about you, when you think about struck down, what images come into your mind,
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   right?
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.240]   If you watch MMA, you might be thinking, "Wow, that guy got struck down."
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   Beaten hard.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.400]   You get hit so hard, you get put to the ground.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.200]   When I think of struck down, I think about the ultimate striking down is death.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.240]   And I think that that's what Paul is talking about.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.320]   That even in death, you are never completely destroyed.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.280]   The worst possible scenario in the secular world, the greatest fear in the world, before
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.880]   we met Christ, is, "What if this happens and we die?"
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   That's the greatest fear.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   That's the greatest tragedy.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:04.240]   But he says, "Even in death, we are not destroyed."
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.000]   It completely changes.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.760]   We are not only, is it purposeful, but we conquer.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:17.000]   2 Corinthians 4, 16-18, "So we do not lose heart, though our outer nature is wasted away,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.640]   our inner nature is being renewed day by day.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.960]   comparison."
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.640]   Think that in the context of Paul and his ministry.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.440]   Slight momentary affliction.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.200]   He's not talking about stubbing his toe.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.500]   He's not talking about a paper cut.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:43.240]   This is a man who was stoned, thought to be dead, dragged out into the city, and came
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.020]   back in, preached the gospel.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.640]   He was whipped to the point of death.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   Several times.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   He was shipwrecked.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.000]   Bitten by scorpions.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Going hungry.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.880]   He was a countryman, preaching the gospel just to make it hard for him.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.360]   Even this very church that he's writing this letter to, that he poured his life out, he
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.920]   was burned out coming into this city.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.400]   But by the encouragement of Jesus, he said, "Go continue to preach.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.000]   I have many people in this city."
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.800]   And despite that, he continued to preach, and he plants this church.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.640]   And this very church, this very church that he spent the second most amount of time in,
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.120]   the first being Ephesus, second in Corinth, starts to question, like, "Is that guy an
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120]   apostle?"
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.320]   Think about the heartache and brokenness in him, having to convince these very people
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.480]   that he risked his life to get the gospel to him, questioning his apostleship.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.760]   I mean, we're not talking about physically, emotionally, spiritually.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:45.120]   In every way, here's a man who should have quit.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.520]   And no one would be able to question him, because no one suffered like this man.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.460]   And yet, he says, "Slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.520]   beyond all comparison.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.600]   As we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen, for the
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:10.000]   things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.640]   Even in the midst of suffering, he said, "We are conquerors, because our Almighty loving
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.560]   God is with us."
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:23.800]   Paul's suffering was directly linked to following Christ.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Directly linked to it.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.400]   That's why Paul says in 2 Timothy 2.10, "Therefore, I endure everything for the sake of the elect,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.600]   that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:40.520]   You know, you probably know this passage really well, 1 Corinthians 15.58, where Paul says
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.320]   to the Corinthians, "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.040]   abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.320]   Do you know why Paul writes that letter?
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.120]   Do you know why Paul writes that particular passage?
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:04.000]   He's not just thinking about, well, what do Christians need to hear?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.840]   He's writing this letter to a particular church, a group of people who are divided, fighting
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   against each other.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.120]   A church falling apart.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.220]   And he's writing this encouragement because there's temptation to quit.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.600]   He says, "Be steadfast," because some of them are being tempted not to be steadfast.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.120]   They're tired and they're burned out.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.160]   "Be immovable," because some of them are being tempted to move.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.600]   I've had enough of this.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.120]   Maybe I'll move to Philippi.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.960]   "Be immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord."
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:50.600]   He says this because there's people probably in the church ready to quit, like many others
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:58.320]   actually have, knowing that your labor is never in vain.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   That no matter what suffering, no matter what hardship comes into your life, our sovereign
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.840]   God is in control.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.520]   "Therefore, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.120]   that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.480]   See, suffering as a Christian, when you know that a sovereign God is behind all of this,
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.040]   it completely changes the way we see suffering, the way we relate to suffering.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.520]   But finally, third and the most powerful statement of all the statements is found in the last
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.920]   part in verse 37 and 38, it says, "Nothing can separate us from the love of God."
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.360]   Nothing.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:43.400]   He started this passage, or at least this section, this idea, in Romans 8.28, it said,
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.120]   "For we know that all things work together for good, those who have been called according
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   to His purpose."
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   We know this.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.800]   And now he concludes in saying, "Not only do we know, I am convinced of this."
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.160]   So if you remember, he begins by saying, "The Holy Spirit has been given to us so that in
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.060]   the things that we do not know what to pray for, the Holy Spirit comes and He intercedes
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.060]   on our behalf."
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.060]   Because there's things that you don't know.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.960]   But one thing that I do know, that my sovereign God is in control of all things.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.560]   That all of these things are going to work together for good for those who have been
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.120]   called according to His purpose.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.840]   And then the crescendo, the final punch is, "I am now convinced, convicted, I am assured
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:28.720]   that the love of Christ will never be separated from me."
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:35.240]   Even the most timid of ladies, when they have a child, become fierce.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.680]   Everybody, this is just natural observation, right?
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:47.160]   Even the meekest of creatures, even the tenderest of women, do not mess with their kids.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.400]   They'll kill you.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.040]   This is just a known fact.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:30:00.080]   Whether it is a puppy or a chicken or a dove or a snake, whatever it is, you don't mess
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   with their pup.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.440]   We all know this.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.840]   God uses this as an illustration to remind us of His love.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.280]   In Isaiah 49, 15, it says, "Can a woman forget her nursing child?"
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.600]   Now obviously that's a rhetorical question.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   Of course not.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.960]   You know that you cannot.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.200]   That she should have no compassion in the sun of her womb?
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.220]   Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.680]   Even though there's every intent to watch our children, to care for them, that every
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.120]   mother instinctively will give their life for the safety of their child.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.680]   But even if that fails, He says, "I will not."
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.080]   Nothing will separate us from the love of God.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.360]   You know what's amazing about that verse in Isaiah 49, verse 16?
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:31:00.120]   He concludes it by saying, "Behold, here's evidence that my love will not fail you.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.520]   Behold, I have engraved you in the palm of my hands."
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:11.120]   Now if you read the commentators, they have different ideas of what this means.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:17.920]   The consensus though is that in the ancient Near East culture, that in order to not to
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.760]   forget something, that they sometimes would make marks on their palms.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.880]   It's kind of like a long time ago when you wanted to not forget something, you would
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   write it on their palms.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.160]   I don't think people do that today.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   You just take a picture.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   Right?
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.400]   If you don't want to forget the number or something, you just take a picture and you
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.760]   go home and you bring it back up.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.840]   But before all of that, we would just write it on our hands.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   Right?
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   Here's my number.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   Boom.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   You write it.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   Or there's a test coming up.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   Or here's an important date.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.040]   Or even if you forgot, you would just kind of, you know, if you put it on the back of
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.140]   your head, you wouldn't see it, but it's on your hand, so you're going to see it.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   And that's what he's saying.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:00.780]   This culture where he says, "I will not forget you because I have engraved you on
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   my hands."
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:07.800]   Now, I don't like to milk passages and say, "Oh, here's Jesus."
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.400]   You know?
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.080]   But I can't help but to imagine, and I think you're probably thinking the same thing, when
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.000]   Jesus, when God says, "I will not forget you.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.520]   I have engraved you in my hands."
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:24.240]   What image does that automatically conjure up in your head?
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.040]   Scars of Christ.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:35.640]   When Jesus was resurrected and Thomas wanted to be assured, Jesus showed him his scars.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:41.560]   Jesus' glorified body is a permanent body that he has for eternity.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.960]   And that glorified body had scars.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:52.260]   So which means today, Jesus has those scars on his hands.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.760]   Even if the greatest love that we know in this world, the love of a mother toward their
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:04.080]   child, even if that fails, "My love will not fail you because I have engraved you
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   in my hands."
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.760]   What is that scar reminding him of constantly?
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:26.600]   "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son."
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:38.680]   I know we recite that verse probably a thousand times, a hundred thousand times.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:45.400]   But if you really believe that, it's not just a theological statement of the church.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.480]   It is not just the core of the gospel.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:56.320]   But it's the God of the universe who's willing to give his only begotten son.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.840]   Think of your sins.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.040]   Think of the darkness in your heart.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.800]   Think of how often you doubt him.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.940]   Think of the hatred that you harbor in your heart toward people.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:18.600]   Think of the lust that you compromise every single week.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:32.440]   And yet, he chose to pursue us.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.200]   He chose to love us.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.560]   Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:35:06.440]   Not death, not life, not angels, not rulers, not present, not things to come, not powers,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:14.920]   not height, not depth, nothing.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:27.120]   Despite our sins, how can we not be changed?
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.900]   This is why we have confidence.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.280]   This is why we have confidence.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.000]   Consider how fickle our hearts are.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.680]   The weather changes, our mood changes.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:47.160]   Somebody says something to you and ruins our day.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:54.960]   How many times have we determined to honor God and have failed the very next day?
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:01.240]   If our security was based upon you, just like our New Year's resolution, we would be done
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.280]   by February.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.440]   And then we are lost in March.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:14.960]   No, our salvation is not based on your will or your good.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.240]   God had mercy on us.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.320]   And he demonstrates his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.760]   for us.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.600]   That's why we will never be separated from his love.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   And with that confidence, live up to the calling that you have received.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.000]   Let's pray.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
