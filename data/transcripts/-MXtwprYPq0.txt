[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - APJ listeners, hello.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.140]   Welcome to this special episode,
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.220]   an update from Pastor John's life and ministry,
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.640]   and a little summary of all our labors
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.680]   at DesiringGod.org.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.880]   As some of you know, our ministry year runs
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.160]   July 1st to June 30th.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.600]   So we close out fiscal year 2020
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.980]   and enter into fiscal year 2021 in just a few days.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.280]   And of course, we are fully supported by God's people.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.140]   Listeners like you.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.240]   So this episode is also a big thank you
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.660]   to all of our partners,
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.560]   and we'd love for more of you to join us.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.100]   And I'll explain how in just a little bit.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.500]   It's been an incredible year for this podcast
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.800]   as we near episode 1500.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.940]   That's unreal to me.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.460]   That episode, episode 1500 should drop in mid-July.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.140]   And when it does, we will take some time
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.600]   to talk more about APJ and to explore
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.560]   some of the productivity takeaways
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.260]   of Pastor John's ministry
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.780]   as we approach the eighth anniversary
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.740]   of Ask Pastor John.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.620]   Wow.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.580]   More broadly, when you look at all the resources
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.340]   at DesiringGod.org, the books, the articles,
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.920]   the podcasts, the look at the book videos,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.280]   when you combine the reach of them all,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.900]   we've seen about 200 million resource views
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.980]   across all of our platforms this fiscal year.
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.540]   Those numbers are staggering as well.
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.800]   And of course, most recently,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.220]   the Coronavirus and Christ book has seen
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.260]   over a million downloads globally
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260]   and is being made freely available
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.860]   in almost 30 different languages now.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.100]   It's been a crazy spring for everyone,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.580]   but here in this transition as we close off one year
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.340]   and look ahead to the next year ahead,
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520]   I wanted to take a moment to ask you, Pastor John,
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.340]   about our past year.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.460]   But first, I would love a personal update.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.060]   What has life been like for you during this pandemic
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.280]   and now, especially with the protests
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.020]   and the riots happening just within blocks
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.500]   of your home in Minneapolis?
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.340]   Right.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.260]   Well, the most important thing to say
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.860]   about what has happened here in Minneapolis
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400]   in the last week, and I know this is being played
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.380]   a couple of weeks later than we're recording it,
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.560]   in the last week, that is about a week
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.180]   since the death of George Floyd,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.660]   the most important thing to say, I believe,
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.540]   is that the authority and holiness of God
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.460]   was defied by a policeman who put his knee
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.180]   on a man's neck for seven minutes until he died,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.100]   ignoring all legitimate pleas
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.700]   that he was sufficiently subdued and dying.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   That's the main reality of this moment here in Minneapolis.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.220]   And of course, the burning and the looting
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.400]   of hundreds of businesses about a mile from my house,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.860]   down on Lake Street, is also defiance
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.620]   against the authority and the holiness of God.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.860]   And as I've been pondering these things,
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.900]   my thoughts about the wars on the streets
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.240]   and the hundreds of fires and the looting
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.860]   and the coronavirus, what presses in on me
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.160]   is that there's a war beneath the wars
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.740]   and there's a looting beneath the looting
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.060]   and there's a virus beneath the virus.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.220]   Everything is deeper.
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.740]   Nothing is merely what you see.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.500]   James asks, "What causes wars and fightings among you?
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   Is it not that your passions are at war within you?
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.740]   You desire and do not have, so you murder."
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.740]   In other words, beneath the wars of knees on necks
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.740]   and wars of reprisal in the war of looting,
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.400]   there's a war of soul going on with murderous effects
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.840]   of unsatisfied desires, James 4.1.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.760]   And underneath the looting, there's another looting,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.840]   the looting of heaven.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.680]   We have stolen God's honor, robbed him of glory
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.000]   10,000 times.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.240]   And beneath the coronavirus is an unfathomably,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.980]   oh, have I been impressed with the power of sin,
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.980]   unfathomable power and deadly virus of God belittling sin.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.480]   It is absolutely resistant to every cure,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.440]   but the blood of Jesus.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.740]   So that's where my mind has been, Tony, in these days,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.540]   the war beneath the war, the looting beneath the looting,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.800]   the virus beneath the virus.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.660]   And what is our calling?
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.560]   What is the calling of desiring God?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   You might say that the coronavirus has created
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.540]   the kind of solitude for me,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.260]   and the street wars have created the kind of urgency
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.260]   in my mind and heart that blows away the fog
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.140]   of worldliness and confusion,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.380]   and brings a good deal of clarity to what life is really for,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.380]   even 74-year-old John Piper life.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.800]   You know, we've had to cancel all our travels
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.300]   in recent months and indefinitely into the future,
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.640]   and turn all our regular meetings into Zoom meetings.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.520]   But this has been very clarifying for me
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.880]   because it has confirmed something God was doing,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   a stirring in my own heart that focusing on the study
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.540]   and the teaching of God's word through,
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.300]   look at the book at desiring God,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.140]   through look at the book should be a higher priority for me
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.940]   in these next years, if God gives me years,
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.380]   than travel should.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.980]   Look at the book feels to me increasingly
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.640]   like the kind of legacy that I want to leave,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.520]   namely, look, look with me, world, look,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.480]   look at God's word with me.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   Come, let's walk together among the riches of Ephesians.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.880]   Nothing in these days of police brutality
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.480]   and rioting and coronavirus is more important
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.140]   than actually seeing the reality of God in Christ,
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.960]   in his word and submitting to it in all of its detail
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.080]   and its radical, radical difference
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.560]   from the pathways of sin.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.980]   So every minute that I am granted
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.320]   by the limitations put on me now by coronavirus,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.020]   every minute that I'm granted
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.760]   that I wouldn't have been granted,
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.480]   I'm pressing in on a life goal
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.160]   of opening all of Paul's letters with look at the book.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.480]   - Amazing, multi-year project ahead.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.880]   - Right, it could be, I mean, realistically,
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.080]   unless I do nothing else, like 50 hours a week,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.720]   it's probably a 10-year project,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.540]   but that puts me at 84,
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.560]   whether I'll be functioning at 84, God knows.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.680]   - Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.040]   And we're talking about look at the book,
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.680]   your video series of you drawing on the text,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.280]   I'm sure a lot of listeners are familiar with.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.800]   Give us some reflections on the coronavirus book now.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.120]   It's been translated all over the world.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.320]   What are your takeaways as you look back now
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   on that book project
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.040]   and any lessons that you're taking away from that?
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.960]   - The emergence of the coronavirus in Christ book
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.080]   are really stunning as I look back on them.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.840]   They're almost like a dream, how that happened.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   I mean, you were there,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.780]   we were in a leadership team meeting
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.160]   and praying, thinking, should we say anything?
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.480]   Should we do anything?
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.760]   Should we create a website?
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   Should we, what should we do?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.400]   And somebody, I think it was Scott said,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.800]   maybe you should tweak your hospital book,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   you know, how to not waste your suffering,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.240]   how to not waste your hospital stay, tweak that
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.480]   and how to not waste your coronavirus or something.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.880]   So I went home and started to write
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.560]   and 100 pages later, it was not a tweak.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.160]   It was not a tweak anymore.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.400]   It was a burden that just fell out of my heart.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.160]   It took four days to write that book.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.680]   And then the team just jumped on it right away,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.960]   edited it within 24 hours.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.360]   Crossway, bless their hearts,
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.560]   almost dropped everything,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   turned it into a book,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.960]   turned it around in a matter of days.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.360]   And the heart of Crossway with us is so wonderful
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   because they're so ready with us to say,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.760]   okay, let's give away the electronic copy.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.680]   Let's give away the audio book.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.560]   I'd never recorded a book before
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.440]   and somebody, I forget who suggested that.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.280]   Let's do that.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.520]   So you and I, you know,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.400]   with our electronic possibilities here,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.320]   we recorded the book.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.520]   And so the book is free in recording,
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.160]   the book is free in electronic
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.960]   and then you can buy a hard copy.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.280]   And then Rick Denham, our partner
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.120]   in international relations jumps on it
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.400]   and what, we've got close to 30 translators
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.720]   recruited from all over the world
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.040]   to turn the translation around in a matter of weeks.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.600]   And I think we're pushing 30, not quite,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.800]   but all of that was absolutely stunning to me.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.520]   And my prayer for the book,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.160]   if somebody were to say, what's it about?
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.120]   What are you trying to do with that book?
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.280]   I would say my goal is for the church
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.720]   and the world in reading the book
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   to be brought to a fresh or maybe a first time repentance,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.160]   meaning the reordering.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.200]   When I say repentance,
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.640]   I don't mainly feel bad about what you've done in the past.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.880]   That's part of it.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.240]   It's not the main part though.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.920]   Repentance, metanoia is a mind that gets turned around
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.640]   like 180 degrees from belittling or ignoring
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.280]   or neglecting Jesus.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.000]   And now bringing all of your thinking,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.720]   all of your feeling, all of your acting
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.160]   into alignment with the infinite value of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.240]   And a key text there would be Philippians 3,8
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.120]   where Paul says, I count everything as loss
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.760]   because of the infinite value of knowing Jesus.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.360]   And so I just think one of the effects of threats
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   to our life and our world should be Jesus.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   They're really precious, really, really precious.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.200]   - That's good.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.240]   Props to Scottie Anderson for igniting that book project
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.320]   that launched what became an all hands on deck DG project
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.160]   with Crossway.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.000]   It was amazing.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.480]   Speaking of books, we're recording this episode early
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.360]   because you've got to get off to vacation
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.760]   and then off to book writing
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.160]   because the summer months are when you normally write
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.980]   your big books, your new big books,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.080]   and you're planning to do so again this summer.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.920]   Can you give us a preview of what's on your mind
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.760]   and your heart?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.600]   Like what's gonna be the next book project for John Piper?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.420]   - Right.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.420]   For several years, I have longed to write a book,
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.000]   not a huge one, I hope a manageable one,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   but rigorous on the nature of saving faith.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.160]   And when I say nature of saving faith,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.600]   I don't mean anything too philosophical.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   I mean, what is it actually like in the soul,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.840]   in the mind, in the affections?
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   What is it like to have or exercise saving faith?
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.360]   Specifically, I'm a Christian hedonist.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   I want to know more precisely and express helpfully
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.040]   for others how the affectional dimension of our lives
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.120]   relates to this act of faith.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.840]   For example, what's the relationship
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   between trusting God and loving God?
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.180]   And a key text there is gonna be 1 John 5, 2-5,
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.400]   where John is just amazing in the way he relates
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.480]   love for God and faith in God.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.020]   You know, I've always, goodness,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.080]   ever since I wrote "Faith in Future Grace,"
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   I've always defined saving faith as being satisfied
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.040]   with all that God is for you in Jesus.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.460]   Now that's a pretty controversial definition
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.060]   because it foregrounds the affectional dimension
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.480]   of our hearts called being satisfied.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.920]   And I based that on John 6, 35.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.480]   And what I'm gonna do in this book is test that.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.240]   I'm gonna do a more thoroughgoing, rigorous,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.000]   across the Bible and mainly New Testament effort
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.960]   to ask, "Okay, Piper, you've been talking that way
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.240]   for a long time.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.680]   You got any other verses?
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.960]   Like, is this your weird, eccentric way
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.360]   of talking about saving faith?
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   Or does the Bible as a whole really warrant that?"
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.400]   Another way to say it would be,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   when you read John 1, 11 and 12,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   he came to his own, Jesus came to his own,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.640]   and his own people did not receive him,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.080]   but to all who did receive him,
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.180]   comma, who believed in his name, comma.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.020]   So you can see how receiving and believing
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.960]   are being treated as a parallel there
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.660]   and explaining each other.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.680]   To all who did receive him, who believed in his name,
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.800]   he gave the right to become the children of God.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.060]   Now, my question is, receive him as what?
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.600]   Receive him how?
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.880]   If you receive him as savior,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.220]   what is that soul experience like?
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.100]   If you receive him as Lord,
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.880]   what is that soul experience like?
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.560]   If you receive him as treasure,
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.400]   what is that soul experience like?
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.240]   And you can see right off the bat
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.760]   that the word receive there,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.480]   which is right at the heart of the essence
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.600]   of what faith is, is not obvious
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.820]   when it relates to different objects
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.720]   or Christ viewed through different lenses
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.080]   as savior or Lord or treasure or other ways.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.800]   So that's the gist of what I'm after in the book.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.000]   And I would love for people to pray for me.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.800]   That'll be what, when is that gonna happen?
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.600]   July, July or August?
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.640]   I think we set aside about seven or eight weeks
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.720]   to work on that.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.700]   So pray that I could get it done
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.080]   and that it would of course be
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.000]   as faithful to scripture as possible.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.840]   - A big task ahead.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.720]   We'll be praying for you obviously as DG team
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.320]   and absolutely APJ listeners,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.100]   we would love for you to chime in and to pray.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.960]   And let's not forget,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.880]   you have a big book on Providence
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.460]   that's coming out in January.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.960]   Any thoughts on that as you look forward to that launch?
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.680]   That's a pretty significant project.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.000]   - I have in my left hand at this very moment,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.040]   the color comps as they call them for the book
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.360]   and asking me, how do you like this color for the cover?
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.320]   And so crossway, they're so gracious to work with us
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   at Desiring God to take our sense of things into account.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.360]   So that's where we are.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.720]   The layout of the book, the type setting
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.800]   and the copy editing are going on right now.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.920]   We're pretty far along.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   It will be in its fixed form within a matter of weeks.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.640]   Probably, it's a very big book.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.280]   It's a book I have dreamed of writing
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.640]   and finished last summer.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.360]   It's a book that I had hoped I could write for years
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.880]   and God finally gave me the two summers in a row
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.080]   to devote to writing it.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.120]   In a sense, I would say it's the foundation
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.760]   and the sum of all I have ever taught.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.080]   It seeks to be biblical throughout
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.100]   rather than mainly philosophical,
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.440]   which I think sets it off
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.560]   from good many other books on Providence.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.120]   It addresses the goal of Providence,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.800]   the nature of Providence, the extent of Providence.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.000]   And if people wonder, what do you mean?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.840]   What's the difference?
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.560]   Why didn't you call it the sovereignty book
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.920]   instead of the Providence book?
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.360]   And the answer is that sovereignty, in my understanding,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.080]   is the right and the power of God to do all he pleases,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.280]   but Providence is purposeful sovereignty.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   Providence brings into the observation and the discussion,
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.000]   why is he doing what he's doing?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   If in fact he governs the fall of every sparrow in the world,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.560]   my wife loves to do bird watching
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.880]   and put up feeders outside.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.840]   And we watch these sparrows and wrens by the truckload
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.320]   and she tries to get rid of them
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.120]   to get a bird of color here, you know,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.620]   something blue and red and yellow.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.460]   But every one of those,
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.800]   there's a bazillion of them all over the world
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.760]   and not one of them, Jesus says,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.600]   falls to the ground apart from our father.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.160]   If that's true, what's he doing?
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.640]   What's God doing?
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.800]   If he decides that a bird drops down
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.600]   in some dark jungle today in Papua New Guinea
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.640]   and it falls to the ground, what was the point of that?
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.760]   There is a point.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.360]   God never acts whimsically, ever.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.400]   He does what he does for all wise reasons.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.760]   And so Providence poses that question.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.640]   In a sense, this book will provide the biggest,
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.240]   most extensive rationale for the existence of desiring God.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.080]   Because desiring God and I exist
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.560]   to make the truth plain and powerful
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.120]   that God is most glorified in us
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.660]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.400]   If you say, where is the world,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.040]   where is the universe going in the exercise
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.920]   of all God's sovereign providences?
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.240]   The answer is he's going to be glorified
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   in his bride's satisfaction in him.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.560]   - That's the conclusion, I love it.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.700]   It's a great book, I've read it,
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.760]   but I can't wait to hold it in my hands.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.680]   Thank you, Pastor John, for all of those updates.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.840]   - Thank you, my pleasure.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.880]   Appreciate your partnership
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.160]   and everybody's partnership out there
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.600]   that makes possible what we do here.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.720]   We love our work and we love those who make it possible.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.120]   - Amen, we sure do.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.320]   And that is no overstatement.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   All the strategic book projects, this podcast,
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.800]   everything we do at DesiringGod.org,
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.640]   all of it exists because we have generous ministry partners
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.760]   who pray for us regularly and who pitch in to donate
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   to fund all of our labors.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.940]   We especially feel your support in seasons like this one
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.440]   when the ministry opportunities and the spiritual needs
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.800]   seem particularly huge and demanding.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.440]   We've been able to meet some of these needs
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.640]   because we have you at our side,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.300]   even during a global pandemic
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.160]   and even through national social upheaval,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.640]   when the time is right to spend more money than normal
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.520]   on gospel mission.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.640]   If you are already a ministry partner with us,
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.720]   we love you and we thank God for you.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.120]   Thank you for your prayers
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.600]   and for helping to make this past year possible
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.000]   and the year ahead possible as well.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.800]   And we would love for more of you to join us in this work.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.880]   You can join us, say monthly, for as little as $10 a month,
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.720]   and that would help make it possible for us
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.020]   to continue our labors and to expand our ministry outreach
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.520]   into the new ministry year, which again begins July 1st.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.400]   Well, what does the Lord have in store for us
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.240]   in the year ahead?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.600]   I'm almost afraid to ask, to be honest,
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.420]   but I'm sure there will be a lot more work to be done.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.580]   You will be with us, and most important of all,
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.640]   God's presence will be with us for whatever is ahead.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.160]   To join us and to make a gift today,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.800]   visit DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.340]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.920]   As always, I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.880]   Thank you for partnering with us.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.080]   We'll see you next time.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
