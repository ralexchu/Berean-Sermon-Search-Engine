[00:11:40.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.180]   I'd like to begin by reading Psalm 86, verses 11.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.180]   And it reads, "Teach me your way, O Lord,
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.980]   that I may walk in your truth,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.980]   unite my heart to your name."
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.560]   We may be surrounded by many distractions and temptations,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.900]   and I pray it would be our desire and prayer
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.560]   to have an undivided heart to the Lord
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.680]   and a devotion to Him alone.

[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:59.560]   - Okay, good morning, everyone.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   We have four announcements.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   First one, our Bible Lab, if you signed up for it already,
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   will be beginning today at 2 p.m.,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   meeting upstairs in the Sprouts Room with Pastor Mark,
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   so get as prompt as you can.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   Secondly, the Intentional Sisters Fellowship
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   is also beginning.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   That sign-up is closing today,
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   so it's not beginning anytime really soon,
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   but today the sign-up's closed,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   so you do have to kind of make a decision,
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   and all the information is up there in your apps.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   Thirdly, BAM is going to be having a winter retreat,
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560]   and that's coming up fairly soon,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560]   so please sign up for that.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   And then next week, we'll be having Communion Sunday,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.560]   so you can prepare your hearts for worship,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.560]   specifically for communion before next week.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.560]   Okay, well, yesterday, our India team touched down back home,
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   and so we're really happy to see them.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   They're kind of roaming around,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   but we're going to be showing a video of their trip,
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   and then our brother Hubert's gonna be coming up
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   to give a testimony about that afterwards.

[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   Hi, my name is Hubert Kim.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   Thank you for this opportunity to share what I learned from this mission trip.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   Our team consisted of 16 members,
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   13 from Berean and 3 members from Cross Life Church.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.560]   We departed last Friday and after a total of 30 hours of travel,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   we arrived at our final destination in India.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   Over the next four days, we would visit a different village,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   and at each village, one member of our team would share their testimony
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   with the locals who were gathered there.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   And then we would split into three groups,
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   eye care, medical health screening, and BBS.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   I was so challenged by our team members,
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   even despite the long journey,
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   they served diligently with joy and with unity of purpose.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.560]   Pastor Sake, who's one of the main pastors there,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.560]   shared with us that these medical camps had great impact in several ways.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   Many Hindu people would not give any attention to Christianity,
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   but at the gathering, they're a captive audience
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   and they hear the testimony about Jesus.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   In addition, when they receive treatment,
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.560]   they're surprised that Christians would help Hindus,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   and they express their deep gratitude.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.560]   After these medical camps conclude,
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.560]   the local pastors then would gain more credibility with the local people
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.560]   and are more willing to meet with them.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.560]   I thought about the verse,
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news."
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   And I began to understand that the long hours of travel
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   coming to this remote village,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.560]   on the exact opposite side of the world, was well worth it.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.560]   Not because of health care,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   but because of the valuable and precious message of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.560]   Please pray for the India pastors.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   There are 42 pastors,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   and each of them each go to about two to three villages.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   I really saw that they're ordinary people,
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   but I saw that the opposition that they face is very great.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   Not only is it the political climate becoming more difficult for them,
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.560]   but during this pandemic,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   one of the main pastors, Pastor Isaac, passed away from COVID.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.560]   Not only that, there's another core pastor within them, within their midst,
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.560]   one who has been with them for the past 20 years,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.560]   recently fell away from the faith,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   and is actively hindering and opposing their ministry there.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.560]   In actuality, on the first and third day of our medical camps,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.560]   we had to change location on the day of,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   as this former pastor was spreading lies
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   and gathering opposition in the villages we were intending to go to.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   Please pray that they can endure through these hardships,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   and they will not lose heart.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   Pray for the village leaders and Hindu people can turn to Christ.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   Each village has a village leader who acts as the law of the village.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   Pray that these leaders can soften their hearts to Christianity,
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   and that they may come to know Christ.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   Pray for the Hindu people, a people with many gods,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   that they can come to know and worship the one true God.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.560]   Matthew 9.36 says,
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.560]   because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.560]   Then he said to his disciples,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.560]   'The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.'
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.560]   Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore,
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.560]   to send out workers into his harvest field."
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   I hope this year that you would commit to pray for the pastors in India
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   and for the ministry there. Thank you.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   [applause]
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   We're going to spend this time now in offering.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   We have instructions up there and then a box back there
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   if you'd like to physically give.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   But as we pray for offering, let's also pray for our team
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.560]   that's come with the news that they've brought.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.560]   For us, these are such fleeting and passing things,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   convictions and a video that might be lighthearted
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   and make us very happy, encouraged.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   But the work continues, and the enemy doesn't rest,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.560]   and prayers are needed. So let's continue in prayer.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   I'll pray for offering, and then after the praise,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   our brother Caleb's going to be coming up to be baptized this morning.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   Heavenly Father, we pray, God, that again,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   this would not be just a habitual thing we do every week
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   where we drop something into a bucket.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   But Lord, this would be our heart and our desire.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   Father, just as our team went, and just as the pastors there
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   are continuing to labor, here where we are, we are doing the same.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   Father, that our desire is exactly the same.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.560]   We want your kingdom to come and your will to be done.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.560]   And so, Father, I pray that it would be an offering up of our hearts.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   Hello, Breanne. My name is Caleb, and this is my testimony.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   I was born in the church, coming from a Presbyterian Christian background.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   I was baptized at birth, and I spent my whole life going to church.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   I went to Friday nights, retreats, revivals, Harvest Festival, concerts,
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   just everything you can imagine, really.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   I cannot remember the last time I really remember missing church other than being sick.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   My dad is a pastor, my older brother is a youth pastor.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   I was so immersed in the Christian life so much as a young child that I thought my faith was solidified forever.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   Even through different hardships and struggles, I stood firm in what I called faith.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:52.560]   However, in the fall of my junior year, I struggled with something that I could not really easily explain.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   I thought about my faith and whether or not it was really real,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   but at a typical time of healthy skepticism, I wasn't worried.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   However, as I continuously scoured the Internet and I came upon different people,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   I came to realize that there were so many doubts and questions that caused me to think my faith was very shallow.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   I was so passionate about believing in Christ, but I realized there was no knowledgeable foundation.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   I had no answers to any questions non-believers would posit about Christianity.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   I felt like there was nowhere to look and that the questions I had were too specific and too complex for a pastor or any church member to really answer.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   I even lost trust in my parents' guidance when it came to the teachings of Christianity,
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   thinking that the knowledge was too surface level and that they would never understand my confusion.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:51.560]   And I was then afraid because maybe I thought that I would be a disappointment to them
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   and that I failed them while causing them unnecessary suffering of doubting my faith.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   And suddenly I felt so small and the world felt so big.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   Why did so many of these non-believers seem to be so valid in their skepticism, in their militant opposition to theism, to Christianity altogether?
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   I could not dismiss it, and I let the doubt spread like a disease.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   At some point I remember telling myself, "I don't care if my dad or if my older brother are pastors.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   I don't care how many crosses we have in our house, the Bible that we have.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   I don't care about the worship playlist that I collected. I didn't care that I was baptized or confirmed to high school.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:43.560]   If Christianity was wrong and if Jesus Christ is not the Son of God, whom I looked up to for so long,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:49.560]   if he had never died and truly rose again from the dead, if he was not divine,
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.560]   then like Paul says in 1 Corinthians, our faith is in vain."
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   I had been a Christian for so long and I was ready to give up my faith,
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   but we're pursuing a different journey and then just kind of die and fade into nothingness.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:14.560]   The world will never remember me, so what would it matter now if I kept trying to maintain blind, false faith?
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   There is no God, and if there is no God, there is no hope, no purpose for humanity.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.560]   Science was right, atheists were right, and religion was wrong.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   I quickly fell into depression and anxiety that I could not shake for many months.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   Every morning I woke up and I felt empty.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.560]   I stopped doing things that I enjoyed, and even things like eating was very hard for me
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   because of how many questions and confusion that I had that I could not focus.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   Sometimes I would walk out of the house and just go all the way out into the freeway
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   and just kind of drown in dejectedness.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   One day I sat upon, or I climbed up on one of the walls near the freeway
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.560]   and just kind of told myself that maybe death would not be so bad
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   if I could just avoid all this unnecessary pain and suffering since there was no God,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   there was no purpose, and the world would just die away and me along with it.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   Maybe if I passed away I could just see God for myself without having to struggle here on earth.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   Ironically, I remember verbally crying out to the Lord, asking Him to give me the answers.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   I wanted to prove to myself that Jesus Christ was real, and His divinity was real as well.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   I wanted to receive Christ back into my life. I wanted to bring Him glory.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   But all the doubts were plaguing my mind, and it kind of enslaved me.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   But as a well-educated student, I knew that I needed evidence before I just started lashing out and just leaving.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   So for many months I spent countless hours every day, every night,
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   day after day, night after night, just looking for answers.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   So many questions that I had, that plagued my mind, and they weighed very heavy on me every day.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:29.560]   And many of these things I realized, or made me realize that I never really read the Bible in depth for myself,
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   as much as I thought, even though I grew up learning about the Bible,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   even though I tried to evangelize, I didn't really fully understand the true image of Jesus Christ and what He meant for me.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:54.560]   I never fully applied God's message in a way that gave value to me and humanity in general.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.560]   But I eventually figured that we were created in the image of God,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   which gives us a direction of not just moral excellence, but patience and sacrifice,
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   which then gives us a destiny in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:16.560]   After many months, I realized that even after the many times I cried out to the Lord and asked Him,
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:23.560]   "Why can't you reveal yourself? Why do I have to come looking for all these answers?
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.560]   Why do I have to search for all these things that frustrated me?
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   Why do you make it so hard? Why can't you just come down right now? Wouldn't that be much easier?"
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   But I realized that He really had to reveal Himself. It's just that I was not looking in the right places.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:46:07.560]   After a long time, I really came to know that Jesus is the origin, He's the meaning, morality, and destiny of humankind.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   No other worldview would be able to sustain those aspects sufficiently without contradicting reality.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   At the end of it, it was simply undeniable for me.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   After reading and after doing all this research, I saw that there was just truth after truth after truth.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:31.560]   I realized that once I knew that, I could find more joy in my life and a newfound sense of humility and purpose.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   While it took me a while to apply it properly to my behavior in my life at home,
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   I had a deeper purpose in the way I demonstrated myself before others because of the truth that set me free.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   I was not living for others anymore.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   One day, I was reading my devotions in Proverbs like I did every day.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:59.560]   I read chapter 2, verses 3 to 5, it stated that, "Indeed, if you call for insight and cry aloud for understanding,
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God."
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:14.560]   God had started a spiritual awakening as a wake-up call to shatter my worldview so hard
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   that I would turn to him, shake my arrogance, and really seek out his truth
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   and take whatever steps there were to make Christianity all the more real to me,
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.560]   to make the glory and sovereignty of Christ more real to me.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.560]   Christ was simply the answer to everything that I was grappling with,
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   and that he didn't just preach the truth, but he embodied the truth.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   He was the truth that I shunned for so long in my life.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   And I let my arrogance blind me from that.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   The truth has set me free, and through God's grace, I'm a living testament to that.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   And to this day, that's why I'm getting baptized. Thank you.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   [applause]
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   [silence]
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   >> Caleb, do you understand by going into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   and by coming up out of the water, in his newness of life?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.560]   I baptize you now in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   [water pouring]
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   [applause]
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.560]   [silence]
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   >> Okay. Well, thank you, Caleb, for your testimony of faith.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   And I feel like I could recognize maybe some of your family around here.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   And to see the faithfulness, even a long suffering, and the faithfulness that needs to be exhibited,
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.560]   it's very encouraging to see that God is so faithful.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   Let me go ahead and just pray for us, and we'll go right into the sermon today.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.560]   Let's pray.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your great truth.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   Father, just as Caleb said, it's not just the truth that is spoken, but it is the truth embodied.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   Father, that you are God, and that you are good, and that there is nobody like you.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.560]   And Father, we worship you and only you.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   There are no other gods. There are no other things out there that compare.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   Father, you are the creator, and we come before you, and we understand that the word we have in our hands comes from you.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   And so I pray, Father, that every time we come before your word, it would be an exercise of humility,
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   one that desires to hear from our Father and God that it would be the very life in our bones.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   Okay. Well, today we're going to be going through the Tower of Babel.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:29.560]   And before we start that, this is something that I've been thinking about a lot for the last couple years,
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:35.560]   so it kind of comes in and out a lot for me as I've been trying to figure out what does God's will mean?
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:41.560]   Not just to be able to define something like that, but we'll start by reading James 4, verse 13 through 16,
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   where it says, "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.'
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.560]   Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.560]   You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   Instead, you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.'
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil."
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   So we're very cognizant of this, that we are not in control of our lives,
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   and that God is in control of our lives, and that we want to live for God's will and not our will.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.560]   Here, he says something that we would all agree with, hopefully,
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   "If the Lord wills, then we will go about doing all these things."
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   Now, this is the disposition of a Christian that's being talked about,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.560]   because we know that God's will is going to come to pass,
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   but to surrender ourselves to His will is what we see here.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   But this also doesn't mean that we're supposed to go around and before every comment that we make,
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.560]   "Oh, if God wills, then I'm going to eat dinner tonight.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.560]   If God wills, then I'll be able to drive home."
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   It's not that, and yet, it's kind of all that.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.560]   Everything about our lives is swallowed up in this understanding of the Lord's will.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   Now, we know that's hard, because how many things in our lives are we, today, living outside of His will?
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.560]   We're not going to go into decreed and desired will.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:13.560]   There are different kinds of wills, but outside of what He wants for us,
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.560]   how much of our lives falls there?
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.560]   And in verse 16, where it says, "But as it is, you boast in your arrogance,"
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:25.560]   and it talks about somebody who lives for his own will, not as just mistaken,
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:30.560]   or a little bit off course, he says, "This kind of living is evil."
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.560]   It's evil. It's arrogance.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   It's kind of boasting, self-will, thinking that I can wake up and do whatever it is that I want,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   plan whatever it is that I want, go and accomplish whatever it is that I want,
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   go after the things that I want to go after.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   This kind of will is evil.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.560]   So, this being the common disposition to the Christian,
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   we have to ask ourselves if we actually believe this.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Now, some of the wisdom texts that we're going to be looking at will point to God's sovereignty in our lives.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   In Job 42, it says, "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:16.560]   In Psalm 115.3, "But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases."
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.560]   Proverbs 69, "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   Proverbs 19.21, "Many plans are in a man's heart, but the counsel of the Lord will stand."
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.560]   These are wisdom texts.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   So, what this means is that if we agree to these texts, if we look at this and we say,
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.560]   "Yeah, I believe that," but we live outside of it,
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.560]   we're not living in accordance to it,
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.560]   that we are not subjecting ourselves to the truth of it.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.560]   It's called foolishness.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:50.560]   It's not wisdom we're living in, because we're saying we believe it, and we say it with our mouths,
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.560]   and perhaps that's how we would commonly display our lives to be,
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   and yet at the heart and at the core, whatever it is that we're living for,
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.560]   that big gap is called foolishness.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:10.560]   And James goes on to say that that is boasting and arrogance or evil.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.560]   What we see in today's world is a world that's full of people who are daily,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.560]   minute by minute, heartbeat by heartbeat, living in defiance before God's will.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   This is the world.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.560]   This is the fallen world,
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   and we're going to be looking at the Tower of Babel to see it.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   So the first point is going to be the context before the Tower of Babel.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   We're going to go through Genesis 1-10 and do a quick overview.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.560]   And the context is basically it's all pointing towards death.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.560]   And so the idea of this is going to be that God's will, God's desire,
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   is always going to be pointing towards life,
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:50.560]   but human will is always going to be pointing towards destruction and death,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.560]   and that's what we see in the first 10 chapters of Genesis.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.560]   He says to Adam and Eve when they first come onto the scene in Genesis 1-28,
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.560]   "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth."
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   If you remember, Adam and Eve had sinned.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   They don't live for God's kingdom.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.560]   They don't live for God's will.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.560]   They live for their own will, their own desires.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Aside from all the deepening theology that we can go into this story,
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.560]   if you want to put it very simplistically,
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   they did not want what God wanted, and they wanted what they wanted.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.560]   It was a battle of wills,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:30.560]   and at that moment sin enters into the world because that's what that battle is.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:37.560]   When humanity comes up against God's will and fights and rebels, it's sin.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:44.560]   And with sin came death, destruction.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.560]   That's the immediate repercussion of this.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   It's death.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.560]   So in the genealogy that we see in Genesis 5, it's the common theme.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   It comes in right away,
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.560]   not only with just Cain and Abel and a single murder that happened right away.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.560]   But if you look at Genesis 5-3,
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.560]   "When Adam had lived 130 years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness,
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   according to his image, and named him Seth.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.560]   Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were 800 years,
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   and he had other sons and daughters.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   So all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died."
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.560]   It's very tempting to look at this and marvel.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   You marvel. Why?
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   Because he lived 930 years.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   He lived 930 years, and we sit there and go, "Wow, that's a lot of life."
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   But is that what this passage was meaning to convey?
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   No. What it was going to convey is that there is death.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   We don't think it's remarkable that he lives 930 years.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   It's remarkable that he dies.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   It says, "was made in Adam's image."
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.560]   Seth is made in Adam's image, in the image of a sinner,
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   where Adam was made in God's image.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   Now he is made in the image of Adam,
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   who is pursuing the will of man and not God's.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.560]   I mean, this death that's introduced, it's not a slow devolution.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   It's the common theme.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   If you look at Genesis 5-5,
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.560]   all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.560]   All the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.560]   All the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.560]   All the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   All the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.560]   All the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   All the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:39.560]   Different names, different ages, same result.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.560]   Whether someone lives 700 years, whether someone lives 900 years,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.560]   the result is the same.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.560]   Death. And death is just not the finishing of a human,
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.560]   just a physical body.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.560]   We're talking about eternal punishment that they enter into.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.560]   Death.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.560]   This is the immediate ramification of sin,
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:05.560]   of humans who pursue their own will, and not God's will.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.560]   See, God's will is always the way of life.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.560]   Human will without God only leads to death.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.560]   It is the inevitable end.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   During this time, we see that humans were living somewhere between 700 and 900 years.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.560]   It's a mind-blowing concept, right?
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.560]   Can you imagine?
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   And as death is introduced into the world, again,
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:32.560]   the point is not that all these men lived that long.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.560]   The point is that death reigned.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   Romans 5.12, "Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.560]   and death through sin, and so death spread to all men,
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.560]   because all sinned."
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   It's the result. It's the punishment.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   It is the payment for sin.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.560]   Death.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   We like to think about sin as just things.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.560]   Things we do, thoughts we have.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.560]   Sin is so much more than these things that we can accomplish.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.560]   Sin has everything to do with a sinful heart.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.560]   And that's what total depravity is.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.560]   It's a heart that has completely gone into this place
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.560]   where it is self-willed, self-desiring, selfish,
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:19.560]   and wants only my things, not God's.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.560]   That's what brings death.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.560]   It's humans who desire their own things.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:29.560]   Their own lives always will make way to destruction.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   Take a moment to take that in.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.560]   It doesn't mean that at every moment,
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   if you look at Genesis 6.5, let's look at 6.5.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   "And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth,
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.560]   Does that mean that at every moment,
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   somebody was thinking of killing someone?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   Of raping someone?
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   Of stealing?
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   Of destroying?
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   That's not what that is saying.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   This passage is saying that this was the inclination of every heart.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.560]   That evil is not being defined by the greatest pictures of sin,
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.560]   but that the heart was sinful.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   The entirety of what sin is is rebellion against God.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.560]   And therefore, the sins that we see are just fruits.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   It's the resulting, the repercussion,
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   the aspects that come out as a result of the sin
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.560]   that we have already taken into our hearts.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.560]   To live for personal will, not God's will.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   To live for personal kingdom, not God's kingdom.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.560]   To live for my desires, not God's desires.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.560]   That's death.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   That's a death sentence.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.560]   It is not only a punishment given by God,
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   it is also the natural result of sin.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   The proud, self-willed, human heart.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.560]   And so what we see is God proceeds then to wipe out everyone,
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   except Noah and his family,
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   in a worldwide flood.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   And we think that this is a terrible thing for God to do.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.560]   No, it's not.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.560]   The fact of the matter is,
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   he executes what every human being already deserved.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.560]   Whether somebody dies in a flood at 20,
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.560]   or whether somebody is living 777 years old,
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.560]   the death, the result, is the same.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.560]   Right?
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.560]   That doesn't matter.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.560]   Everything ends up in the same place.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   We don't look up at God and say,
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   "Oh, man, but if you let him live 900 years,
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.560]   that would have been fine."
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.560]   The fact that the perished humans had that much time to live
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.560]   ought to make us question God's goodness and justice.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:49.560]   How could God allow them to even live?
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.560]   Once the flood abates,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.560]   God repeats the very same command he gave to Adam and Eve.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.560]   This thing, again, the same command that God gave to Adam and Eve,
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.560]   and now he's cleansed the slate.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.560]   He's made it so, you know, after the rain falls
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.560]   and everything just looks clean,
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.560]   everything looks beautiful, and the birds are chirping,
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.560]   everything smells better.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.560]   The entire world,
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560]   the rain came over the entire world,
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.560]   everything looked clean, it looked like a brand new slate.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.560]   It was like, "We can do this!"
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560]   And God gives them the same command,
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth."
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   The stuff of life to fill, to produce,
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.560]   to fill the earth with life, that gives life,
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.560]   and to pass that on.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.560]   And this is the will of God.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.560]   But what we see is the very same thing.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.560]   Nothing changes.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.560]   Sin and death continues.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.560]   Evil continues to spread.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   And just as the devolution was swift and immediate after Adam and Eve,
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.560]   even though God gives renewed hope to humanity after the flood,
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560]   it says in Genesis 9.28,
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.560]   "Noah lived 350 years after the flood."
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.560]   So all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   He was the last of them to live that long.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.560]   And he actually started to outlive his children and his grandchildren
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.560]   because death was spiraling.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.560]   To the point, you get to Genesis 12,
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.560]   people are living under 200 years.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560]   It's the same old, same old.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   You see that Noah and his family got to see the firsthand result of sin.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.560]   They got to see what happens when human will takes over
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.560]   and God's will comes up against that.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.560]   Even though Noah's immediate family knew this,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.560]   they deviate so far off course so quickly
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   that what is just in probably about a few hundred years,
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.560]   we're trekking towards the story of the Tower of Babel in Chapter 11.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.560]   Humanity has already created their own false gods.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.560]   This is nearing the time in history called the Ancient Near East,
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.560]   near the Fertile Crescent.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.560]   It was the dawn of civilization when nomads roamed the earth.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.560]   And according to James Boyce and historical record,
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   we know that essentially the identities of all the various gods and goddesses
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   of Rome, Greece, India, Egypt, and so on,
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.560]   were birthed from this location.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.560]   It was from Babylon, and this Tower of Babel was the birthplace of Babylon.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.560]   The people during Babel were already beginning to create false gods
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:18.560]   while Noah was around.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.560]   As they did that, they did it largely through astrology.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   It's known in history that the Chaldeans, also known as the Babylonians,
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.560]   began astrology, the Chaldeans being another name for the people of Babylon.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   And from here originated all ancient world religions.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.560]   And remember, with Noah, because his own family,
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.560]   the eight of them that were rescued from the flood,
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.560]   were all that were left of humans, everyone that was a son or a daughter
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   that was born would what?
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.560]   They would speak the same language, right?
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   It doesn't even have to be said.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.560]   When you have kids, they just start speaking the language that you speak.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   But before Genesis 11, while everything is still Noah's family,
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.560]   look at what happens in Genesis 10, verse 5.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   [Reading]
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.560]   Like a savvy reader would look at that and be like, wait, what?
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   Out of one family, but why are there languages now?
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.560]   [Reading]
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.560]   And then the second son, Genesis 10.20.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   [Reading]
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.560]   Shem, these are the sons of Shem.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   [Reading]
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   And out of these, the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.560]   So it's a natural question that comes up.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.560]   If there is only one family, how are there languages in chapter 10?
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.560]   How are there nations?
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   Why is everything separating?
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.560]   Why is everyone being scattered?
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:52.560]   And so we come to the story of the Tower of Babel.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   The Tower of Babel is actually a story of the people of the land of Israel.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.560]   And so we come to the story of the Tower of Babel.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.560]   The Tower of Babel is actually a story of God's intervening hand
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   and man's plunge towards death.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   Chapter 11 tells us two wills that are running side by side.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.560]   There's man's will and there's God's will.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.560]   Man's will leading to immediate and obvious death, and God's will,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   we're going to be seeing the redemption plan of life to save mankind.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:27.560]   Not to live to a ripe old age of 800 or 900 years old,
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.560]   but eternal life, true life.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   So Genesis 11, verse 1 through 9.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.560]   If you haven't yet turned there, you can turn there with me now.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   This is our second point.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.560]   This is the narrative of the Tower of Babel.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.560]   Verse 1.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.560]   Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   As soon as you see this, again,
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.560]   he's trying to make that link, just kind of the pin right there, right?
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   The pivoting point.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   The whole earth used the same language.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   That's a no-does statement.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   If there's one family, there should be one language.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   It says that they used the same words even.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   That's called repetition, right?
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.560]   He's trying to drive into us the tension that was built in Chapter 10,
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.560]   that there's a scattering that happened,
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.560]   and now he's going to tell us a story of why and how that happens.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   This is letter A, the world God's way.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.560]   God has always desired a filling of the earth to his glory.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   Remember what he said to Adam and Eve?
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.560]   He said again to Noah.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   He says to fill the earth because that's what image bearers do.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.560]   Image bearers point.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.560]   Image bearers give glory.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   The point was that people would fill the earth with the image of God,
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.560]   thereby bringing God glory.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.560]   And these people would be one in mind, one in heart, because why?
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.560]   They bore the resemblance of the same God.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:56.560]   Now, what we saw is that Seth was made in the image of Adam,
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.560]   which wouldn't be a problem if Adam were still in the image of God, right?
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:07.560]   Like something perverted, something changed here.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560]   Verse 1 here continues to build tension into us in this.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.560]   Unity has been broken.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.560]   Division has occurred in a place where God was always meaning to bring his
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.560]   people together for the same purpose.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.560]   See, if this family, Noah's family, were the same family,
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.560]   they all spoke the same way.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.560]   It's not just common language.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   It's their body language.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   It's the intricacies, the intonations, the inflections.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.560]   They just knew each other.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.560]   Like there was just a oneness here.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   And as they grew in size, they began to have to go outwards,
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   perhaps an uncle's flock of sheep got too big here,
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   and so people would have to move out.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.560]   And this became a very scary thing to them.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.560]   And so that's what we see coming up to chapter 11, verse 1.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.560]   These men were moving eastward, and finally they found a plain in Shinar,
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.560]   a place that was very fertile in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560]   So they come up with this plan there.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560]   It's their plan.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   They come up with something that is their will, their desires,
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   their ambitions at their kingdom.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.560]   That's what we see going here into verse 2.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.560]   So let's look at that.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.560]   This is the world man's way.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.560]   Not united to bring God's glory, but in Genesis 11, 2,
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.560]   "It came about as they journeyed east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.560]   and settled there.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.560]   They said to one another, 'Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.'
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.560]   And they used brick for stone and they used tar for mortar.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560]   They said, 'Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.560]   whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name,
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.560]   otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.'
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:38.560]   And here they are questioning, going up against God's will.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.560]   Let's band together.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.560]   Let's go inwards into a city, into a metropolis, a man to pursue his own glory
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.560]   instead of uniting to God's glory, to fill the earth with it,
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   instead of accomplishing God's purposes, instead of trusting in their Lord,
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   the one who saved their entire family, by the way.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.560]   We see here in the quick devolution of sin,
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.560]   a story that seems to continue what we saw in Genesis 6, 5,
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.560]   that the thoughts were evil always, continually,
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.560]   not because they're going around murdering everyone in sight,
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.560]   but because of their will.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   That's what sin is.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   It's self-will.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.560]   It's what I want, not what God wants.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.560]   Even with the differences people might have,
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.560]   the core of sin is the same in every fallen human.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.560]   Though there ought to be unity in bringing God's glory together,
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.560]   what we see in the world today, just as it was then,
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   a unity in the broken world,
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   in that all we want is what we want.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560]   We want to be God.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.560]   We want to sit on the throne.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560]   We want to call the shots.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.560]   We want to make our own decisions.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.560]   We want to fulfill the Lord with our own glory.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   Now that sounds so dramatic, but that's what's happening.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:11.560]   Not just in the world, but do you not sense it in your heart?
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560]   This is the same heart in every human born into sin,
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560]   and it directly results into death.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.560]   You see it there in verse 4, don't you?
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.560]   "Let us make for ourselves a name,
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.560]   otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:29.560]   And so the problem isn't just trying to stop ourselves from committing major and overt sin,
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.560]   it's this will of ours.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.560]   In this time, man's sin is seen in bolder, more concentrated ways.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.560]   Why? Because they were united.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.560]   Man can accomplish a lot when you're united.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.560]   Do you know why? Because that's what God made it to be.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.560]   Except that unity was always meant to enhance his glory,
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.560]   but in sin, man will enhance his own glory.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   Unity will always enhance efficiency, strategy, strength, corporate resolve.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:10.560]   We'll root each other on in whatever accomplishment it is that we're trying to go for.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   Now what happens if this unity is in the context of sin?
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.560]   Personal ambitions and will, not God's.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560]   Perhaps their actions seem innocent enough.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.560]   Perhaps they have their reasons.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   Maybe they remember all the animals that were released out of the ark,
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.560]   and they were also proliferating into the world.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560]   And that's scary, right?
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   A bunch of lions are just having a bunch of babies everywhere.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560]   That's scary.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.560]   Maybe they were afraid because the land masses are beginning to drift apart.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.560]   As their population is increasing,
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   maybe they're afraid of the fact that they're getting spread apart like this.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.560]   Maybe they're afraid of the rapidly falling lifespan.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.560]   But it didn't change the fact that God said to fill the earth,
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.560]   to go and to reach the ends of it, to his glory.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560]   See, they didn't trust God,
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.560]   and perhaps they were afraid that God's plan would be against their best interests.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560]   In living a life of comfort and ease,
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   their will was for themselves, their kingdoms, their safety, their names,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.560]   to build up something that God, they were afraid.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   Because if God's will did not align with their will,
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.560]   then they're afraid of that.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.560]   Even though they were created to have their will aligned with God's will.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.560]   The backwards nature of this.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   And so humans began Babel's construction,
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.560]   and they had hope in its completion.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560]   They said to one another in verse 3,
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560]   "Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly."
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.560]   And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   And so all the ingenuity that God had given them,
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   they're beginning to use this so that they can go after what they want.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.560]   So they burned together these bricks and began constructing upward into the sky,
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   this tower that goes into the heavens.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.560]   And it probably resembled a ziggurat-like structure.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   Interestingly, every ancient culture had some sort of ziggurat,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.560]   which corresponds to this biblical reality in history,
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.560]   that all civilizations came from this place.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   Hence the commonality in origin stories.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.560]   See, the ziggurats were towers with square bases,
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560]   and they could have different details to them,
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.560]   but they were all common in that they were supposed to be structures
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.560]   that at the pinnacle brought them closer to reach the gods in the skies.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:29.560]   Celestial beings to worship.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.560]   And in this world where already false gods were running rampant,
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.560]   just going everywhere, spreading,
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   united humanity was coming together.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:42.560]   Although there are many gods, the heart of man was the same
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   against the one true God.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   Uniting to create a world where the power of God could be harnessed
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.560]   to accomplish their will.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   Have you ever thought of idolatry, what it is?
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   Idol worship? Isn't idol worship kind of strange?
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.560]   If you think about it, idol worship has always been--
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.560]   idolatry has always been to harness the power of God,
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   to get what you want.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   You worship something so that they will give you what you want.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.560]   In essence, idol worship or idolatry is,
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.560]   I'll worship you, but it's actually for you to worship me.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   I'll serve you, but it's actually for you to serve me.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.560]   And so because humanity understands their weakness,
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.560]   that they can't accomplish the things that they want to accomplish,
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.560]   their will is weak and feeble,
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.560]   and they can't even sustain themselves.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.560]   So they have to, in essence, turn to God.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.560]   And so as they turn to God, they worship God because God is powerful,
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   but the image of what's going on there is not because they want to actually
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.560]   give Him glory, it's because they want what He can offer.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.560]   That's really dangerous.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   This is so much scarier than outright rebellion.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.560]   We want to build up our own lives, our own kingdoms, and our own thrones.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.560]   We want our comfort and our reputation and our communities.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   We want to eat what we want to eat.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.560]   We want to visit where we want to visit.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.560]   We want to do what we want to do.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   And we want God's plans to be a side point in our lives, not the center.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.560]   This is sin.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.560]   Sin is not just the individual actions that we can list out.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   It's the individual thoughts that we can list out.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560]   Sin comes from a heart of sin,
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560]   a sin that is perverted and corrupt.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.560]   A single sin in the human life is not an isolated incident.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560]   It says so much about who that person is,
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.560]   and they all seem to kind of come together at the same point,
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.560]   the commonality of human pride, boasting, ego, arrogance,
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:58.560]   and we're all the same in that.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.560]   Coupled with, of course, a distrust of God,
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.560]   a hardened unbelief in our hearts to His promises,
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.560]   to His character, to what He says,
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:15.560]   a refusal to let go in the will of our lives.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:21.560]   Does this not seem closer to us than we thought?
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.560]   We can look out at an unbelieving world,
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.560]   but how many professing believers are currently living like this?
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.560]   On the outside, it might be a display of serving God,
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.560]   but on the inside, the desire is to harness Him,
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   to put a bit in His mouth and to reign Him in
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:44.560]   so that He can do what I need Him to do.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.560]   They didn't say, "Let's build a tower that has our faces emblazoned on it."
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.560]   They didn't say, "Let's make this ziggurat
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.560]   and then just put our name right on the top of it."
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.560]   They did it to reach God.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.560]   Wow.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.560]   And so our prayers, and I've been so encouraged by our church.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.560]   I think there's been so much prayer going on.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   It's been really cool to see.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.560]   And because we're recognizing it,
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   but aren't we, because we're praying so much more often,
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.560]   like, aren't you with me right now where it feels like,
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.560]   "Wow, my prayers were so, so messed up at times."
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560]   It can be so wrought.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.560]   Our prayers can be so wrought with this kind of fleshly and sinful thinking
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.560]   that we pray to God for our careers.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.560]   We pray to God for our education, for our children,
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.560]   our food, our comfort, our peace, our entertainment.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560]   And that's what God is there for.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.560]   He's our personal ziggurat.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.560]   He's there for us, and we only worship Him
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.560]   because we need Him to give us what I want.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.560]   Not need Him because of Him, not need Him because of who He is,
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.560]   not need Him because we have nothing else,
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   but because I need somebody who can take control of a life that I can't take control of,
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.560]   so you do it for me and give me what I want.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.560]   How many of us have been constructing a Tower of Babel reaching to the heavens
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.560]   with the express purpose of making a name for self?
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:15.560]   And frighteningly, how do we not know Bereanism being built like this?
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.560]   Saying the right things about serving and worshiping God,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.560]   understanding in the mind and knowing the right things,
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.560]   that He is strong, that He is sovereign,
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.560]   that I am weak, that I am feeble and unable,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   and in all that, building up our own kingdom.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.560]   We must see that the danger to this is always much closer than we think,
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.560]   that the enemy works in much subtler, much more quiet,
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.560]   devious, hidden ways.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   He is not going to say, "Build this thing so that you can worship yourself."
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.560]   He's going to be lurking, nudging, causing questions, challenging.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.560]   Like with Caleb's testimony, right?
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:07.560]   It was just nudging, like, "How do you know?"
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:14.560]   Did God really say, "Is this who He is?
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.560]   Is this the best way?"
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560]   We have to see the sinful tendency in us,
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   because those questions, when we answer it,
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.560]   is going to be the crossroads, whether we choose to follow God's will
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.560]   or whether we decide we're going to take over.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:35.560]   We have to see the sinful tendency in us to say the right things
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.560]   while being completely about our own will and desires and not God's.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560]   You see, our desires are not only rebellious, but they're weak.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.560]   Our desires are to set up something temporary.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.560]   Our desires are for things that fade.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.560]   Our desires are for things that will harm us.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.560]   Our desires, when you think about it, it doesn't even make sense to us,
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.560]   logically speaking.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.560]   God wants far more for us than that.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   God wants us to have life, an abundant life.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   God wants us to stop pursuing our own will.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:08.560]   This isn't prosperity gospel. This is the truth.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.560]   God wants us to have life that we were meant for,
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.560]   and that necessarily means that in His will,
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.560]   we must die to the world.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.560]   We must die to our personal ambitions and desires
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.560]   and find what it is to find our desires in His desires,
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.560]   trusting that His ways are higher, that His ways are loftier,
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:36.560]   greater, better, and perfect.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.560]   So much so that we would live in simple obedience,
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560]   childlike obedience before Him.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.560]   Just say, "I trust what He says.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.560]   I'll listen to Him. I'll do what He wants."
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:55.560]   So we live in a world that is filled with evil, rebellious people.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.560]   There's a disturbing unity in this,
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.560]   this rebellious desire.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.560]   In an unbelieving world, that danger lurks even amongst us
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.560]   because we are unaware many times of our current state,
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560]   of what sin actually is.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:19.560]   It's just not trying to stop lusting or lying.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.560]   We see this unity happening in the globalized world we live in.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.560]   Me-centered, me, me, me.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.560]   I matter. I am valuable. I am worth it.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   I'll do whatever it takes to protect myself.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.560]   God serves me. That's the world.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.560]   It's the spirit of the Antichrist at work.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.560]   It mimics spirituality. It mimics religion.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.560]   It's not just like atheism and just like, you know.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.560]   We don't have time. We don't have time to go into it. Never mind.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.560]   I've got to resist the temptation. Let's go to letter C.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.560]   God's solution to man's way.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.560]   Chapter 11, verse 5-9. So let's see how God responds to that.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.560]   Genesis 11-5.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:24.560]   [Reading]
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:29.560]   Now this is a clear picture of how God responds to human will.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.560]   God, as it says in Galatians 6, will not be mocked.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   He will not be scorned. He will not be ridiculed.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.560]   He will not be treated with contempt.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.560]   What we saw with Jesus walking to the cross and subjecting himself to the crucifixion
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.560]   was not because he was powerless before humans and their will.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.560]   It's because he was living out his will.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:58.560]   This was his purposeful, intentional decision to march to the cross.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.560]   It was not a whip on his back.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.560]   It was not steel nails that held him.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:12.560]   It was him, his will, and his obedience to the Father's will.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   That scorn, that contempt, that ridiculing that came from the hands of man?
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.560]   Do you think that just goes away?
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:26.560]   That because we believe there is forgiveness, that's gone?
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   God is a God of perfect justice.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.560]   No one gets away with anything. Not a single thing.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.560]   And so you will either pay the judgment, the justice that needs to be paid, with your own life,
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   or you place your faith in the one who can take it.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.560]   And that's always been God's will.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.560]   This is a humorous story.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.560]   We should be laughing at this story.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.560]   We should be looking at this story and going, "What are they doing?"
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.560]   This giant tower, the ones, these humans are putting all their energy into it.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.560]   They're trying so hard to build this thing up.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   They're sweating as they're painstakingly shaping these bricks together
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.560]   and they're burning it with mortar and they have to go in front of a fire.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.560]   Have you ever been really in front of a fire before?
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.560]   You're sweating and you're getting all charred.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.560]   You lose your eyebrows. Everything is bad about this situation.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   And they're waking up sore.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.560]   They're so feeble, only to get another layer of bricks up.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:37.560]   Some of them died as they're constructing this thing.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.560]   And even then, it's like, "Oh, we have a long way to go in this."
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.560]   It was an unfinished tower.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.560]   Cut and bruised.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.560]   Weak and poor.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560]   And then God, it says that He has to come down.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   The words are very purposeful.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   He comes down from the lofty heights that He resides.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   He comes down to see these humans putting all their energy into this thing.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   Because it was too small. He couldn't see it.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   He could see it, but it was just too small.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.560]   He came down and He looks.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.560]   I'm like, "What are you doing?"
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:14.560]   Because this is a God who chapters before just spoke the world into existence
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.560]   and built everything.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:24.560]   The atoms, the molecules, the sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, water, fish, birds, animals, everything.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560]   Humans!
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.560]   With His words.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.560]   These humans building up this thing.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.560]   To try to harness God.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.560]   Human will versus God.
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:47.560]   He says, "Are you laughing with me?"
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   Remembers, there's a TV show called "Pinky and the Brain." Have you ever seen that?
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   No? Okay, we'll move on.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.560]   If you read carefully at what's going on here, God simply reverses exactly what the people were doing.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   They have one language and they've unified to make their name great.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:12.560]   It's almost as if it's simple. It's time to come and step down and confuse their language.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.560]   Humans said, "Come, let us go and build this." And God says, "Come, let us go and stop this."
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:22.560]   Where man was trying to build this up, God just thinks and it's done.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   Foolishness.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.560]   These humans thought they could challenge the Almighty God.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.560]   The One who sustained everything about them.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:38.560]   See, we make our plans. We pour our sweat into studying and working and building day and night.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.560]   And we say we're going to do this or that.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   And we're going to go there and enjoy this and go there and accomplish this.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.560]   But who are we to work to personal ambition and will?
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.560]   Blind to the fact that I exist for God's glory.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.560]   That's a lie if we live in that lie.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.560]   That is evil if we live in that lie.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.560]   We work so hard and looking for what is best for ourselves.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.560]   And so we think, "If it so happens that following God is what is best for me, then I won't feel guilty all week.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.560]   I'll just do whatever it is. This is what I want.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.560]   And if God's will matches up with mine, then great.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.560]   I'll go to church. I'll serve. I'll do everything that needs to be done."
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:26.560]   But if God's commands goes against what you really want, you typically just turn the other way.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   We've defined things. We've created standards and rubrics of what Christianity is.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   That I will give God these things, but really my life is still my own.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   It is not.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.560]   If you're a Christian in here today, you do not belong to yourself.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.560]   Your decisions are not to be made for yourself.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.560]   Your life is not meant to reflect your own glory.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.560]   You are not here for your own personal reputation.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.560]   You are not here for your personal enjoyment.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:56.560]   All of it is meant to be found in God.
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:04.560]   And only when it's found in God does all of that fall into place.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.560]   God always works things to His purposes.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.560]   And He always fulfills His plans.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.560]   Even when we think, "Maybe, just maybe I can beat this system of God's.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.560]   Maybe, just maybe I can go against God's plans."
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.560]   You will kick. You will scream against God.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.560]   But He is too powerful for you.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:29.560]   Who are we to resist His will?
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.560]   He doesn't even break a sweat in frustrating our plans if they are not in line with His.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.560]   God's plan is not that we would expand our own kingdom and names.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.560]   Even in those subtly deceptive ways.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.560]   But to live to His.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.560]   I'm going to read a quote from Arthur Pink.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.560]   "The God of this 20th century no more resembles the supreme sovereign of Holy Writ
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.560]   than does the dim flickering of a candle, the glory of the midday sun.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.560]   The God who is now talked about in the average pulpit,
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.560]   spoken of in the ordinary Sunday school,
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.560]   mentioned in much of the religious literature of the day,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.560]   and preached in most of the so-called Bible conferences,
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:10.560]   is the figment of human imagination, an invention of maudlin sentimentality.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.560]   The heathen outside of the pale of Christendom form gods out of wood and stone."
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.560]   Now take a breath here.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.560]   Before we read this next part.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:29.560]   "While millions of heathen inside Christendom manufacture a god out of their own carnal mind.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:36.560]   In reality they are but atheists.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   For there is no other possible alternative between an absolutely supreme God and no God at all.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.560]   A God whose will is resisted, whose designs are frustrated, whose purpose is checkmated,
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:55.560]   possesses not title to deity, and so far from being a fit object of worship merits not but contempt."
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.560]   That's Arthur Pink.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.560]   There's no middle ground to this.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:07.560]   And we try to give a little bit more of our will and we feed it, we drip it into how we live day by day.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.560]   It is all or nothing.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.560]   Is that not how we became Christians?
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:19.560]   That we surrendered everything.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:27.560]   That is the entrance point to Christianity, not something we built to.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:32.560]   And this was the result of humanity assembling together in unity at Babel.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.560]   They're scattered.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560]   Look at Psalm 2.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.560]   "And there the nations in an uproar, and the peoples devising a vain thing.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:45.560]   The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His anointed,
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.560]   saying, 'Let us tear their fetters apart and cast away their cords from us.'
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.560]   He who sits in the heavens laughs, the Lord scoffs at them.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.560]   Then He will speak to them in His anger and terrify them in His fury, saying,
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:00.560]   'But as for me, I have installed my King upon Zion, my holy mountain.'"
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:03.560]   There was a time when I thought that this was so petty of God.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.560]   That God would be so worried about humans uniting in this way,
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.560]   that He would come down and confuse their language.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:11.560]   I thought that was so petty.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:19.560]   Until I had to do that, like a shake of the head, clear up my eyes to see what was actually going on.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.560]   God's not afraid of humanity.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:28.560]   Who is He to be afraid of humanity and what they can accomplish?
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.560]   We're watching God's abounding grace in action.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:39.560]   This is God inserting Himself into the downward plummet of humanity.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.560]   One that barrels towards death.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:48.560]   Every human born barreling towards death because will leads them there.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:55.560]   We're seeing what humans do, how quickly humans devolve, how quickly humans will kill each other off and be destroyed.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.560]   Do we not see that in the world around us?
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:02.560]   That their efforts might be to unite, create, do good and great things with the perversion of sin.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.560]   It will always lead towards destruction and death.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:12.560]   The only unity that truly binds humanity together is sin.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:18.560]   The only unity that truly binds humanity together is personal ambition and desire to overthrow God.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.560]   So that we can take control of our own lives.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:25.560]   Creating a Godless society that has no ability to actively and actually love each other.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.560]   We've seen the results not only in the first chapters in Genesis but in society at large.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:37.560]   And so He so graciously scatters them because they're barreling towards death faster than they realize.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.560]   And so He spreads them apart.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.560]   What grace of God.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:50.560]   Because when they come together, there is a lot of human will that comes together.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.560]   Their strategy gets better, they get strengthened.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:59.560]   You know, like the unity, all that stuff happens.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.560]   So in Genesis 11, 9, our final verse here.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.560]   In this passage, before I read a few others to conclude.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.560]   "Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of the whole earth.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.560]   And from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth."
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:20.560]   After this, right after this, you see the human age drop to under 200 years old.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:25.560]   It just drops.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560]   Now, to conclude.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.560]   What I was trying to show is that there is human will and God's will.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:36.560]   And this world is barreling down that thing of human will, personal will and ambition.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.560]   And we see this in the Ark of Scripture.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.560]   In fact, remember this was Babel.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.560]   This is the beginning of the Bible, right?
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:45.560]   We saw it.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.560]   But it is actually the beginning, middle and end.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.560]   We see the same thing going on.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.560]   And he purposely, I think God purposely does this.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   Because when we get to the middle, right?
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.560]   In one of the prophets, in Daniel 3, 4, he says, "Then the herald loudly proclaimed,
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.560]   'To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music,
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.560]   you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.'"
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.560]   So Babylon, remember that's the birthplace of Babel, the birthplace of Babylon.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.560]   That the same thing is happening.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:22.560]   That King Nebuchadnezzar comes up as a king and he tries to gather all the people of the world to unite,
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.560]   ironically, to worship this image that was set up of Nebuchadnezzar.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.560]   Really interesting.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560]   That's the middle of the Bible.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.560]   We get to the end in Revelation 17, 15.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560]   This is a passage talking also about Babylon.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.560]   "And he said to me, 'The waters which you saw where the harlot," that's her, "sits,
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:40.560]   are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues," you see that?
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.560]   "The gathering and the unity of the people, and the ten horns which you saw, and the beast,
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.560]   these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked,
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.560]   and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:54.560]   For God has put it in their hearts to execute his purpose."
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.560]   Look at this though.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:00.560]   "By having a common purpose," this unified purpose against God,
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.560]   "God has set that in their heart until the words of God will be fulfilled.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.560]   The woman whom you saw is a great city which reigns over the kings of the earth."
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:13.560]   And then later on, it shows that Babylon is plunked into the ocean,
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.560]   and then there's no more ripple.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   It's gone.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.560]   Human will is barreling towards this thing to come together.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.560]   And if you read the book of Revelation, you see the end.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.560]   But here's how God wanted to.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.560]   To bring it back to how he wanted it to be.
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:36.560]   In Acts 2, 5, "But now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:39.560]   And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together and were bewildered
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.560]   because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language."
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560]   Notice that these are all Jews.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.560]   These are not just people from every nation.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.560]   These aren't Gentiles.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.560]   These are Jews that were speaking different languages.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.560]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:54.560]   The same family speaking different languages.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:01.560]   "They were amazed and astonished, saying, 'Why are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.560]   And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.560]   Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia,
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.560]   Pontus and Asia, Phyrgia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya,
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.560]   and Cyrene and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs,
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.560]   we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.'
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.560]   And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity,
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:25.560]   saying to one another, 'What does this mean?'"
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560]   God bringing people together.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.560]   And do you know what this is?
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.560]   This is the birth and the advent of the church.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:39.560]   The people of God coming together to preach God, to preach the gospel.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:43.560]   This is the beginning of evangelism of the church.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.560]   To go out, to spread out.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.560]   Do you see this?
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560]   This is His mission.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:53.560]   It was always to go to the ends of the earth.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.560]   To accomplish the will of God, His great commands, His desire,
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:02.560]   which is that none should perish but all to come to repentance.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.560]   So what is God's will for you and for me?
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.560]   Vacations?
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.560]   Food?
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.560]   Retirement?
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.560]   Or is it to be His people, to go out to the ends of the earth,
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:31.560]   to share the gospel, His will for life to flow through the world and not death?
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.560]   Revelation 7, 9, to conclude, "And after all these things I looked,
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.560]   and behold, a great multitude which no one could count,
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560]   from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues,
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.560]   standing before the throne, and before the Lamb,
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.560]   clothed in white robes and palm branches were in their hands,
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:48.560]   and they cry out with a loud voice, saying, 'This is what He has always wanted,
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.560]   salvation to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.'"
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:39:04.560]   Let's pray.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.560]   Heavenly Father, we pray God that our will would break before Yours
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.560]   and that we would surrender and yield.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:18.560]   And God, we would not do this with such a burden upon us,
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.560]   but with joy, with desire,
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   that what we do is not so far apart from our hearts' wants.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.560]   There is no satisfaction anywhere else in this world
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.560]   in the pursuits that might have distracted us.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.560]   Nothing, nothing better than serving You.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.560]   Would you all stand for a closing praise?
