[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We get loads of situational questions from people who are struggling.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And Pastor John and I are honored that so many of you entrust us with some really gut-wrenching emails.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I only wish we could address them all, but we can't.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   We can address a few of them, like this question from a burned-out dad.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   He writes in anonymously.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "Pastor John, I love your work and I love how seriously you take the Bible. Thank you.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I just turned 40, married for 11 years. We have three special needs kids under 10.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Only our oldest is out of diapers. All have autism or developmental issues.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I've been a follower of Jesus for 13 years.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I'm easily sorrowful and find it impossible to be always rejoicing."
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   2 Corinthians 6:10
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   "I get so worn down, discouraged, and sometimes outright bitter and angry because as much as I love my kids,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   taking care of them is hard for me and for my wife.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I've even confessed in the past to hating my job as a father.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   How do I love my family like God wants me to, and how do I find peace and joy in all of this despite how taxing it is?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It just feels like no matter how hard I try or how much I do, I'm barely getting it all done.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I hate that I sometimes resent my kids and my wife and this life.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Now the middle-age years have arrived and I fear burnout, even of running away.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Pastor John, can you help me?"
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Yes, I think I can if God gives me grace to speak the truth and he gives you the inclination to believe whatever is true that I say,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   because I do believe God is working in you and for you.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So let me picture his work, this work that I'm saying is for you, with two images.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   One is that God has given you a walled fortress.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   The walls keep you in and keep destruction out.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   That's the first picture. I'll come back to it.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The other picture is that inside this fortress that God has mercifully given to you,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   inside this fortress where you live with your wife and your children,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   God has been, is now, and will continue to be at work omnipotently on your behalf.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So those are my two pictures.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   God has walled you in and God is working inside those walls to be for you everything you need.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So here's a brief explanation of those two pictures.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   When I say he's walled you in, I mean he has made clear the boundaries of your legitimate options in life as husband and father.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You do not have to lose sleep or spend any agonizing time trying to decide what those life boundaries are.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   These are protective walls, and one of them is you may not leave your wife, period.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   She is your wife by covenant. God was witness to this covenant.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   He has joined you together, and what God has joined, man may not put asunder.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It is a precious, protective wall keeping you in and keeping destruction out.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Second, you may not abandon your children.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   If anyone does not provide for his relatives, especially for the members of his household,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever, 1 Timothy 5, 8.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That's a wall, a precious, protective wall.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You stay in, destruction stays out.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Those are gifts.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   In fact, though in one sense they constrain, they are ultimately freeing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Just like a tightly fitted parachute constrains the upper body, and then as you jump, gives you life.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   But here's the main thing.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Inside these protective, life-giving walls where you live and struggle and feel beaten down with weariness and discouragement,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   that's where God Almighty has worked, is working, promises to work for his trusting children.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He is mightily at work, and it helps when you feel overwhelmed to have someone come alongside—
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   that's me right now—come alongside and rehearse the magnificence of God's help inside the fortresses he has built for you.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So here's a reminder, a glimpse of how God is at work in your walled-in fortress.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Here's a half a dozen things that he's doing.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Number one, before the creation of the world, God chose you for his own, his own possession and child and, yes, even treasure.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You had absolutely nothing to do with this.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You did not cause this.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You may have thought that you met some conditions somehow.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You didn't meet any conditions.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   He consulted no one but himself when he chose you.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   All of his will was the arbiter, and he chose from all eternity to set his favor in eternal love on you.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Number two, he predestined you, his chosen treasure, he predestined you to be his child conformed finally to his Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That is your destiny, your glory, a glorious soul, a glorious body, a glorious world, a glorious position at his right hand with pleasures forevermore.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   This means that his election cannot be rescinded without him becoming a liar.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   That's why predestination on top of election is so precious.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He destined, that is, he promised before the creation of the world that you would have this glorious destiny conformed to his Son.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Unless God is a liar, your election will not be rescinded.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Number three, at a point in your life, you may remember it, you may not remember it,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   at a point in your life, God called you out of spiritual darkness into life.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Just like he did Lazarus at the grave.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I don't know how it happened to you, maybe a sermon, maybe a Bible text in the quietness of your room, maybe a friend, maybe a blog.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   God opened your eyes to see the truth and the greatness and the glory of Christ.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   He made you alive.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You could see. Fourth, the Spirit of God was given to you and he gave you saving faith.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   He gave you faith. At the moment when your faith came into being, you were not the decisive influence.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   God was. It was a gift.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Number five, you are acquitted of all your sins, past, present, future.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   In the divine tribunal of heaven, your sentence for all eternity has been passed.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Not guilty. Leap for joy.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Go dancing out of the courtroom this afternoon, not because you are sinless,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   but because the sinless one bore the punishment for your sins.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Think of it. You are accepted forever by God and he is 100 percent, not 99 percent, 100 percent for you.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And if God is for you, no one and nothing can succeed against you.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Six, God poured into you his Holy Spirit in an overflowing way.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   He is present in you. He's the seal of your inheritance.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   He's the power of your heart to know and love God and people.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You are not left to yourself in this fortress of obedience.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   God is mightily present and at work by his Spirit.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Number seven, you have the hope of glory. The hope of glory.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   All your circumstances may for a season seem utterly inglorious.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I get it. I hear what you said about these kids.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   This feels inglorious. That's the way it was for Jesus.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   That's the way it will be for all the saints.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   First, the suffering. First, all the inglorious, all the ignominious dimensions of life.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Then, glory.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And I want to remind you, the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed to you.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And if you look at the context of Romans 8, 17 following, you will know those sufferings are not just the sufferings of persecution.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   They are the sufferings of everyday life by which Christians groan with all the kind of burdens you just described.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Number eight, God has given you promises in his Word, unspeakably great promises.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You are among the greatest beneficiaries in the world.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   They are among the greatest mercies in the world.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   They are new every morning.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   He has promised to strengthen you and help you and uphold you.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   He has promised to make every hardship turn for good.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   He has promised to work in you what is pleasing in his sight and to move you to walk in his statutes.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   He has promised to withhold no good thing from you.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Yes, yes, even your overwhelmed situation all comes by his good hand.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   He has promised, and I close with this, he has promised, because it touches so close and so precious on your exhausted season in life,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times you will abound in every good work.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   In other words, God will not require anything of you in this fortress that he will not give you the grace to endure and perform even with joy.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. That is touching.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And of course, with a 40-year-old dad writing this in, I have to mention that we have addressed the midlife crisis in two previous episodes,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   both of which have served a lot of guys based on the emails we've gotten.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   If that's you, if you're approaching or if you are in the midlife years, see episode 1173, "My Midlife Crisis," in Council for Yours, and also episode 1365,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "How Do I Survive This Midlife Crisis?" episodes 1173 and 1365.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   To find those episodes, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And thank you for listening along. Be sure to subscribe to APJ in your favorite podcast app or in YouTube.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Well, we have an email from a new convert who thought conversion was going to put a full stop to his pre-conversion sin patterns, especially his drug use.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Well, it hasn't. John Piper responds next time. I'm your host, Tony Ranke. We'll see you on Monday.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   (end)
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   (end)
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   (end)
