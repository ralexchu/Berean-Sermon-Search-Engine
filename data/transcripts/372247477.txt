[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello, good morning everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.240]   My name is Nathan and as I'm sure we're starting to miss Pastor Peter being up here, but would
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.280]   you continue in prayer for him as he's on his sabbatical?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.800]   And because of that, as you've known, we've been going through the book of Hebrews as
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.200]   a church.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.900]   Today as we have for the last couple of weeks, we're going to be continuing on in our covenants.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.520]   And so this is, if you're unaware of Berean members, if you want to be a member of this
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.920]   church, go through a series of classes and at the end sign off on a covenant that says
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.920]   that we're committing to certain things.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.380]   There are 10 total.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.960]   And to go into it real quick before we pray and start, covenant number one was what Pastor
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.000]   Mark preached on a few weeks back.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.960]   This is I confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.720]   That is probably the overarching covenant, like the bookend of all the covenants that
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.980]   we are assigning here.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.440]   And then last week, Pastor Peter preached on the importance of God's word and that was
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.580]   in covenants numbers two and five.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.160]   Number two was I confess that the Bible is the inerrant word of God, which has ultimate
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.900]   authority over my life.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.320]   And then covenant number five was kind of a branching off of that, I commit to attending
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   and preparing for weekday Bible studies every week to the best of my ability.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.640]   And so today, we're going to be looking at covenant number three and before we go into
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.800]   that, if you could bow your heads with me, we'll pray and go in.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.160]   Heavenly Father, again, we're very grateful to you, Lord, to be able to sing songs that
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.280]   come up out of our hearts.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.200]   Lord, we sing to you as forgiven people.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.220]   Father, we are filled with joy.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.080]   We don't look like this world because we have a hope that is not of this world.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.800]   God, thank you that we are secure.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.680]   Thank you, God, that we have a boldness and a confidence and a foundation that's unshakable.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.880]   And Lord, for all of us who have been going through difficult things, who have been struggling
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.920]   with different sins, who have been tempted even perhaps to have our eyes turn inwards,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.560]   that our eyes would draw up to you and just be grateful people.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.000]   Lord, thank you for an opportunity for us to then dive into your word.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.200]   Help us to understand you and what prayer is a little bit more after today.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.720]   Okay.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.920]   So covenant number three is a tough one because whenever you're trying to get into this idea
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.000]   of prayer and what is prayer, it's not easy.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.600]   It's not easy to define the structure, the parameter of what prayer is.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160]   It's pretty, if you want to be exhaustive about it, there's a lot of stuff to cover.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.600]   So we're not going to be exhaustive today, but to turn our eyes to the covenant, covenant
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.400]   number three says, "I commit to a life of devotion to pray regularly, interceding for
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.800]   the leadership and the members of BCC."
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.560]   And so I'm going to break that down because I think there is a bit of a connection between
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.680]   the first and second half of this covenant.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.800]   And that first half, it says, "I commit to a life of devotion."
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   I commit to a life of devotion.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.960]   I want to just define a few words because I think today's day and age, these words are
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.320]   very diluted, right?
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.540]   The word commit is pledge, devote, or dedicate.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.080]   That's what that word means.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.840]   So that's a strong word.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.240]   When we say we're committing to something, it's not just say like, "I'm just thinking
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   about it."
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.320]   You're saying, "I'm kind of putting myself in this."
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.640]   And secondly, that word devotion is, I think, even stronger.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.480]   Love, loyalty, enthusiasm for a person, activity, or cause.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   And so that has this idea of fidelity, of faithfulness, of allegiance, of this idea
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.300]   of if you've ever seen somebody play poker and they say, "All in," it's this idea where
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.160]   they're pushing everything in.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.240]   This is what it is to be a believer.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.180]   I commit to a life of devotion.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.800]   That calls to us, right, because this is what I am.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.180]   I commit to a life of devotion.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.740]   Everything gets swallowed up and swamped into this, that we are people who have submitted
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.780]   to the Lord in these things.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.940]   And so when we read his word, the natural, reflexive, and sometimes only response then
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.120]   is actually, in my opinion, it's prayer.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.780]   When you say that Jesus is Lord over my life, when you say that I submit to the Lordship
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.120]   of Christ over my life, and when we say that I will take his authoritative word and adhere
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:56.420]   to it and submit to it, the reflex, I think, is prayer.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.180]   A few things, because in Lordship, we feel the battle against the flesh.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.040]   It's a fight we cannot fight on our own within this idea of sanctification.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.940]   So we pray.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.300]   Another one is because in reading God's word, we see commands that we, it feels like we
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.080]   cannot perfectly follow these commands.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   So what happens?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.820]   Well, you gotta pray.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.180]   Thirdly, because in the spiritual battle we're engaged in, we sense our own powerlessness.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.400]   That we are incapable of doing anything to actually bring about change in the hearts
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.580]   of people around us, and actually even in our own hearts.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.580]   Have you felt that?
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.620]   Man, I can't change my heart.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.760]   Another one is because we love God.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.440]   We pray reflexively.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.160]   We long to commune with him.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.820]   God alone, he opens our eyes to this.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.320]   We aren't just soldiers in battle.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.280]   Here's the game plan, now do it.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.100]   It's not just that, it's this deep communion with the Lord.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.380]   And so we pray.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.380]   It's a reflex.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.740]   So if you, you know, reflex, I like that word because you kind of think of that little hammer
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.780]   that the doctor hits your knee.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.660]   I don't know, I feel like that happened only when I was a kid.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.100]   But when you're a kid, you're sitting there, and I remember we would be in these long lines,
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.300]   and then the doctor would one by one go and do all these tests on us in school.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.760]   And then there was always that kid, always that one kid, who would try to kick their
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.740]   legs before the hammer came down.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.460]   And the doctor would be like, "Hey, don't do that."
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.220]   It's supposed to test your reflex.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.420]   So what happens is, the hammer comes down on your knee, and what happens to your leg?
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.740]   It just goes up.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.620]   There's nobody that sits there and says like, "Oh, I guess I'm supposed to kick my knee,
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.260]   or kick my leg up."
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.700]   I think prayer is kind of like that.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.840]   It's supposed to be responsive.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.340]   Now it is a discipline, and we're going to talk about that a little bit.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.460]   But when we're living life, when we're trying to adhere to the Lordship of Christ over our
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.980]   lives, prayer is very much like that.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.900]   So a question for us then is, do we pray?
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.380]   A secondary question is, what's that look like for you?
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.000]   How has your prayer life been?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.340]   Has it been something that's been reflexive?
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.820]   Has it been something that you feel like, "This is very much a part of my life, in my
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.140]   relationship with the Lord."
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:29.900]   Upfront I'm going to say this is a tough sermon, because this isn't like false humility.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.020]   I am in no way an expert on prayer.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.540]   I know, even as going through the sermon, I was like, "Oh my goodness, how do you preach
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.540]   this?
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.780]   When this is so hard for me."
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.140]   But for all of us, I think we feel this.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:53.220]   This desire and need, and even desperation sometimes that, "Man, we have to pray more."
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.740]   And I hope that we as a church come together in this.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.780]   So to flesh out covenant number three, we're going to be all over the Bible.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.360]   And so a lot of it we're going to have up here, but you can follow along in your text
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.820]   if you'd like.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.680]   So this commitment to a life of devotion, to look into that again, I wanted to take
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.940]   a look at a series of texts, because I believe that this is where it starts.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.580]   When we commit ourselves to this life of devotion to Christ, that's where prayer begins.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.980]   And so Matthew 13, verse 44, it says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.780]   in the field, which a man found and hid again.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:32.780]   And from joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.420]   Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:41.620]   And upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.480]   it."
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.140]   So that idea of devoting yourself to something or committing to something is found in this
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.420]   verse, right?
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.300]   He sells all that he has.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.180]   This is like the Christian thing.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.140]   You see this and you go, "That's me.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.540]   That's what I did.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.540]   This is what I did a year ago when I became a Christian.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.820]   This is what I did 10 years ago when I became a Christian, 30 years ago when I became a
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.820]   Christian.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.820]   This is what I did.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.460]   I sold all that I had."
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.360]   Christians, we devote ourselves, we commit ourselves to this.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.500]   We are people that says that it's not just like I'm following on a different track of
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.400]   beliefs.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.180]   This is everything in there.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.900]   Philippians chapter 3 verse 7, "But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.860]   counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.740]   More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.860]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.660]   rubbish so that I may gain Christ."
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.740]   Everything that I thought to be dear, I count it, I consider it.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.980]   Like I sit there and I look at it and I kind of study it and look at all the angles and
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.660]   I say, "Yup, consider it loss."
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:03.820]   Galatians 2.20, "I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live, but
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.500]   Christ lives in me."
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.020]   I'm actually, I'm saying I've died to myself.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.660]   There is no devotion or commitment to self anymore.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.980]   It's completely to Christ.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.860]   2 Corinthians 5.15, "And he died for all so that they who live might no longer live for
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:27.140]   themselves, but for him who died and rose again on their behalf."
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.260]   Romans 14.8, "For if we live, we live for the Lord.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.100]   If we die, we die for the Lord.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.500]   Therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord's."
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.380]   Deuteronomy 6.5, last one, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.780]   your soul, with all your might."
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.580]   We glance over these things and we say, "Yes, I want that."
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.260]   But honestly, when you put these things on yourselves, this is what we're saying.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.500]   As a believer, we commit to a life of devotion.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.280]   If you're a believer in this room, this is something you have already said.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.100]   This is the agreement in becoming a believer.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.220]   There is no going back on this.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.420]   There is no middle ground in this.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.980]   There is no no man's land or straddling the fence.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.660]   There's no kind of half in, half out.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:19.340]   We've completely devoted our lives.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.860]   We say that we've given it to Christ.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.300]   We live for God's kingdom.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.060]   We do not build up our own kingdom anymore.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.300]   And when we take stock of our lives, if we were to sit at this moment right now and to
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.260]   look at the decisions we make and to look at the things that we do, we say we are constantly
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.020]   submitting.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.100]   We're not living for ourselves anymore.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.460]   When you see someone devoted and committed to something, there's passion there.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.140]   So while it's true that the Christian, it doesn't always mean you need to feel.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.420]   Sometimes people ask, "What does it look like to feel love for God?"
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.980]   We can go into that conversation another time.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.860]   But passion is real.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.060]   When you're devoted to something, when you're committed to something, there's something
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.860]   that has to be there.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.180]   Something that you said, "My life is all about this.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.580]   Is it possible for me to stand here and say, truthfully nod along to that while I'm standing
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.580]   here?"
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.180]   It's not.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.900]   And this kind of sounds like maybe covenant number one again, the lordship.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.900]   And it should.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.900]   It should.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.340]   They overlap.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.680]   One of the great results though of Christ's lordship over our lives and our adherence
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.180]   to his authoritative word is going to be prayer.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.500]   This is our second point.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.380]   Prayer becomes a test as to your commitment and devotion to the Lord.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.260]   I'm not saying that's why it's there.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.060]   I'm saying prayer, if you look at your prayer life, if you look at the quality and content
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:13:01.420]   of your prayer, you're going to be able to see lordship or lack thereof.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.300]   You're going to be able to see by someone's prayers, by their prayer life, whether they
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.740]   just say it, "Christ is lord over my life," or whether it's true.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.060]   Because what you pray is your heart.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.460]   See prayer reveals things.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.220]   Someone can say, "I live for God.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.820]   Christ is all I need."
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.300]   But this prayer life becomes a window into your heart.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.180]   It looks at your motives.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.500]   It looks at your true goals.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.340]   And it looks at what you really want.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.660]   What prayer, in it being revealing, I'm going to go through a series here, a series of statements.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.260]   First is how you approach prayer reveals what it shows you.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.700]   It reveals our attitude towards God.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:52.780]   I'm sorry, the formatting shrunk everything, but it's on your apps too, so you can look
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   there.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.620]   But how you approach prayer reveals our attitude towards God.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.680]   It can show you whether you treat him kind of like a genie in a bottle.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   We know that image.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.260]   An image of some God that you bow down to in order to receive something.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.740]   Your prayer life will show that, it will reveal.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.700]   Your prayer life will show you whether your religion is superstitious and you pray because
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.900]   you want to have extra blessing for the day or for some far-off God that you don't really
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.740]   know to do some miraculous work in your life and the lives of people around you.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.500]   It can also show whether we live a works-based, guilt-driven Christianity.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.020]   You can do it as a routine because this is what Christians do.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.720]   So for those of us, the bulk of our prayers, if it's done during mealtimes, we might fall
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.100]   in this category.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.540]   Prayer reveals our attitude towards life itself, whether you will pursue your own desires or
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:52.060]   God's desires, your own kingdom or God's kingdom.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.540]   If we don't pray, we're most likely self-centered.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.660]   We're not worried about the people around us.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.580]   We're not worried about God's kingdom.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:08.660]   We're supremely fascinated by our own lives and what we could do.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.020]   Leading into this one, prayer shows where we truly believe sovereignty lies.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.340]   Again, we could say, "I believe that God is in control.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.900]   I believe that he's sovereign."
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.420]   But by our prayer life, it will reveal whether you truly believe that or not.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.020]   When you run to prayer, when you turn to prayer, it will show something about your belief in
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.700]   that.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.820]   Prayer reveals an understanding of our own sin because where we see sin, it's reflexive
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.820]   to pray.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.860]   Yes, it's a command to us to submit and to obey, but I think this is always accompanied
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:46.540]   by a cry to God for help in overcoming our flesh and grateful prayers to God for sending
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.720]   Christ to have done the finished work on our behalf.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.220]   If we pray only in groups and seldom alone, it reveals the quality of our personal relationship
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.700]   with God.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.380]   If we pray alone and never in groups, it reveals the quality of our love and fellowship with
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.380]   others.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.740]   See, prayer reveals a lot of stuff in our lives.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.420]   We can agree with the concept of lordship, but what prayer does is it checks the reality
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420]   of that.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.860]   It's a reality check for us.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.780]   As people who have ... Just looking at those verses, as people who say that, "That's me,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:27.420]   that I have wholly given my life over to God," people who have expressed that we live solely
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:35.760]   for Christ alone, that all of life is about him, that my job is about him, that my relationships
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.500]   are about him, that my free time is about him, that every facet of my life, completely,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.420]   all in, devotion, is about him.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.180]   Sometimes our prayers just don't match up to that.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.340]   Tim Keller says, "To discover the real you, look at what you spend time thinking about
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.160]   when no one is looking, when nothing is forcing you to think about anything in particular.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.900]   At such moments, do your thoughts go toward God?
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.980]   You may want to be seen as a humble, unassuming person, but do you take the initiative to
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.740]   confess your sins before God?"
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.700]   By the way, that's prayer, right?
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:17.220]   "You wish to be perceived as a positive, cheerful person, but do you habitually thank God for
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.780]   everything you have and praise him for who he is?"
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.780]   That's prayer.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.540]   "You may speak a great deal about what a blessing your faith is and how you just really love
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.380]   the Lord, but if you are prayerless, is that really true?
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.220]   If you are joyful, humble, and faithful and private before God, then what you want to
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.220]   appear to be on the outside won't match what you truly are."
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:42.060]   I have come across plenty of people in my life who are well put together in the Christian
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.380]   faith and know how to articulate lots of Christian things.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:51.620]   And then, you know, there are just things that feel a little bit alarming.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.020]   And then if I were to ask an apartment maid or something like that about that person's
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.980]   prayer life, they might say, "Oh, yeah, I don't really see them doing that."
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.980]   And it could be a little scary.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.540]   See, as a Christian, you live wholly and unconditionally for the Lord.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.720]   Lordship is our confession.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.060]   The authoritative Word of God becomes our standard, the idea of a plumb line, right?
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.340]   It becomes what we adhere to and abide by.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.620]   And I think prayer becomes the natural response to that.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:28.740]   And so when you look at your prayer life, when I had to sit and just again look at my
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.900]   prayer life, it's very humbling.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.820]   This brings us into our third point, what is prayer?
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.100]   And this is actually Keller's definition.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.100]   There was a bunch.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.140]   There's so many definitions of prayer out there because in Scripture, there's no one
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.140]   definition.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.060]   And we'll talk about that a little bit, but I really like this one.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.860]   Prayer is a communicative response to the knowledge of God.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.340]   And that's a great definition for it.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.780]   Because when we think about what prayer is, some of us might think like...
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.300]   All of these are true, by the way.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.180]   Supplication, entreaties, maybe, what do you call it?
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.620]   Petitioning, like that kind of stuff, right?
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.300]   We're asking God for stuff.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.260]   That is prayer.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.500]   We might also think of it as words of thankfulness and gratitude.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.420]   That is indeed prayer.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.180]   Prayer can be adoration and worship and proclamation of His greatness.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.260]   That's prayer.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.500]   Confession of sins, that's prayer.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.980]   Communion with God, that's prayer.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.780]   And we can go into a survey of the Bible, but instead, I wanted to just look at 1 Timothy
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.580]   2, to give an example of what I'm talking about here.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.060]   1 Timothy 2, it says, "First of all, then I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.980]   and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men."
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.660]   So those four words there, entreaties, prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, this is pretty...
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.860]   Those four words are pretty much the four words used for prayer through the New Testament.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.740]   And so you'll see it all over the place.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.180]   And you'll see it in different places.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.840]   Here, Paul is saying, "I thank my God in all my remembrance of you."
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.260]   And here, you'll see someone confessing their sins.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.100]   And here, you'll see someone crying out, "Be merciful on me, like a sinner."
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.380]   You see all these different facets.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.980]   This is all prayer.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.980]   So prayer is grand in scope.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.140]   That's why there's no clear definition.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:22.460]   In Matthew 6, it's probably like the best example of prayer and the Lord's Prayer.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.020]   But it just comes down to this.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.660]   It's a communicative response to the knowledge of God.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.460]   And I want to dumb that down a little bit, because it helps me.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.860]   It's basically what that's saying, it's relational.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.040]   Prayer is very relational.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.860]   It's how you talk to someone.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.980]   And I was hesitant about this, because I didn't want to simplify it too much, because there's
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.620]   a lot of things involved in what prayer is.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.620]   But I think when you boil it down, this is the foundation of it.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.600]   The foundation is not even on the words you're speaking, necessarily.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.460]   It's actually on the person you're praying to.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.900]   It's talking to the God I love.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.020]   Prayer is communicating and expressing my desires to God.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.740]   To the God I love.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:16.220]   To the God I walk with day by day.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:29.580]   Prayer is relational in scope, because it's opening this part of me to the Lord.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.420]   We don't just long for a relationship with Him.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:38.380]   The truth of the matter is, we are in a relationship with God.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:44.220]   So have you ever been in a deep relationship with someone, and you don't communicate with
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.220]   them?
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.460]   And it becomes very like, "What am I going to do for you?
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.460]   What are you going to do for me?
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.700]   If you guys would like to schedule this and this kind of thing."
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.100]   It's that kind of thing.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.220]   Well, when communication isn't there between two people, when you don't see two people
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.260]   just kind of like, you know, like two people who really care about each other, love each
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.900]   other, they share their hearts.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.380]   If you really like enjoy being in the presence of people, you don't just do your own thing
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.420]   and then, "Oh, by the way, hey, can you like..."
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.860]   When you see people who love each other, like you go to a restaurant, you see people who
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.220]   really enjoy being in each other's presence.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.020]   What they do is they're sitting across the table and they're just pouring into each other.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:32.380]   They're just living life, talking about different things.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:39.340]   See the Christian, we love the Lord so much, we have actually said, "Everything, I've traded
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:45.820]   it because I love God that much."
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.020]   God has saved us to be in relationship with Him.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.860]   Actually when humanity sins, He distances Himself from us, right?
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.860]   And He does that.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.140]   I personally think this is great grace and mercy of God, that He would distance humanity
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.220]   away from Him because in His presence, we die.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:12.340]   So He distances us and then the whole goal of salvation is to bring us back to reconcile
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.540]   us back into a relationship with Him.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.780]   That's why believers have the privilege of approaching the throne of grace and confidence.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.940]   We have this great privilege of speaking with the Lord, having a relationship with the Lord
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.780]   and this is life.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:36.500]   Our prayer is going to reveal something about the quality of our relationship with the Lord.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.860]   See in Lordship, it's easy to get stuck on one side of the coin, on what I need to give
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.500]   up, what I need to submit and bow my knee to.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.580]   We get stuck on that.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.820]   But the emphasis of our faith is not so much on what you're giving up.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:00.220]   The emphasis is not on the fact that you have to give up your whole lives.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.140]   The emphasis is not on the fact that we need to die to ourselves.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.860]   The emphasis is actually on what we gain in Christ.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.140]   And in light of what we gain, when we gain the clarity of sight to see what it is that
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.300]   is being offered to us, we gladly lay down our lives and surrender and submission.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:23.060]   So to look at those passages again, in Matthew 13, 44, the highlight before was on the kingdom
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.060]   of heaven is like a treasure.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.620]   I'm sorry, before we say he goes and sells all that he has, but the highlight should
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:34.940]   be on that first part, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field.
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.900]   If we get so fixated on the fact that I need to give up my life, that I need to sell everything
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.380]   I have, man, that's a miserable existence, isn't it?
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.940]   But when we look and we see the kingdom of heaven is a treasure, it changes things.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:56.980]   In Philippians, it should go from like, I've counted as lost, it's for the sake of Christ.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:02.800]   The surpassing value of knowing Christ so that I may gain Christ.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.700]   In Galatians 2, 20, it shouldn't be I have been crucified with Christ, it's no longer
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.100]   I who live.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.460]   I really think it should be, but Christ lives in me.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:17.460]   The life, I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.460]   gave himself up for me.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.340]   Second Corinthians 5, 15, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves,
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.900]   but the emphasis, but for him who died and rose again on their behalf.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.700]   In Romans 14, 8, not so much on we die for the Lord, therefore whether we live or die,
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.540]   I think it's just we are the Lord's.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.780]   We don't walk around saying, what have I given up for the Lord?
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.180]   We walk around saying, oh, I love God.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.760]   Prayer is supremely relational because we are brought into a relationship with the God
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   that we now claim to love with all of our hearts.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.320]   He is the reason we live.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.040]   He is life itself to us.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.300]   He will say, take away everything I have.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:11.180]   All I have is Christ.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:18.780]   In relationship then with the Lord, there are times when you're just grateful and thankful.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.820]   You're just thankful.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.900]   What happens in relationship?
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   You say thank you.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.740]   I say this to my daughter.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.320]   If you're thankful, say thank you.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.380]   In relationship with the Lord, there are times when you feel sorrow and grief over having
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.380]   hurt someone.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380]   What do you do?
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.220]   You say sorry.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.220]   You repent.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.020]   You confess.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.660]   In relationship with the Lord, out of our love for the Lord and our view and sight of
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:50.860]   who he is, we can't help but shower him with compliments, right?
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:58.180]   God, you're so good.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:05.780]   We can't help but lift up words of adoration to him, praise.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.580]   In relationship with the Lord, we constantly come across our desire and need.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.460]   So what happens?
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.460]   We ask God.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.900]   See, prayer, I don't think is as complicated as we make it seem.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:23.020]   If we love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, as it says in Deuteronomy
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.480]   6.5.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:31.440]   If that's the case, then prayer happens.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.940]   This is what happens in relationship.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:39.560]   Now, I said I had a daughter, Addy.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.760]   Every Monday, I drop her off and pick her up from school.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.360]   Then I love picking her up from school because that's the only day of the week I can pick
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   her up from school.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.640]   So, I pick her up.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.720]   We have our little habit.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.320]   What we do is we sit down for lunch.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.680]   Then as we eat, we ask her questions.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.960]   We say, "Oh, how's your day?
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   What did you do?
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.640]   Who did you play with?
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.480]   What did the teacher say?
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   What did you eat?"
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   All that stuff.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.680]   Addy will sit there and she will talk our ears off.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.280]   Sometimes I'm like, "Why did I ask?"
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.600]   But she talks and talks and talks.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.400]   She's like, "Oh, Bella did this and Mason did this and the teacher said this.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.320]   We had water play today."
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.640]   We got to eat a cupcake because it was this person's birthday.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.840]   You know, honestly speaking, even though sometimes it gets on my nerves after a while, I sit
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.840]   there and it's just like, "Oh, I love this.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   I love that my daughter just talks."
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.960]   Three weeks ago, oh man.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.500]   Three weeks ago, it still breaks my heart thinking about it.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.500]   We sat down.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.720]   I said, "Addy, what did you do today?
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.980]   How was your day?"
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.760]   She looked up and then she looked back down at her food and she said, "Daddy, you already
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.760]   know."
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.200]   I just looked over at my wife.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.080]   I looked over at Kezia and we just stared at each other like, "What was that?
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.800]   This little four-year-old girl."
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.440]   I was like, I turned to her.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.520]   I almost wanted to discipline her right there.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.800]   "Tell me what you did today."
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.560]   But you know, it's not that.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.820]   There's something about that reaction where she didn't want to communicate with me.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:27.840]   It's like this is my child that I love with all my heart.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.580]   It felt like she looked at me and said, "I don't love you."
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.620]   I'm being all dramatic right now.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.260]   I'm not a dramatic person.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.300]   I have a pretty thick skin and stuff.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:44.100]   But seriously, I'm like, I wanted to yell at her face like, "Love me."
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.860]   I know.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.060]   I know what she did.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.020]   I have her whole calendar.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.020]   The teacher gives us a calendar that says this is what they do during the day.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.500]   I know that there's a snack time and I know that's her favorite time.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.540]   I know who her best friends are and she played tag again.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.500]   I know all this stuff about Addy.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   I do.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.900]   But I don't care.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.080]   I long for a relationship with her.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.100]   And I think about my prayer life and I think about God.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.940]   And again, it's not about getting all touchy-feely here.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:26.060]   But sometimes I wonder if we just need to take a step back and think, "I wonder how
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.060]   God feels.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:40.100]   I wonder how do I come off before the Lord in prayer?"
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   It's very strange.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.540]   Am I making God feel like that?
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.780]   I wonder.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:57.980]   My time of prayer that I've set here in this time of day and in this part of life and here,
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.820]   I'll do it.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:06.380]   But I wonder if God is looking down and saying, "I just want to be in a relationship with
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.420]   you."
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.220]   Prayer isn't the straight jacket that we're in that says, "Here's the prescription
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.220]   to pray."
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:21.260]   I love it when Addy talks to me just out of the overflow of her heart because it just
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.940]   shows she loves me.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.940]   She cares.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.940]   She wants to talk to me.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:31.620]   And sometimes I wonder if you could simplify prayer to God just wanting to talk.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.100]   And so in talking, I'll teach her.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.820]   I'll correct her.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.540]   I'll say yes or no to things.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:47.260]   But in life, this is part of us coming together in relationship and our wills start to weirdly
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.260]   align.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.820]   We start to get to know each other.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.220]   She knows what I'll say yes to, what I'll say no to.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.580]   There's a lot that happens there.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:03.260]   And where it might be sterile, I could give her a list of things to do and not to do.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.500]   Like, "Here's our rules for the home.
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.500]   Follow it."
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:11.180]   When we're in communion, when we're talking, when we're sharing, all this kind of stuff,
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:16.900]   when that happens is when the weight of who I am and who she is really comes together.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:26.100]   And law, if you're going to think about it that way, law becomes so much, so an intimate,
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.100]   relational, loving type of thing.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:35.700]   It's not sterile.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:43.620]   The Christian, when we think about our prayer life, when we say, "God, I love you with all
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.540]   my heart.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:52.900]   I have given up my whole life for you," and then we have a hard time praying, there's
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.740]   something disconnected there.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.660]   And this is why this was so challenging for me.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.660]   J.I.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:08.060]   Packer says, "Knowing God is a matter of personal dealing.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.460]   Knowing God is more than knowing about him.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:15.260]   It is a matter of dealing with him as he opens to you and being dealt with by him.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.780]   Friends open their hearts to each other by what they say and do.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.660]   We must not lose sight of the fact that knowing God is an emotional relationship as well as
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:29.740]   an intellectual and volitional one and could not indeed be a deep relationship."
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.220]   If we understand, even theology, God is omnipresent.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.740]   He's everywhere.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:43.100]   In a relationship with him, what happens is as we go through the day, prayer happens.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.860]   When we lack in prayer, many times because we forget he's there, he's invisible to us.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.300]   But look at what it says about the Christian in 1 Peter 1.8.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:54.460]   It says, "Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:59.740]   And though you do not see him now but believe in him, you greatly rejoice with joy and express
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.540]   the bone full of glory."
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.780]   Prayer is actually an obvious thing that happens when we keep the invisible God in spiritual
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.500]   sight and we're walking with him.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.980]   We're remaining in relationship with him.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:20.420]   This brings us kind of drawing into our fourth point.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.660]   You must know the word of God in order to properly pray to God.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.660]   That's our fourth point.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:29.820]   You must know the word of God in order to properly pray to God.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.620]   Because this is the challenging question for us.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.980]   Again, how is your prayer life?
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.820]   What does it show about your relationship with the Lord?
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.860]   Your prayer reveals whether we know who he is.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   We have a hard time praying.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:48.220]   It's like trying to talk to someone that you don't know too well.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   Sometimes it's hard.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.500]   I mean, even praise and prayer nights.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:57.220]   We're praying these long little parts of prayer and maybe we're starting to come across this
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:04.900]   little tension of like, "Man, why is prayer just so hard?"
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.900]   Prayer being relational.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.620]   You pray to God and you communicate to him.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.260]   But in order for you to be able to continue circularly in communication, if it is relational,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.460]   then something needs to come back, right?
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.940]   And that's the word of God.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.060]   There is no other way for you to be able to know who he is if this is a knowing relationship
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:28.580]   other than through his word and what his word verifies in your surroundings.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.420]   The word of God is God's words to us.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.340]   We're living and active.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.060]   And then the Holy Spirit, what the Holy Spirit does, comes and communicates the word of God
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.900]   to us.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.460]   The word of God responds to us in every situation in life.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.260]   It's kind of cool.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.260]   I'll give an example.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.260]   Psalm 13.1.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.260]   This is a Psalm of David.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:53.340]   And he says, "How long, O Lord, will you forget me forever?
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.300]   How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.580]   How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart all the day?
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.380]   How long will my enemy be exalted over me?"
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:08.500]   See, this is just, there is no Bible there, right?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   Be careful how you think that one.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.220]   But there is no Bible there.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.940]   If you look at it, it's just someone, he's just kind of pouring out his heart to the
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940]   Lord.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940]   "Where are you?
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.620]   Is this going to go on forever?"
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.620]   He's just communicating.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.300]   And in Psalm 13.3, it says, "Consider and answer me, O Lord my God.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.100]   Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death, and my enemy will say I have overcome
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.100]   him, and my adversaries will rejoice when I'm shaken."
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.660]   But here's where the knowing of God thing kind of comes back.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.660]   And he begins to speak.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.660]   The Word of God speaks back into our prayers.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.940]   He says, "But I have trusted in your lovingkindness.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.900]   My heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.100]   I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me."
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.320]   You can see here how David interacts with God.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.700]   He prays, and then he tells truths of who God is.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   And then he prays again.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.140]   And it comes back and forth, back and forth.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.700]   This is what it is to walk with the Lord.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:05.060]   I think it's wholly on word and prayer.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.460]   We pray, and we're like, "We don't know what to pray."
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.020]   Well, it's because we don't know the Word of God.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.380]   We don't know what God is trying to say.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.820]   It's because we don't know the Word of God.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.500]   We can't expect to pray into thin air and say, "Oh, there it is.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.620]   He put it in my mind, what I'm called to do."
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.500]   He has already revealed it.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.180]   A theological term for this is the great previousness of God's Word.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:28.940]   That somehow, even though it was written thousands of years ago, that today, when I'm living
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.140]   my life, God is speaking to me through it.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.440]   Fresh, in my circumstance.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.180]   The Word flows into prayer.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.820]   The prayer flows back into the Word, and on, and on, and on.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.980]   And that's why the Bible says that there are kind of...
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.980]   There might be more, but there are two things that are unceasing.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.300]   You probably know where I'm going with this.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.120]   In Joshua 1, verse 8, it says, "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth,
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.900]   but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.260]   to all that is written in it."
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.500]   The interesting thing about this is we look at it and we say, "Okay, I got to read the
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.740]   Bible day and night."
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.660]   But it's very interesting because he says, "This book of the law shall not depart from
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.900]   your mouth."
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.980]   And the idea is to meditate on it day and night.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:18.560]   And so there's this unceasing thing kind of accompanying the Word.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.540]   But the other one is 1 Thessalonians, chapter 5, verse 16 through 18, Paul says, "Rejoice
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.780]   and pray without ceasing, and in everything give thanks, for this is God's will for you
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.900]   in Christ Jesus."
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.140]   He says prayer is also an unceasing thing.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:37.180]   In Ephesians 6, 18, it says, "With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit,
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.020]   and with this, in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.020]   saints."
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.700]   See, Paul, he never ceases praying for the Philippians, right?
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.700]   You remember that?
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.940]   Like, "I never cease in my prayers, in my remembrance of you."
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.460]   He says, "I am praying for you constantly," right?
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.100]   And so there's this idea of the Word of God being something we need to meditate on constantly,
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.320]   and then there's this idea of prayer needing to be unceasing, and then there's us looking
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.500]   at these two things, and we say, "But really, how do you pray all day?"
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.460]   And so we start doing gymnastics.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.500]   "Well, this is what he must really mean."
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.860]   And without having to go too far into that conversation, I think God sometimes looks
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:24.540]   at us doing that exercise and says, "Dude, just...
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.540]   Can we just love each other?"
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.980]   Like, "It's just...
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:37.380]   Let's talk and listen to me."
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:41.180]   Eugene Peterson says this, "Left to ourselves, we will pray to some God who speaks what we
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.260]   like hearing, or to the part of God we manage to understand.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.980]   But what is critical is that we speak to the God who speaks to us, and to everything that
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.220]   he speaks to us."
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.140]   So this is talking about the importance of that Word of God, right?
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.660]   The Bible cannot be taken apart from this.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.860]   There is a difference between praying to an unknown God whom we hope to discover in our
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.500]   praying and praying to a known God revealed through Israel and Jesus Christ who speaks
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.580]   our language.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.500]   In the first, we indulge our appetite for religious fulfillment.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.720]   In the second, we practice obedient faith.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.300]   The first is a lot more fun.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.180]   The second is a lot more important.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.620]   What is essential in prayer is not that we learn to express ourselves, but that we learn
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.960]   to answer God.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.020]   And there's that cycle.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.100]   It's not just that we're just pouring out our heart and that's it.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.100]   "Oh, great.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.580]   God, thank you for being my therapist today."
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.820]   It's that we come and he desires to speak to us.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.820]   Have you ever had that friend?
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:35.020]   I think we've all had that friend before who comes and just uses you as a...
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.020]   Just uses you.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.020]   I'll end it there.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.580]   They'll say all their troubles.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   "Woo, thanks, man.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.580]   That was good.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.580]   All right.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.580]   All right, see you next week.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.580]   Same time, same place."
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.580]   And it just takes off.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.980]   And those people, you just get so tired.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   You get very tired.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   But we do that to God.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   We say, "Here it is.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   Here's my request.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   Here's my stuff."
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.980]   He says, "All right, see you, God.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:55.980]   See you.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.980]   Same time, same place tomorrow."
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:03.480]   No, God speaks to us through his word.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.580]   It is a back and forth.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:10.700]   And so if we come to know God as described in scripture, if we are not making a God of
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:17.300]   our own image, of our own creation, then what happens is our prayers become awesome.
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.980]   I like to think about it that way.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.180]   Our prayers become awesome.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:25.060]   Because the more we know about God, the more our will begins to align with God.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.180]   And so, I just listed out a couple.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.300]   We start praying for God's kingdom and not our own.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.540]   Because the more we come to know God, man, we love him.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.660]   We know what God is all about.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:39.380]   So we just start to like, it just happens.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.900]   We'll pray small and detailed because we know who God is.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.460]   We know God cares for the little thing, that he cares for the details, he cares for all
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.340]   these minute stuff.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.700]   And so when we pray, we start praying like that.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.300]   Because that's who God is.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:02.500]   When we pray, our prayers become almost like, scandalously big.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   It becomes big.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.060]   Our prayers become really big.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.060]   Like, wow.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.140]   You have the gall to pray for that?
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.140]   Like, really?
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.980]   You pray that that man to be saved?
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.500]   Well, yeah.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.420]   I believe that God is more powerful.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.940]   I believe that the word of God is like hammer that can shatter stone.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.420]   And so, yeah, I'm gonna pray that.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.740]   I'm gonna watch difficulty fall on their life.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.820]   I'm gonna see them cry out to God.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.340]   And I'm going to see salvation happen in that place because I know that's what God desires.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:42.740]   And so everything about our understanding of who God is, it comes out in prayer.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.180]   We're gonna skip this next part.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.260]   I listed out five things here that you can kind of look up.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.420]   They're kind of just little nuggets of advice.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:57.580]   But just to kind of conclude the sermon, what we're trying to do here in this covenant,
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.860]   we're saying we're committing to a life of devotion.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.860]   That we live for God, that we submit to his Lordship, and we submit to the authority of
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.860]   God's word.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.860]   And so here we are at covenant three.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.660]   And at covenant three, we're saying, well, we need to pray.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.980]   And what we've been saying today during the sermon is that your prayer life is going to
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.380]   reveal something about your true devotion to the Lord.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.500]   Whether it's this religious activity that you do and that you've just become really
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.900]   good at hanging out with Christian people, talking about Christian things, versus someone
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.500]   who says, "Oh, man, I know God."
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.740]   You know when you come across these types of people.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.300]   Like, wow.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.020]   Those are the people you leave and you just feel fire under you, right?
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.020]   You know it.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.300]   You know when you connect with someone on that God level.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.700]   Because these people just love God.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:49.380]   And so if that's the case, then I think that we really need to commit to this.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.740]   We need to be a church that prays.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.420]   Ask anyone around this area, everyone's gonna be like, "What's Berean like?
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.420]   What do they hold?"
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.460]   Word of God.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.180]   And praise the Lord for that.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:08.140]   Praise the Lord that we hold a high view of God's Word.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.940]   But I pray more that we submit to it.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.460]   And in submitting to it, that we become people who pray.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:21.560]   I wish, this is my secret wish, that when people wonder what's Berean like, I wish not
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:26.860]   only that, but it accompanies with, "Boy, they pray a lot."
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:31.820]   That's what I wish.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.860]   That we constantly, it says up here, that we constantly pray for the leadership.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.540]   Would you do that?
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.180]   Would you pray for the leadership?
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.900]   More than kind words, more than acts of service, would you pray?
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:49.980]   Like, a prayer is seriously greater than, we won't go into it.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.420]   We constantly pray for one another when we're talking to each other.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.260]   When we hear of how difficult circumstances are going, man, sometimes I love going up
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.940]   to that cafe on Sundays because I see people praying.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.700]   I love that.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:09.180]   And my hope is, it becomes so a part of who we are individually, that it's something that
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.180]   just happens.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.740]   I see people praying here together, after service and stuff.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.940]   I know something more serious must have been going on in life for them to be praying like
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:19.940]   that.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.380]   I hope even in our fellowship, that it's not one of those things that brings the party
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.380]   to a screeching halt.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.820]   It's like, "Ehh," when someone says, "Hey, you guys want to pray?"
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.700]   But that it's natural that we come together and we're like, "Hey, let's pray."
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.980]   And everyone's excited for that.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.180]   That there's no better activity we can be doing than that.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.140]   That we understand the urgency of prayer.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:47.580]   We couldn't get into the theology of all this, but the urgency of the fact that we must pray
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.940]   in order to drive the church.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:57.380]   That it shows that we are truly incapable, that we are truly powerless to change anything.
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.700]   In anything in our lives.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.900]   Small, big.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.900]   I can't make my next breath happen.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.860]   We're just constantly praying because it shows that we are in great need and desperation
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:14.180]   for God, and there is that great awareness of this that needs to be saturated and pervading
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.980]   through our church.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.060]   We need to pray.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:27.260]   So please, set times of prayer in your life where you will devote that time to prayer
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.360]   and make it the best part of your day.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.260]   And then, through the day, commune with God.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.820]   Pray as you go.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.940]   Just say, sometimes it's okay to just say, "God, thank you."
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.940]   That's okay.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:44.020]   It could be simple in that.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.820]   Also learn to pray in groups.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:50.260]   And I think this is just a plug.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.420]   There are things going on at church.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.620]   There are plenty of opportunities that we would give.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.700]   And some of the more recent ones.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.920]   There's a prayer, a men's prayer meeting that's going on in a couple Saturdays.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.620]   And I hope that every XY chromosome in this room is there.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:10.660]   I hope that we fill that room with people who are just like, "Man."
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.460]   Men who want to pray.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:16.380]   If we have a church of men who don't pray, man, we're in trouble.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.380]   I hope.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:22.540]   I'm really excited for that prayer time because I hope when we come in, it's just like, just
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.380]   by everybody being there, we're like, "Oh, yes.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.380]   This is good."
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.100]   8.30 a.m. every Sunday.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:34.220]   Yes, you can take your time a little bit more at home or you can say, "I will serve the
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.220]   church in prayer."
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.220]   Right?
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.220]   "I will come."
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.220]   8.30.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.100]   Kind of like the way we would think a parking minister, a cleaning minister.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.460]   This is how I serve the Lord.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.860]   You can come and say, "I will devote that time."
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.220]   There is no better activity sometimes you can do than prayer.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:53.020]   I would rather see a trash on the ground right there, or sorry, yeah, than someone not praying
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.020]   because they're picking up the trash.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.140]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.100]   Hopefully you pick up the trash and then pray.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.580]   But all in all, what we want is we want people to understand the importance and the gravity
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.460]   of this is not simply important.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.540]   This is vital.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.540]   This is crucial.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.540]   Right?
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.540]   Okay.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.980]   And also, we have praise and prayer nights once a month.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.300]   Hope you're aware of that.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.980]   And during those praise and prayers, I actually do get very encouraged.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.940]   This room does fill in pretty good.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.500]   But I hope no matter what season of life you're in, no matter how crazy life is, no matter
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:31.260]   how tough the week was, you see prayer as not just something like, "Oh, I guess I should
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.260]   go."
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.060]   But you look at that night, you circle it, you calendar it in, and you're just counting
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.620]   down the days because praying together is sweet.
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:45.100]   I love praying next to people on Friday night praise and prayers.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.540]   It's really hard to pray back there in the cry room, but man, sometimes when I'm out
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.940]   here and I'm just praying with everybody, it helps.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.940]   And so all in all, all this to say, this is the covenant that we sign as Koreans.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.260]   I commit to a life of devotion, to pray regularly, interceding for the leadership and the members
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.260]   of BCC.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:13.220]   Would you bow your heads with me in prayer?
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:20.900]   Heavenly Father, would you help us and would you allow us to remember that this is not
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:26.220]   just a call to pray because of guilt, that we haven't been doing it enough, but Father,
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.460]   that we would come not to the symptom, but to the core root.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.220]   God, are we walking with you?
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:38.740]   Can we honestly say we love you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength?
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.780]   And instead of letting this become such a big gap, "Oh, I'll never get there.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.980]   How can I ever adhere to that standard?"
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.580]   And then starting to bring that standard down.
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:52.260]   I pray, Father, instead that our eyes would just be very simple.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:58.980]   We would place it upon the Christ that died for us, that rose again, that offers us life,
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:05.060]   that we would place our eyes on you, our creator, the sustainer, the holy one.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.780]   Father, you truly are the best.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.660]   God, you are awesome.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:22.740]   God, there is no one, nobody, nothing like you.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:30.220]   And Father, I pray that you would help us to stop placing our eyes on different things,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.540]   that it would pollute our prayers.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:38.500]   So Father, as we go into a time of response now, would you help us to pray?
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.620]   Would you help us to pray right?
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:45.720]   Would you help us to pray in accordance to who you are and what we know you to be?
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.820]   And so help us, God, to pray for your kingdom come, your will be done.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.580]   Instead of using prayer as an avenue to make my kingdom come and my will be done.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.920]   So thank you, Lord.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.140]   Let prayers ring in this room.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.740]   And Father, let every member here, as they go out to the different places in Orange County
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:07.380]   or wherever it is, that we would be people who are marked by prayer.
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.660]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.060]   Amen.
