[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   Hello, my name is David.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.200]   I'm a post-grad in BAM Ministry and this is my testimony.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.680]   Growing in faith has been a lifelong journey.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.960]   During my childhood, I was blessed to be raised in a Christian household and have the opportunity
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.480]   to begin to hear about God at a young age.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.520]   My parents were active in church and served in many roles.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.400]   My father attended seminary and became a pastor with his own ministry.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.780]   I volunteered, served, and was involved in church in ways that seemed to grow my faith.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.020]   I checked off a lot of boxes as a Christian living in Southern California.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.440]   In reality, I had not even met God and wasn't pursuing His kingdom with all my heart.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.720]   My focus was always advancing my earthly goals and aspirations.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.600]   In my mind, I thought I was walking and living for God and that God was helping me carry
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   out my plan.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.880]   However, I was actually living for myself and mistakenly believing that I could glorify
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.960]   God with my selective obedience.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.920]   I lived as if I was king of my own life and I did what was right in my own eyes.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.800]   At best, I was obeying only some of God's commands.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.520]   While in grad school, my eyes were opened to how fragile this world is and how incredibly
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.320]   shallow my faith was.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.080]   I was surrounded by brilliant individuals who were driven and willing to sacrifice every
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.600]   moment to advance their careers, lives, and their own names.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.720]   I also sought after these things and continued to mistakenly believe that I was doing all
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.560]   this for God.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.760]   I thought that I could give more to God by pursuing my own interests, even though that
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.840]   was far from the truth.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.600]   I was still attending church and serving in various roles, but was really wandering away
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.440]   from the presence of God.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.080]   At best, I was obeying most of God's commands.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.160]   While wandering away from the presence of God, my soul became troubled because I knew
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.600]   the example that Jesus had set for me.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.840]   I became so preoccupied with my own life that I couldn't possibly live for God.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.960]   After grad school and coming home to California, I entered into a spiritual desert and recognized
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.840]   I did not have a genuine relationship with Him.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.540]   No matter how much I prayed, read the Word, and attended church, I couldn't enter His
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.880]   presence simply because I could not become righteous by my own efforts.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.360]   Through His mercy and grace, all the things I had placed my hope and trust in fell one
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.640]   by one.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.520]   Only after I became sick and tired of living for my own life did I understand that His
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.240]   love is greater than anything I could ever comprehend.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.960]   By grace, He allowed me to begin to understand when He said, "For my thoughts are not your
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   thoughts, nor are your ways my ways," and that "to obey is better than sacrifice, and
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   to heed is better than the fat of rams."
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.120]   By grace, He showed me that He is Almighty God and that He shares His glory with no one.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.240]   By grace, God allowed me to understand how to seek after Him with all my heart, and only
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480]   then did He finally meet with me.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   By grace, He invited me to seek Him and gave me the privilege of possibly comprehending
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.920]   His love and goodness.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.680]   In God's own brilliant way, He called me to build my life upon the foundation of faith
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   and His righteousness.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.000]   I have learned that for me, there is no prioritizing God over things of this world, and that there
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.960]   is only God's truth and nothing else.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   Through Christ's sacrifice, I am able to be with God, and I have been crucified with
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.080]   Christ and it is now Christ who lives in me.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.520]   I can place my trust and hope in Jesus, who made a way back to God, and walk by faith,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.760]   believing that slowly but surely, I am becoming the man God has called me to be.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.360]   Thanks to Jesus' sacrifice, I can live a life where my joy, peace, and rest is in His
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   word and presence, and I look forward to a life of repentance, perseverance, belief
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.520]   in the power of Christ's sacrifice, making God king, and giving my very best to obey
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.760]   not some, not most, but all of God's commands.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Thank you.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   [Applause]
