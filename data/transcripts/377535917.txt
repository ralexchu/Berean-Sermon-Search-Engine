[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Okay, good morning.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Morning.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Morning.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Did you have your readers this morning?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   Okay.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.600]   I have the privilege of sharing God's Word with you this morning and I have to say that
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.560]   I haven't done this in a while, coming up and preaching.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.360]   And I really do appreciate in preparing this message.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.000]   I really do appreciate our pastors, I just want to say that because to come every Sunday
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.880]   to do this day, week in and week out, and to provide and provide good, expositive, you
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.000]   know, messages every week is hard to do.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.680]   I can attest to that.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.520]   It was a labor for me, just because, you know, what do you say and everything that goes with
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   it.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.800]   But in any case, this morning I hope that some of this, that being prepared, that it
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.080]   was led by the Spirit and that in the end, you know, I feel inadequate up here to preach
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   the Word of God.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.960]   You know, I have to admit to you that, you know, when the thought of coming up and preaching,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.360]   there's a flesh that comes in and I want to entertain you guys so that you would like
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.960]   me, you know, like my message and I get praised.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.800]   But I realize that is wrong and that's something that, you know, I have to fight with in myself
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.400]   in doing that.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600]   So again, I really appreciate our pastors.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   I know that they come and serve the church humbly and to come and preach up here is definitely
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.000]   a service to the church.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   So I want to give props to our pastors, even our elders, you know, props to you guys.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.360]   They're great men of God.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.600]   I really admire them and see their love for the Lord and by challenge of them.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   So I will start.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.280]   I've been tasked to review the fourth membership covenant, which states, "I commit to attending
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.400]   Sunday worship at BCC to the best of my ability."
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   So if you think about it, all around the world, Christians are gathered on Sunday, like us,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.080]   to give worship to God.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   According to Wikipedia, so take it for what it is and I'm not saying it's accurate, but
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.520]   I think just to give a kind of a general idea, the number of people who are gathering on
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   Sunday.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.800]   There are 800 to a billion Protestant Christians around the world.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.560]   If broken down by region, it would look like 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 260 million
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.480]   in Americas, 140 million in Asia Pacific, 100 million in Europe, and only 2 million
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.140]   in mid-north Africa.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.240]   So obviously gathering on Sunday is an important Christian tradition, but like any tradition,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.720]   it can be just that, a tradition.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.960]   We come to church because we have always come to church.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.720]   When I was young, before I became a Christian, I told myself that once I grew up that I would
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.160]   not attend church anymore.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:28.120]   And the reason for that is because my father is pastor, as most of you know, and as a result,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.960]   I was attending church all the time, right?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.520]   Since I was born, even before I was born in my mother's womb, I was attending church service.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   So church attendance for me was just something that I had to do.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.160]   Mostly in America, we went to a small church.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.240]   So basically it was our family and maybe an elder's family, so the youth group was very
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.600]   small, not too much like the way we started here at Berean, right?
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.720]   So I told myself that I wasn't going to go because I didn't see the purpose behind it.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.280]   I didn't see the reason behind going.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.120]   It didn't make sense to me because it meant nothing to me other than it was a tradition,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.160]   something that I did, something that I had to do on Sunday mornings.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.120]   So in the membership covenant, when it says I commit to attending Sunday worship, it means
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.520]   more than just being at church physically.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.920]   It means that we are committing to attendance, but also committing to understanding the reason
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.780]   for gathering together.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.000]   Why do we gather on Sunday and not Saturday?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.920]   The Sabbath day, doesn't the Ten Commandments say that we are to observe the Sabbath day?
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.800]   Exodus 28 says, "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.980]   Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath."
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.200]   Why do we sing songs and hear messages?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.360]   Why do we gather as a congregation and not at home alone?
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.620]   So I'll try to address these questions in some part today.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.840]   So at some point when Pastor Peter returns, so we're going to talk about Hebrews, right?
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.200]   It might take a year or maybe longer or maybe shorter, that he will be expositing Hebrews
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.800]   10, the passage I'll be spotting and talk about.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.300]   So consider this as a shadow of what is to come.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.420]   A better preacher, a better message is coming.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.520]   So he's coming back.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   Okay, so he is coming back.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   So let's begin by a word of prayer before we begin the message.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.360]   Let's pray.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.320]   Dear Heavenly Father, I just want to thank you, Lord God, for this morning as we gather
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.040]   together.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.640]   We are not alone in gathering here, but we have millions and millions of other Protestant
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.480]   Christians, Lord God, coming together to give worship to you, recognizing and proclaiming
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.960]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that we proclaim who you are and what you've done
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.360]   on the cross.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   We gather together for our own benefit as well, Lord, because we need that you called
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.960]   us, Lord God, as people of worship, Lord God, that we were made to worship you.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.200]   So as we gather together this morning, that you would be with your servant, who is definitely
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.040]   inadequate to speak this message this morning, but I pray, Father, that you would work through
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.600]   the preparation and that we would all be blessed this morning, Lord God, by your word.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.080]   I want to thank you, Lord, and entrust the time to you.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.760]   In Jesus' name I pray.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   Amen.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.280]   So as a reminder, Hebrew is written to second or third generation Jewish believers who are
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.800]   thinking of going back to the old covenant ways and its sacrificial system.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.120]   The book of Hebrews is an encouragement and a warning.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.600]   An encouragement to those who are being persecuted to persevere, because there was severe persecution
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.240]   going on, some because of the persecution, was falling back.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.720]   This is also, the book of Hebrews is also a warning to those who are drifting and who
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.880]   have neglected the great salvation they have received.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.560]   They have forgotten the greatness of Christ's death and sacrifice on the cross and started
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.040]   to embrace the shadow instead of the real.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.360]   The warning of drifting is a warning that is so relevant to us today, right?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.340]   There's so much distraction around us, especially this time of the year, right?
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.720]   We just got through Thanksgiving.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.760]   Black Friday doesn't start on Friday anymore, right?
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.960]   It starts on Thursday, Thursday night.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.440]   Black Friday is not enough, so we have Cyber Monday.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.960]   Some of you are getting ready to do your Christmas shopping at work, right?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.320]   So this is also a big movie time, a lot of big bluster movies, because people are spending
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.760]   money.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.440]   So the last Star Wars is coming out, right?
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.320]   The final trilogy before another one is made, right?
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.560]   You have Disney+ that came out, the streaming service, free seven-day trial.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   I got sucked into that, right?
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   A lot of the parents, right?
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.580]   We got to see some Disney movies this holiday.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.560]   So if you're a sports fan, right, we have sports galore.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   You have the college football championships, you know, coming together.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.120]   Who's going to play in the final four?
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.960]   NFL playoffs, right?
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:46.240]   Now football is becoming more, because the championships are coming, the playoffs are
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.720]   coming, right?
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.240]   And then some of you who play fantasy football, right?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   The end is coming, you're going to win that championship, the little prize that you get,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.360]   I guess, to say you're better than your friends.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.600]   Lakers versus Clippers are coming this Christmas Day.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.360]   I'm actually excited, right?
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.500]   Lakers finally, for a long time, is relevant.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   Looking forward to that.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.920]   It's a great time of the year to be a sports fan, right?
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.320]   And people are traveling to see family or going on vacation.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.080]   If you love to ski, right, you're looking for that storm like we had and waiting to
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.040]   go up and put on your skis and hit the slopes.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.760]   And I can go on and on and on, and there's nothing wrong with any of this.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.440]   However, they are all distractions, and if we are not careful, these things can cause
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.080]   us to drift.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.520]   That's why are you not glad that in the sea of distractions that once a week we set aside
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.100]   Sunday to gather at the body of Christ to sing songs, hear God's Word, and fellowship
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.820]   with other believers.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:58.220]   It's a day of rest for us.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.700]   So Elder Joe read the passage this morning, but I'd like to focus first on the first two
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.140]   verses of Hebrews 10, 19 and 20.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:14.460]   "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:21.260]   by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil that is his flesh."
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.420]   So when we see the phrase, "since we have confidence to enter the holy place," it reminds
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.620]   the reader of Hebrews chapter 4 about entering his rest.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:38.140]   And Pastor Peter preached the sermon on Hebrews chapter 4, 1 through 10 about this rest in
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.700]   July, and it was very deep in theology.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:50.020]   I hope many of you were blessed, and I commend you to continue to review that message, because
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.780]   it's rich and blesses the content really a blessing.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:01.740]   So this, the Hebrews chapter 4 is a reference to Genesis chapter 2, the rest, right, that
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.580]   occurred in creation.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.740]   God in six days created the heavens and the earth, all of its worth, right?
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.820]   In Genesis 31, just before chapter 2, God makes all creation, he says, "it was very
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.820]   good."
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.460]   He looked at his creation, he said, "it was very good."
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:28.060]   And he set aside the seventh day to rest, and he blessed it and set it aside as being
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.460]   holy, right, as being holy.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:41.740]   But because of the fall, as Pastor Peter preached, because of the fall, the rest became restlessness.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.340]   So the command of observing the Sabbath is given to the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.860]   through Moses.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.100]   Sabbath, the word Sabbath doesn't come on in Genesis chapter 2.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.380]   It first comes up in Exodus when the law is being given.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:06.740]   So we see the connection of the Sabbath and of Jesus Christ, right, when the law is given,
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.180]   the law is given to observe the Sabbath.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:19.580]   So we see that the rest that is talked about in the Sabbath rest, the rest that is in Genesis
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.860]   chapter 2, is the rest that comes only through Jesus Christ.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.500]   Matthew 11, 28 to 30, it says, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, I will
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.900]   give you rest.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.660]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:42.740]   find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.380]   I just want to make one statement here, that I gave my outline, and since I gave my outline,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.900]   all the verses are there, but I might have moved it around, okay.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.500]   So I know somebody who follows along, okay, don't get freaked out, okay, if somehow the
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.820]   passages are moved around.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:03.980]   Alright, so just in general the passages are there, don't freak out, but just hear the
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.900]   word, okay.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.420]   So the Sabbath, like our Sunday, was a day of rest for the nation of Israel, but it was
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.020]   anything but rest, right.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:21.260]   Jesus is a rest, and because of the sin, there was restlessness in man.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:28.380]   So Sabbath Sunday, although the command is to rest, there was no real rest for the nation
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.380]   of Israel.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.340]   So under the old covenant with Israel, the Sabbath day was extremely strict.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.900]   Not only was no work to be done by the Israelites and their children, they also were to give
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:46.600]   rest to all their household servants, livestock, even sojourners, right, sojourners, so visitors.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:53.280]   So if you think about it, if you're livestock and you're slaves and no one is to work, and
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.760]   think about the livelihood.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:02.320]   For these people, this is their livelihood, that to take a break and to do no work is
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.080]   not easy, if you think about it.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.320]   Because I'm pretty sure they're thinking about, "Oh, who's going to feed this, who's going
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.360]   to do that, how are we going to take care of this?"
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.400]   Maybe some of you who are busy at work, that's what you're thinking about.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   Even though it's vacation, you can't take a break because there's work to do.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.600]   So I liken this maybe to Chick-fil-A, that they close on Sunday.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.520]   It's not an easy thing to do, but they do it and God has blessed them for it.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.400]   So it's not easy to rest when there still is work to do.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.360]   So God even gave regulatory laws over what could and could not be done.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:44.640]   For example, if one even went out to gather sticks on the Sabbath in order to kindle fire,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.520]   he was to be put to death.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:53.060]   So you're in the desert, it's cold, you need to warm up, you want to go out and you want
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.060]   to grab sticks.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.880]   Well, there was a guy who did that.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.680]   He worked on the Sabbath and he was put to death.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.320]   It seems very extreme.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.560]   That was the old covenant.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.800]   And I used to work for an Arab Jew when I was in college, and I remember coming to work
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.080]   on Saturday and he happened to show up.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.680]   He said, "I normally don't work on Saturday because it's the Sabbath."
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.040]   But he said, "Oh, I'm a bad Jew."
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   And I said, "Why?
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.280]   Why do you call yourself a bad Jew?"
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.080]   And he said, "Well, you know, on the Sabbath there's about over 600 things I'm not supposed
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   to do."
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.280]   So I said, "Okay, of the 600, how many do you comply with?"
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.080]   He said, "Two.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   That's it.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.680]   Not working on Saturday and maybe not eating meat on a particular day."
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.840]   So it's hard to do.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.600]   There's all these regulations, right?
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.560]   Even though it was commanded to rest, there was no real rest.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.880]   If Israel was commanded to rest on the Sabbath, but they could not because of all the laws
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:16:00.960]   and regulations they had to observe, and the penalty if they did not, so in the end, what
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.360]   was the purpose of the Sabbath?
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.200]   So that takes us to our first point in the sermon, which is that the Sabbath was a reminder
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.320]   to Israel that sin separated man from God.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:23.800]   And there's nothing more illustrative of this fact than the Day of Atonement.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.960]   So the Day of Atonement was a central point of the book of Leviticus.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.200]   How do we know that?
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.400]   And during our Bible study on Leviticus, some of you are part of that, some of you are not,
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.160]   we learned that Leviticus is written in what's called a chiastic structure.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.200]   And what the chiastic structure is, you kind of bookend, or you can kind of see it as a
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.600]   pyramid, that you start off and there's another bookend, and in the middle of another bookend
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:58.120]   there's a parallel passage, and in the end, the central point that does not have a parallel
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.000]   passage in the book is the main point.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.520]   And that's how the book of Leviticus is divided.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:15.080]   So the ritual ceremonies are discussed in chapter 1 through 7, as well as 23 to 27,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:23.640]   then priesthood 8 to 10, 21 to 22, purity 11 to 15, and 10 to 20.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.480]   So it's kind of bookending.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:32.320]   And then chapter 16, the Day of Atonement, is the only chapter there is no parallel to.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   There's no parallel.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:43.840]   So you see that the main point of the book of Leviticus is this day in chapter 16.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.080]   So I don't want to spend too much time on this, but as a reminder of what we learned,
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.640]   I have some pictures to help us, I hope, to visualize the tabernacle, if that's up, if
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   not.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.080]   Okay, there you go.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   So that was the tabernacle.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.960]   Can I get to the next one?
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:06.320]   All right, so this is how the tabernacle is set up.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.200]   So you have the altar, burnt incense, and the laver where they wash up.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.440]   And then as soon as you go into the first tent in the Tent of Meeting, that's the holy
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   place.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:26.320]   And then behind the second room is the Holy of Holies, where the Ark of the Covenant and
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.200]   the Mercy Seat is.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.960]   That symbolizes the presence of God.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.120]   So on the Day of Atonement, when it's talking about entering, and even the Hebrews, about
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:41.360]   entering his holy place, that is what it's talking about, being able to enter that room,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.060]   in the presence of God.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:52.440]   So to get an idea what Israel had to do, so now in Leviticus, that talks about the law,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:19:00.120]   the ceremonial religious law, and chapter 16 being the main focus, and the center, let
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.680]   me quickly go through what the high priest had to do.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.880]   Because the high priest is the only one, once a year, who's able to enter in that room.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:18.680]   And even when he enters, he has no confidence that he's going to survive because of the
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.800]   separation between God and man because of sin.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:30.360]   So the high priest, first of all, is to take a bowl and sacrifice it for his own sin, and
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.240]   even before that he had to prepare himself by washing, and also putting a special robe
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.400]   on.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:44.520]   So once he gets a bowl and gives a sin offering for the sins of himself and for his family,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:51.600]   he's also to take a censer full of coals, a fire from the altar, two handfuls of sweet
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.080]   incense, beat in small and bring it inside the veil, so he would go inside the veil,
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.060]   put it on the fire before the Lord, so the smoke is rising.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:07.440]   He has to do that so that when the presence of God is there, that he is not killed, because
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.280]   he's not to view the face of God, right?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.960]   Because he is so holy.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.640]   So he has to do that for his own safety, basically.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.560]   And all this is done to cover the mercy seat, right?
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:26.520]   He takes the blood and he sprinkles it, the smoke is there, right?
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:32.000]   And then blood of the bowl is sprinkled with his fingers from the mercy seat on front of
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.540]   the east side seven times.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:41.360]   See how intricate and accurate it is that if he does not follow the letter of the law,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.560]   then his life is in danger.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.840]   And after that, he would take two goats, take them to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.920]   that's just before you get into the holy place.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:59.280]   Lots are cast to see which goat is chosen to be the goat for the Lord.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.080]   That's the one that's sacrificed for the sin, right, for the sins of the nation of Israel.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:10.520]   The other one is chosen as a scapegoat, specifically to Azazel.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.160]   And the one that the law fell to the Lord is used for all for sin offering.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.320]   And the same thing is done, the blood is taken, sprinkled, right, as the high priest did for
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.440]   his own, the blood of bowls.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.640]   He does that for the blood with the goat, right?
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:36.040]   Then afterwards, then he would take the scapegoat and pray over or put his hand over the goat
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:42.560]   and speak the sins of the nation of Israel, and then after that they would release it
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:51.720]   outside the camp, symbolizing sin being taken away from the nation, sin being atoned for.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:59.440]   And then in chapter, and then at the end, 29 to 34, it kind of summarizes the point
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.840]   and the purpose of the day of atonement.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:10.040]   So in Leviticus 16, 29 to 31, this is what it says, read that, "This shall be a permanent
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.600]   statute for you in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.920]   You shall humble your souls and not do any work, whether the native or the alien who
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.120]   sojourns among you.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.080]   For it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.620]   You will be clean from all your sins before the Lord.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.600]   It is to be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, that you may humble your souls.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.520]   It is a permanent statute."
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:45.280]   So in the summary of the day of atonement, it is a call, it is called the day of affliction,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   suffering in a sense.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.760]   It is a day to be cleansed from their sin, for the sins to then, but it doesn't cover
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.620]   ongoing sins.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.040]   It is a Sabbath of also a solemn rest, right?
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:04.960]   And also, you see the word Sabbath here, it was a solemn rest of remembrance.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:11.080]   So in the scripture, the Sabbath always looked back to the original creation.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.600]   So if you think about it, at this point, especially on the day of atonement, looking back to the
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.680]   creation, Genesis chapter 2, and the rest God gave, right, commanded on the seventh
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:28.640]   day to rest, it really is a reminder of the fall, because they lost the communion, right?
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.640]   Adam and Eve had communion with God.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.000]   There was no reason to sacrifice animals to come before him, to come near to him, draw
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.200]   to him, but now because of the fall, Sabbath has become a reminder of what had happened.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   It also is a foreshadowing, right, of the coming Messiah who will restore them to the
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.000]   original state that they were, they had with the Lord.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.600]   That is why in Hebrews 10 it says, "For the law, since it has only a shadow of the good
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   things to come, and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:14.000]   offer continually, year by year, make perfect those who draw near."
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.280]   So the whole purpose of the day of atonement was the ability for sinful Israel to be drawn
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:27.960]   near to God, and only the high priest is able to do it once a year, only after killing a
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:35.760]   bull, taking its blood for his own sins and his family, and also killing a goat, and spreading
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:43.060]   the blood, and cleansing, and atoning for the nation of Israel, then he could enter,
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:48.840]   not in confidence, but in fear, because if he did not follow every part of the law, he
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.080]   was going to be killed.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.960]   And that is to the extent Israel could have a relationship with God, right, other than
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.680]   the law itself.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.240]   So but in this day was repeated over and over and over, it was a perpetual covenant with
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.480]   God that they were to do this every year.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   So if the atonement is a reminder of sins to cover the sins that they've committed,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.160]   and if you have to do this every year, what does that say?
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.680]   It means that it's inadequate, right, that we continue, that sin is always in our lives,
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.160]   that we are sinners, so that's why it is a shadow of what was to come, which was Jesus
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.840]   Christ.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.000]   So the sacrifices of animals and all the ceremony system was a shadow of what was to come, which
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.820]   is Jesus Christ.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.600]   The yearly ritual of the Day of Atonement could not make perfect those who came near.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:50.200]   The curtain was closed for them, they could not enter God's rest by the Old Testament
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.940]   sacrificial system.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:59.200]   They could not enter God's rest by the Old Testament sacrificial system.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.680]   If it could make perfect those who come near, then there would have been no need for more
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   sacrifices.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.020]   It would have been it.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:13.400]   But it was a continual, continual ceremony, continual thing that they had to do.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.220]   And because it could not, the Day of Atonement and the Sabbath was a reminder of sins year
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.360]   by year, that is why Christ had to come.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.320]   So next point.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.680]   So Jesus inaugurated a new and living way.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:38.100]   Jesus inaugurated a new and living way because the old system was inadequate.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.400]   So it was a foreshadow of coming Christ.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.860]   So when Hebrew writer says he takes away the first in order to establish the second, he's
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.620]   not saying that Jesus nullifies or abolishes the Old Covenant.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:59.020]   And that might be maybe the thought that you have, or we might have, but that is not the
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.460]   case.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.740]   Even though the law brought death, but the intent of the law was good.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.220]   But because of the sin in man, it only brought to light the sin in us.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   And Romans discusses that, right?
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:19.700]   The law was there to bring about the sin in us because we were sinners.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:25.340]   So Jesus said, because he was criticized, are you coming to abolish the law?
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.660]   But this is what Jesus says in Matthew 5, 17 to 18.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.140]   Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.340]   I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.700]   For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.540]   shall pass from the law until all is accomplished.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.180]   So God was going to establish a new covenant through Jesus Christ, a covenant that is not
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:57.300]   about rules and regulation, but one where the law is fulfilled in us because it is written
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.220]   in our hearts.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:09.060]   In Jeremiah 31, 33, this is after the nation of Israel is taken, right, sacked by the Babylonian
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.060]   Empire.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:16.600]   The temple is destroyed and God prophesies through Jeremiah and this is what he says.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.220]   But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.680]   because of the Lord.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.620]   I will put my law within them and on their heart I will write it and I will be their
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.380]   God and they shall be my people.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:35.540]   They will not teach again each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know the
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.220]   Lord, for they will all know me.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.260]   From the least of them to the greatest of them, declares the Lord, for I will forgive
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.200]   their iniquity and their sin I will remember no more.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:56.940]   Sin and judgment, God prophesies mercy, God prophesies redemption.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:03.260]   By one offering, Jesus Christ perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:10.140]   What the continual yearly sacrifice that was done on the day of atonement could not do
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.860]   what Jesus by his one sacrifice paid, the price for sins and purchased forgiveness of
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.280]   sin.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.020]   So also the Sabbath was a shadow of what was to come.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:27.680]   So once Christ came, the true and living rest, Pastor Peter talked about the true and living
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.220]   rest that he was the rest.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.540]   Observance of the Sabbath was no longer needed.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:43.120]   So once Christ came, he fulfilled the law as a result, he fulfilled the requirement
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:49.060]   of the Sabbath, then we are no longer under the Sabbath, right?
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.060]   Sabbath law.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:56.220]   So in Colossians 2.16 says, Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:02.020]   or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day, things which are
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:08.440]   a mere shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.340]   This is why we do not meet on the last day of the week, like the seventh day Adventists
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.700]   do because Jesus fulfilled the Sabbath in himself.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:26.620]   So this brings us to our next point, why Christians have service on Sunday and not Saturday.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:34.220]   So the point is, and I put an exclamation when he is alive, I wanted to scream and put
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   the emphasis because how important it is, right?
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.060]   This is the excitement of coming together on Sunday.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:49.180]   We have to think about what happened on Sunday that those Jews who are meeting together,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:58.460]   right, religiously, literally, on Saturday change their service and gathering to Sunday.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.620]   So one of the problems with the old covenant priesthood was that the high priest would
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.140]   die because they were human beings, right?
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:12.500]   Their days were numbered, and I love the way the Hebrew writer puts it in Hebrews 7.23.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:18.380]   The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.580]   by death from continuing.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:30.180]   Hebrew says we have a greater priest because the high priest died and as a result could
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:39.580]   not continue as a result of death, but instead we have Jesus Christ who lives forever.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:48.460]   So the fact that he was resurrected tells us that he is able to save for eternity, which
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:54.300]   the high priest in the old covenant system was not able to do.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.220]   So because he lives, he is able to save us.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.700]   Put it another way, if Jesus was not resurrected from the grave, we would still bear the guilt
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.700]   and penalty of our sins.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:14.260]   So we gather to worship on Sunday because Jesus was resurrected on Sunday.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:20.900]   Let's turn to Luke 24, examine the greatness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, okay?
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:33.780]   On Luke 24, "But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.620]   the spices which they had prepared.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:42.660]   And they found the stone rolled away for the tomb, but when they entered, they did not
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.140]   find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:50.940]   While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.940]   clothing.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:57.940]   And as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.740]   them, 'Why do you seek the living one among the dead?
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.500]   He is not here, but he has risen.'"
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:15.340]   Right, on Easter we gather together to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ because of
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.340]   its significance.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:21.780]   So I want to quote John MacArthur on this passage and what he says about it.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:27.580]   "Very early in the morning that the Lord is risen and he is alive, which means that he
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.180]   has accomplished redemption on the cross.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:37.500]   He has been raised for our justification, he has conquered sin and death and hell.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.820]   He has borne our sins in his own body on the cross, been made sin for us, and he has risen
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.260]   from the dead in triumph."
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:52.100]   Second Corinthians 520, "He who knew no sin became sin for us so that we might become
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.100]   the righteousness of God."
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:03.020]   The day of resurrection is why we gather on Sunday to celebrate the greatness of Jesus
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:11.580]   Christ because everything that the old covenant symbolized, the shadow, was realized on the
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.300]   day of resurrection.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.980]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the single most important event in history.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.980]   Think about it.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.980]   The world denies it, that it ever happened.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.980]   But you know what?
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:30.980]   It is our testimony and the testimony of the church, of the living God, that confirms his
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.980]   resurrection.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:39.260]   Jesus is risen and now sits at the right hand of God because his work has been completed.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.940]   There's no more work to do and that is the symbolism of somebody who sits down.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.700]   The priest had to continually work because there's so much sin, there's so much work
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:59.100]   to do in sacrifices, covering up sin, but Jesus Christ by his one sacrifice finished.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.020]   So when he was crucified, what did he say?
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.580]   It is finished.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:13.980]   So every time the church gathers on Sunday, we proclaim the resurrection of Christ to
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.380]   the world.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.580]   So at the beginning of the message, I've read somewhere, not at the beginning, but I've
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.900]   read somewhere that some people say that we worship on Sunday because it was kind of a
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.620]   counter to a pagan holiday.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:35.900]   But instead, there's evidence to show that the early believers, early Christians, started
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.760]   gathering on Sunday and not on Saturday.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.780]   So this was happening soon as the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:51.400]   So in Acts 27, it says, "On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:57.780]   to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.060]   the message until midnight."
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:04.620]   So this is the story where Paul on his third missionary journey is traveling through and
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:11.980]   he is gathering together at Troas, I believe, and then it says, "On the first day of the
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:16.740]   week they're meeting because his message was so long there was a guy who dropped and he
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.340]   died, right, fell off the window, he brought him back to life."
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.260]   But that shows that they were gathering on the first day.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.180]   And this was, you know, Paul by this time was ministering, what, 20, 30, 40 years in
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.020]   ministry by this time.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:36.660]   In 1 Corinthians 16, 1 to 2, "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:42.540]   the churches of Galatia, so do you also on the first day of every week.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:47.780]   Each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, that no collections be
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.740]   made when I come."
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.260]   So it makes sense if you're going to collect, right?
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:58.220]   Paul was collecting money for poor churches, mainly in Jerusalem, and he says, "When you
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.700]   gather on the first day of the week," which is Sunday, "collect."
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.300]   So they were gathering on Sunday, the first day of the week.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.940]   And also in Acts 2, 1-4, this is about the Pentecost, it says, "When the day of Pentecost
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.700]   had come, they were all together in one place."
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.940]   And the day of Pentecost is when the Spirit is given, right?
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:24.380]   Jesus said, you know, "Stay," Acts 1a, "until the Spirit has come upon you and given you
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.740]   power."
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.860]   So Pentecost means 50.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:34.820]   So it's 50 days from the start, the Sabbath, of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:41.220]   So if you go seven weeks, that will take you to 49 days, rest of another Sabbath, so one
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.900]   more day after that is a Sunday.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.540]   So we see that they were gathering on Sunday.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.140]   So gathering on Sunday is not a random occurrence.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:57.360]   We gather on Sunday to proclaim the resurrection of Jesus and all that it symbolizes.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:04.140]   We gather for our own purposes as well, for our own encouragement.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.580]   So what about the question, "Why do I have to come to church to have service with other
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.580]   people?"
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.380]   Okay, we could have it on Sunday, but why with other people?
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.980]   Why can't I do it at home by myself as long as I am doing it on Sunday?
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.940]   If this is you, this type of attitude is contrary to the teaching of Scripture.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:28.300]   Let me ask you this question, do you have a personal relationship with Jesus or do you
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.180]   have a corporate relationship with Jesus?
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   And before you answer it, in other words, if you do not have a relationship with the
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:44.660]   Church of Jesus Christ, then you do not have a relationship with Jesus because it is so
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:49.940]   integral that our relationship with Jesus, that it is through the Church, right?
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:58.700]   When we are baptized into Christ, we are baptized into His body, His Church.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.480]   And this is what the Bible teaches us.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:08.420]   So this brings us to the next point, that is that Jesus called us to a gathering.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.100]   That Jesus called us to a gathering.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:19.980]   In 1 Peter 2, 4, 5, and 9, it says, "As you come to Him, a living stone, rejected by men,
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.740]   but in the sight of God, chosen and precious.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:28.780]   You yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house."
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:37.300]   So we as the Church are being built up because the door is open now for those who are elect,
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:44.620]   those who do not know Him yet, can come into the Church and be built up to be a holy priesthood,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.700]   to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:55.460]   Verse 9, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.060]   own possession.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:03.220]   So very precious to our Lord, for what purpose that you may proclaim the excellencies of
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:08.860]   Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:14.980]   So when He called us, He called us to the body, right, which is being built up, the
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.980]   Church.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   So the definition of the Church is, the word itself is ecclesia, right?
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:28.820]   And ecclesia means a gathering of citizens called out from their home into some public
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.140]   place, an assembly.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:41.100]   So the fact that we are a Church means that it's a place of gathering of believers.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.340]   And Paul's letters were written to local churches in a particular region.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.220]   It says, you know, "To the church of Philippi," or "To the church of," it doesn't mean to
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:55.780]   the universal church, but it's the church gathering in a particular location.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:05.100]   So we are called as believers to worship and express our calling in the local church setting,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.720]   to gather.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:13.520]   So we are the body of Christ, so we are baptized into His body, and we are members of His body.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:22.100]   So in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, 12 to 13, "For just as the body is one and has many
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.560]   members and all the members of the body, though many are one body, so it is with Christ.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:35.760]   For in one spirit we were all baptized into one body, Jews or Greeks, slaves or free,
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.320]   and all were made to drink of one spirit."
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.880]   So some are a pinky, some are a hand, some are other parts of His body, but we are all
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.280]   essential.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:54.120]   And I love what Pastor Mark talked about and said, that we are like pillars, that we are
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   essential.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:01.800]   So when you do not come to church, it makes a difference.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.480]   So what about, I'll come to church on Sunday with other people, some I don't like, but
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.820]   I'll do it, but I'm just going to be an observer.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.920]   I'm going to come on Sunday, I'll commit to that, but I'm just going to come and be an
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   observer.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.080]   Are we to be just an observer in the church?
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.560]   Obviously you know the answer, that is no.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.800]   So the next point is that God expects us to live out our Christian lives in the local
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.960]   community.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.320]   So we are to proclaim the excellencies of Him, right, who called us, and we are to do
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:43.720]   it in the local body, the local community.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:53.200]   So verse 25, focusing on verse 25, it says, "Not to neglect to meet together," this is
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:59.920]   reference to the local church, as we gather as a local church, "not to neglect meeting
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.920]   together."
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:06.400]   So we are baptized into the universal church, but our membership in the body of Christ is
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.520]   expressed in the local church, right?
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.480]   So for us it is at Borean Community Church, it is in the local church that we exercise
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:23.640]   our gifts for the edification of the body.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.580]   So I hope all this does not sound like an obligation, that I have to come every Sunday,
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:35.800]   I have to miss important events like vacation or other commitments, because I'm committed
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.600]   to church.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:45.840]   Sunday was given to us as a gift, and let us think that way when we come on Sundays.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.800]   I am encouraged every Sunday when I am at church with fellow believers.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.680]   Throughout the week, even Bible study is different.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:01.400]   I feel like when we come on Sunday, that I am personally encouraged, when I am of the
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:08.560]   right mindset and heart and know what this day represents, on Sunday, that I am always
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.120]   filled and encouraged.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:21.600]   That Sunday is for our benefit, that you think that it's a gift for our encouragement, because
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.400]   the last point, we were made for corporate worship.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:32.680]   Think about it, we were made for corporate worship.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:40.440]   Read Hebrews chapter 12 and just set this up.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:48.040]   This is a comparison between Mount Sinai, where the law was given to the nation of Israel.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.440]   This is a description of God and the people's reaction to God's presence when they drew
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.680]   near to him at Mount Sinai, representing the old covenant.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.760]   And this is what it says, "For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, and
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:08.600]   to a blazing fire, and to darkness, and gloom, and whirlwind, and to the blast of a trumpet,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:14.840]   and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.440]   word be spoken to them.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:25.640]   For they could not bear the command, if even a beast said, 'I am full of fear and trembling.'"
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:29.260]   This was the old covenant, this was their Sabbath.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:37.160]   The Sabbath under the law was not rest, but a reminder of sins, of the fall, and of judgment.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.800]   In Christ, we are under a new covenant of grace.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:47.240]   The original rest Adam and Eve had in the Garden of Eden has been restored in Christ
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:53.200]   through, though not fully, until we either die or after Christ returns.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.400]   Now the contrast drawing near to God at Mount Sinai to drawing near to God at Mount Zion,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:06.760]   the city of God, is this, "But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:13.600]   God, to heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the General Assembly and Church
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.800]   of the Firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven and to God, the Judge of all, and to the Spirit
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:27.120]   of the Righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant."
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.280]   The picture here is the entire church is gathered in heaven.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:37.600]   God is there, Jesus is there, myriads of angels, believers who have passed away and now are
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.940]   in heaven.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:44.040]   The church is still growing, we are being built up.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:50.520]   So I shared at the start of this message that there are 800 million to about a billion Protestants
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   gathering on Sunday, giving praise to God.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:59.600]   This does not include the myriad and myriads of angels and those believers who have gone
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:07.640]   before us, gathered together on Sunday, worshiping and celebrating what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.720]   Think about it.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:14.580]   We only see ourselves here, but on this day, there are millions of people on earth that
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.340]   are worshiping God.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:24.400]   But not only that, heaven is stirred, that the angels and the elders, in the presence
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:32.480]   of God and Jesus, is also worshiping with us, that we are called to worship.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:40.260]   That Sunday is not a day that is just a day, but it's a day that represents the resurrection
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:46.080]   of Jesus Christ and all that it represents, that we are proclaiming His resurrection when
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:53.580]   we gather, that we are not the only ones praising and lifting up our voices, but there are millions
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:48:02.760]   of other Christians, as well as heaven, angels are proclaiming worship to God.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.500]   And this is what Martin Luther says about corporate worship.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:11.840]   At home in my own house there is no warmth or vigor in me, but in the church when the
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:17.860]   multitude is gathered together, a fire is kindled in my heart and it breaks its way
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.960]   through.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:29.400]   We are made to worship, that Sunday is for our benefit, because we are made to worship
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.040]   our heavenly Father who created us.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:39.540]   So if we are not gathering and not worshiping together, then we are missing something in
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.960]   our walk with the Lord.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.320]   We are members of Christ's body, which is growing and being built up.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.500]   Once all the elect are gathered, Christ will return.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.280]   So in Revelations, I'm almost at the end, here's a depiction of what worship will be
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.440]   like in heaven.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   We'll read this together.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:06.920]   If this does not get you excited and juiced up, you don't want to be in heaven, because
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.400]   this is what we are going to do.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.820]   Sunday gathering is the closest thing to heaven, if you really think about it, that we get
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.320]   on earth.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.400]   When we are saved, the whole idea of here and not yet.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:32.200]   So here we experience and taste the flavor of being in heaven, as we gather together,
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:38.520]   until the fullness is realized in Jesus Christ when he returns.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:44.120]   So Revelations 5, 11-14, "Then I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:50.080]   throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.660]   and thousands of thousands, basically probably a sea of heads.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:01.640]   And there is no end, saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:07.980]   power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing and every created
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:13.460]   thing which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:20.060]   in them I heard saying, 'To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:27.660]   honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.'"
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:33.460]   So Sunday worship is the closest thing to a taste of heaven that we will get.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:39.100]   At the man's prayer or man's breakfast list prayer meeting, okay, although we ate very
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:47.500]   well thanks to our loving sisters, I shared my experience at my first Shepherds Conference.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:51.260]   You know, Shepherds Conference is held at Grace Community Church and it's really for
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.260]   pastors and elders.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.940]   So I don't think, you know, women, okay, don't get offended, but I don't think women generally
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:02.860]   are not to be at the main service because it's for pastors, for men.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:10.220]   So I was there for the first time and I think it holds about 3,000 or more people and we
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.220]   were praising.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:14.820]   Everybody was standing up.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:20.380]   These were old men, you know, you look at me, I'm old, right?
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.380]   They were older than me.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.440]   They were old guys.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:31.980]   They were pastors who have ministered, right, in ministry, suffered for years, persevered.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.680]   Some of them probably pastored larger churches.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.900]   Some of them pastoring small churches.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:42.520]   Some of them are struggling because, you know, ministry is tough.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:50.200]   But 3,000 men who have experienced personal relationship with God, know Him in an intimate
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.660]   way because they walked the walk, were gathered together and singing a song.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.020]   I think it was just a piano.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:00.460]   There was no guitar, no drums.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:07.860]   It was just a piano and you hear the voices of this men, 3,000, singing a hymn.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:13.540]   And I have to say my soul was so filled, so filled.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:20.780]   It was like a buffet for my spiritual soul when hearing them.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:27.260]   And to me that looked like the closest thing to heaven that I would experience.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:34.420]   I was in awe because I knew that every one of those pastors, every one of those men,
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.340]   when they were singing, they meant it.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:42.240]   They were not here just clapping because there's something on the screen and they got to say
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.060]   it and somebody next to them is looking, so they got to do it, right?
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.260]   Instead they didn't care.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.500]   They were looking and they were thinking of Jesus.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.620]   They're thinking of the time when they are going to be in heaven and see Him face to
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:01.180]   face and praising Him.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:09.380]   So our Sunday worship is a time that we can experience heaven, taste of heaven.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.140]   But it really depends what your attitude is, right?
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:19.220]   If you come to Sunday worship because you're dragged here, you had a bad morning or that
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:24.820]   the night before you did something you weren't supposed to do, you feel very guilty in coming,
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:30.340]   burdened by sin, you slept, you know, you didn't sleep all night.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.820]   You know, if it was for studying for your finals, that's one thing, but it was for something
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.580]   else, you feel guilty.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:45.260]   How can you experience the benefit and the grace and the mercy and the love and all that
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:52.860]   resurrection of Jesus Christ means to us on Sunday, right?
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:58.380]   So I come to the end of my message.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:04.380]   It would be great if I could just end here, we are all encouraged, but there's also a
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:10.420]   part where we have to talk about the application of this.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.700]   What does it mean, right?
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:19.100]   I'm going through the covenant, the fourth covenant that I commit to coming Sunday service
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:24.740]   at BCC to the best of my ability.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:32.280]   So looking at verse 25 of Hebrews chapter 10, so when the Hebrew writer was writing
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:38.200]   this letter, I wonder if he paused at verse 25, I wonder if he paused there and was thinking
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:45.020]   to himself, okay, I'm going to call out some people, but do I need to do it?
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.220]   Do I really need to do it?
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.300]   Do I need to point out the sins of others?
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:55:01.060]   And I feel the same way because in calling out some of the, you know, some of, you know,
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:07.820]   maybe the deficiencies, you know, no one wants to do it, but I realized it needs to be done.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:15.580]   So I am going to address a couple of issues that one, regarding the idea or the question
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.620]   of do I have to come to Sunday every Sunday?
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:20.380]   Do I have to come every Sunday?
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:26.840]   And the other is in a general sense and also a couple of specific things.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:32.240]   In a general sense regarding coming and committing to coming on Sunday, you know, I can't come
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.380]   because of this or that.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:39.800]   It's hard to say, okay, on this you can, on this you can't, this is not good or not.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.640]   But if you look at verse 25, it is calling out those people who, it says, not forsaking
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.440]   our own assembly together as is the habit of some.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:57.380]   So the word habit here, in other, the same Greek word in other passages, it means custom,
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.380]   right?
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.180]   It means custom.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:06.260]   So here is a group of people who are not gathering, who are neglecting to gather, and it had become
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.880]   a habit, right?
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:14.780]   So I say to those that a habit is something that is done on a regular basis, that there
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:25.460]   are some who regularly miss the Sunday service and it does not, you know, pass you by or
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.460]   it's nothing.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:35.460]   So that is the people who Hebrews 25 is talking about, that if missing Bible studies or Sunday
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:40.540]   service is a regular thing in your life, that when people look at you, they almost assume,
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:48.740]   okay, I can't rely on this person because I know he's very non-committed to this, then
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:54.840]   this passage is calling you out and that you are in danger of drifting.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.940]   If that is a regular pattern in your life.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:56:59.940]   So that's a general sentence.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:06.180]   A more specific sense is we have live streaming.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:11.800]   We have live streaming that happens and we do it for the convenience of people who cannot
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:18.100]   come to Sunday service, who cannot come here physically just because you're sick, you're
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.100]   injured.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:24.880]   This year, I had my gallbladder removed and I could not come to Sunday service.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:29.400]   So streaming it was a great benefit, right?
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.920]   It was great that I could sit.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:37.720]   But I think just looking at the rise of the number of people who are streaming, that maybe
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:44.880]   it's becoming a little too relaxed for some people that you could come but because either
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:49.160]   you're tired or that you are for other reasons.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:57.000]   For you, I am saying you are missing out on coming because on Sunday, we are made to gather
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.340]   and worship.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:03.080]   And being here is different than being even sitting somewhere else.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   I know that it can easily be a habit of, you know, if your child is sick, to have both
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.080]   parents, right?
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:15.240]   Go out, but that's why I said to the best of your ability, right?
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.960]   To the best of your ability.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   To call out specifically, it's going to seem very legalistic, but it is an attitude of
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.040]   coming, an attitude of understanding.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:31.680]   I said the idea of we commit to Sunday service is that we are committing to understanding
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:37.240]   what Sunday is about and then give it the props that it deserves, that as members that
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:42.520]   we are giving Sunday worship all the props that it deserves, right?
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:48.840]   He said the world looks at the resurrection of Jesus Christ and they don't believe it,
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:53.640]   but it is the church gathering on Sunday is the one who's proclaiming it.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:59.400]   So if you are not here, you're missing out on corporate worship, missing out on the blessing,
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.060]   taste of heaven.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:07.200]   So I encourage you to the best of your ability that you attend as much, as best as you can
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:11.520]   Sunday service.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:17.080]   I hope that doesn't bum you out, but with that, let me pray and we'll end our service.
