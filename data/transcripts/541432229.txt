[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   So we're going to be reading verses 1, 2, and 3, but we'll most likely spend most of
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.120]   our time today in verse 1.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.240]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.920]   Initially I prepared a two-part message, but it looks like it might turn into a three-part
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.920]   message.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   So I'm going to finish my sermon.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.680]   So verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.440]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.040]   aside every encumbrance and a sin which so easily entangles us.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.040]   Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.760]   author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.840]   the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.320]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you will
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560]   not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.520]   Let's pray.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.600]   Heavenly Father, we pray for grace, we pray for guidance, we pray for your word to come
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.200]   alive to us.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.740]   Whatever it is, Lord God, that we have wrestled with this week, I pray that you would allow
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.600]   your word to enlighten us.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   Allow us to see a glimpse of who you are, that we may hear from you and your children,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.440]   hear your voice, and follow you and you alone.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.800]   May this time be a time of sanctification and glorification for your name.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.440]   All right, so we are finally making a transition from chapter 11 to chapter 12.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.400]   And if you notice, chapter 12, verse 1, begins with the word "therefore."
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.320]   And so "therefore," whenever you see that in the Bible, is very significant because
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.920]   it's connecting or concluding a thought that was started in the previous chapter.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   But this "therefore" is not just any "therefore."
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.360]   This "therefore" not only connects it to chapter 11, which is the immediate context,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.280]   it really is a connection to all of 11 chapters.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.000]   And so there's a big shift that happens between chapter 11 and chapter 12.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.760]   So what happens in chapter 12 to chapter 13 is a conclusion of what he's been saying in
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.240]   the 11 chapters.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.600]   Therefore, all the things that we have said, this is the conclusion.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.280]   So we're moving from indicatives to imperatives.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   Now the main emphasis in chapter 12 and 13 is considering who Jesus is.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.440]   If he is truly superior over everything else in this world, what should that look like
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.000]   in the life of a believer?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.840]   And so he's moving into not only just this verse, not only just for the next few sermons,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.080]   but again, into the imperatives where he's going to give us instructions on what a Christian
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.120]   life should look like in perseverance.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.000]   You know, all of us probably fall into one or the other category.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.280]   I find that there are some people who naturally gravitate toward theology.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.360]   You know, you guys are thinkers.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.480]   You love to read and you love to ask questions and dig and you get frustrated that people
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.760]   don't want to have conversations about dispensationalism and, you know, hypostatic union of Christ.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.360]   And you love deep things and you get frustrated when people are not that way.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.840]   And then there are some of you that fall into the other category where as soon as we get
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.760]   into something that's a little bit deeper than what we see in scripture, we think it's
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.720]   like, "Oh, you know, we don't want to get into that.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   Those are for theologians."
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.000]   You know, if we get too deep into theology, it divides the church.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.600]   So we want to stay united.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.040]   Just tell us what to do, right?
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.680]   And so we don't need to know all that other stuff.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   And, you know, keep that in the seminary.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.560]   And we just, we just like teach us how to disciple and raise children and evangelize.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.960]   And so some of us fall into that other category.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.760]   Well, if you do one without the other, you're going to really miss the whole point of scripture
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.800]   because the point of scripture is not to get somebody who's not in the church to be in
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.480]   the church and to have people who are in the church to become members and to have members
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.600]   come out to Bible study and then have Bible study people to serve in the church.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.280]   The point of Christianity isn't to get a group of people who is not doing something to do
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.600]   something, right?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.400]   That they're not doing something outside or inside and get them to behave differently.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240]   So they didn't wake up early in the morning, so they need to wake up.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.620]   They didn't read the Bible, so then they need to read the Bible.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.280]   The point of Christianity is not simply to change our behavior.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.440]   So if all we do is go to the imperatives and say, "Just tell me what to do and I'm just
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.480]   going to do it," then you can completely miss the whole point of Christianity because the
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.160]   whole point of Christianity is to radically change our inner being so that we can see
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ so that we can become worshipers.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.840]   So if all we're doing is changing our behavior, we're not necessarily worshiping God.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.040]   We're just acting differently.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.680]   If making disciples is just getting people to act differently, all we're doing is institutionalizing
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.840]   people.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.400]   This is our expectations in the church and this is how everybody behaves.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   But what our true desire is toâ€”what God desires is to be worshiped.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.320]   And worship, true worship has to happen when there's a transformation happening inside
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.440]   of us.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.320]   And that's why the indicatives of who Jesus is is to show us his glory.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.680]   So the reason why theology is important is theology basically is a study of God.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.000]   Literally, it's a study of God.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.600]   And so the study of God causes us to see a greater glimpse of his glory and the more
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.900]   we dig, a greater glory is revealed to us in his work.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.560]   And so when that glory is revealed, therefore, if you know this, this is how you ought to
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.920]   behave.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.440]   So you cannot have the imperative without the indicatives.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.240]   You cannot have the indicatives without the imperatives.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.880]   And that's why almost all the letters in the New Testament is written in that pattern.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.900]   Book of Romans, 16 chapters, first 11 chapters are the indicatives.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.900]   This is the gospel.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.300]   This is what he has done.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.680]   This is who we have become.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.200]   This is the hope that we have.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   And therefore, in view of this mercy, this gospel, we ought to live our lives as a pleasing,
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   as living sacrifice to God.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.760]   It wasn't that long when we started the book of Ephesians, we have three chapters
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.800]   about his election, his predestination, and how he saved us, why he saved us, his purpose,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   his will.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   And then we get to chapter four, five, and six, and he says, "Therefore, live up to this
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.100]   calling that you have been given."
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.200]   So if you have a tendency to kind of like, "I don't want to get into these deep things
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.960]   and I just want to know what to do.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.300]   Give me instructions one, two, three," then you're not really truly worshiping God.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.560]   Or if you're learning all these indicatives and you know, you know, especially if you've
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.160]   been in the church for a long time, you know so much and yet you do so little.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.480]   And you completely missed the point of Christianity.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.760]   So that's why this "therefore" here is so important because we're transitioning from
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.040]   the previous indicatives.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.680]   So this is what it's going to look like in the practical life of a Christian.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.440]   This is how it ought to be practiced.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.700]   If you look at Hebrews chapter 12, 1, and we're probably not going to even make it out
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.360]   of here today, okay?
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.320]   Hebrews chapter 12, 1, it says, "Therefore, since all of this, since the supremacy of
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.240]   Christ has been established for you, therefore, since we have such great a cloud of witnesses,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.560]   these people who've gone before us as an example, let us lay aside every encumbrance of sin
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.320]   so that so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.380]   us."
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.920]   In the English, when you read it, there's a bunch of imperatives here, right?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   Consider to let us, let us put aside every encumbrance and let us put aside the sin.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.800]   Let us run.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.360]   Let us fix our eyes on Jesus.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.060]   So there's a lot of imperatives here.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.360]   But in the Greek, there's only one imperative in the Greek.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.920]   So it doesn't pop out in the English.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.840]   In English, it sounds like there's a lot of instructions going on.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.220]   But the only imperative in these three verses is let us run.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.220]   Let us run.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.800]   And so what that means is everything else that he says here are supporting, supporting
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   ideas.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.840]   How do we run this race with endurance, right?
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.700]   And so that's what we're going to be focusing on today and tomorrow and possibly the week
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.460]   after that.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.500]   Let us run.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:45.180]   Since you know all of this, if you truly believe that Christ is supreme over everything that
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:51.140]   we are tempted by, everything else in this world, if that's the case, therefore, let
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.180]   us run this race with endurance, the race that is set before us.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.780]   So there are four things that I want to highlight and I outlined it this way.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.620]   First, to look forward.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.620]   Look forward.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.260]   Second, to look back.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.020]   Third, to look within.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.300]   And fourth, to look up.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.600]   Usually I don't come up with these clever outlines.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   So this is a lot of work.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.180]   So I was like, "Oh, I like this.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.180]   I stuck it."
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.600]   So even if it doesn't fit well, let's just go with it, okay?
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.460]   So the first instruction in running with endurance, he says to look forward, meaning to look at
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.460]   the goal.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:41.580]   The final prize that God did not set us here just to start the race.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.580]   We started this race in order so that we can finish this race.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:54.340]   You know, in 1968 in Mexico City, there was a marathon that took place and all the winners
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.000]   already came in and so many hours went by.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.940]   So they already had the ceremony to award the gold medal, the silver medal, and the
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.000]   bronze medal.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.500]   And as they were wrapping up the ceremony, there was this one man that came into the
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.940]   stadium by himself, John Stephan Akwari from Tanzania.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:19.460]   And it was a strange sight because even the ceremony was all done.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.500]   So if you didn't know the context, you'd say, "Well, this guy is stubborn."
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   You know, clearly, I mean, it must be embarrassing for him to run so late.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.380]   Because after everybody was done, he was just kind of limping into the stadium.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:40.860]   But what happened to him is about midway through the run, this man from Tanzania basically
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.420]   had a very bad fall.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.620]   He bruised his shoulder, his head on the ground, and then he actually dislocated his knee.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.220]   And so he didn't know if he was going to be able to run, but he was so determined, he
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.220]   began to limp.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.220]   And this is a true story.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:01.260]   He began to limp, and he limped the other about 12, 13 miles.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.300]   And so that's why it took him so many hours to get in.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.460]   And as he was limping in, the people knew what had happened to him.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.180]   And just the fact that he finished, they gave him a standing ovation.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.100]   And he's known as the greatest last place finisher in Olympic history.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.180]   And that's why we talk about him today, even though this happened in 1968.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.860]   So after all the things were over, they came and asked him, an interviewer said, "Why
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:34.460]   did you go through that excruciating pain of running 13 hours with a dislocated knee?"
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:41.620]   And his answer was this, "My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.980]   They sent me 5,000 miles to finish it."
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.740]   Our journey with God wasn't simply mental.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.900]   He justified us, and then we just kind of trickle in, into the finish line.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:03.100]   The reason why he writes this, the whole letter, is to get people who are drifting.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.340]   They were drifting because they were simply neglecting their faith.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.900]   You know, backsliding doesn't happen because you wake up one day and say, "You know what?
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.380]   I don't know if I believe in God anymore."
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.540]   It doesn't happen that way.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.820]   Most people, it doesn't happen that way.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.940]   Most people, it just happens simply out of neglect.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:27.820]   You get busy in life, you start making a little bit of money, you travel a little bit, you
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:33.300]   buy this and you buy that, and after a while, your priorities kind of mixed up.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.940]   Have children and just busyness of life, concerns of this world.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.380]   And so we start to neglect our walk with God.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.180]   And that's why the whole letter, he doesn't say, "Don't reject Jesus.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.340]   Don't deny Jesus."
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.260]   He says, "Do not neglect."
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.620]   How can we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:57.060]   And he keeps saying, warns us about drifting.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.780]   Drifting requires no effort.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.660]   Just sit there, relax, enjoy the ocean.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.340]   Just breathe in the fresh air and you just start drifting.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.100]   And so he, the whole letter is written to people who are just kind of drifting because
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.540]   it was becoming hard to be Christian.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.220]   Our natural tendency is when we're young, we're ideological and say, "We're going to
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.700]   turn the world for Jesus Christ."
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.940]   And we're in college surrounded by friends who are encouraging us, almost shaming us
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.540]   for not walking with Christ.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:37.820]   If you're in college and you're not doing well in your faith, you get persecuted.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.620]   Where we are, "What?
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.620]   You didn't do this.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.620]   You didn't do that."
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.660]   And all of a sudden you graduate and then you get a job and you don't have that pressure
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.660]   anymore.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.660]   You don't have that accountability.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.380]   In fact, you know, where in college you were like 80%, you had this accountability.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.380]   Now it's the other way.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.740]   Now majority of the time with non-Christians where it's difficult to live your faith.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.260]   And then you struggle for a little bit when you're young and then a lot of people by the
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.180]   time they're in their mid-20s has kind of accepted that.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.100]   That's just the way it is.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.020]   And so you do a little bit of church and a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.100]   And by the time you're in your 30s, your heart has hardened.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.660]   You've heard everything.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.500]   And so you created a Christianity that doesn't really look anything like the Bible.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.660]   And you just assume, "Well, maybe that was true of them.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.380]   Maybe this is true of a few elect.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.980]   Maybe it's just for the apostles, but not for everybody."
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.860]   And so we end up prioritizing other things in this life, knowing full well that it's
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.860]   temporary.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:40.260]   Knowing full well we're just sojourners passing by, but we just simply out of neglect.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.540]   And when we neglect our salvation, we end up compromising.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.820]   So when trials come, temptations come, when we are tested, it's much easier to compromise
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   when we've been neglecting our faith, when we haven't been striving after the things
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.820]   of God.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.840]   And then when we are in a compromised state, apostasy isn't far away.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.640]   So backsliding doesn't happen one day you wake up.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.620]   It just simply happens out of neglect.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:11.520]   And that's what he was trying to say to the runners here, to the listeners, the recipients
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.880]   of this letter.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.840]   That it's not enough that you started this race, you need to finish this race.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.960]   God didn't justify you so that you can just fizzle out sometime five years, 10 years,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.680]   20 years later.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.400]   We have a tendency, the older I get, the more I hear this.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.500]   I was.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.480]   We say that about our physical life.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.420]   We also say that about our spiritual life.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:43.320]   And it's very dangerous when you're 30 years old and you begin to say, "Oh, when I was
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   in college."
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.400]   Oh, let the college kids do it.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.760]   I'm so old at 30.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.820]   And then the 40 year olds hear that and it's like, "Oh my God, you're only 30 and you're
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.600]   saying that?
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.900]   I'm so old at 40."
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:07.680]   And then the 50 year olds will hear that and it's like, "Oh my gosh, you little infants.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.600]   At 40 year old?"
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:17.620]   And I'm sure the 60 year olds don't even say anything because it is just so ridiculous.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.720]   You know what ends up happening is physically we don't retire until we're in our 60s and
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.800]   possibly 70s.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.440]   But so many people retire spiritually in their late 20s and early 30s.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.480]   That this striving after God, this running with all our might, that's something you do
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.480]   when you're young.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.640]   But as we get older, we have to raise kids, we have jobs, we have responsibilities.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   And so we just kind of have retired.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.280]   You know, and then we just like, "Oh, it's great to see the younger ones living out their
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   faith, but I'm old.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.160]   I'm 30.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   I'm 40.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.160]   I'm 50."
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:06.760]   See, God is calling us to finish this race, to finish what he started, to be justified,
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   to be sanctified, and to ultimately be glorified.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:17.200]   And that's why the word that is used here for this race is agonai, a marathon, not a
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.760]   sprint.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.160]   Our natural inclination is to give attention to the sprinters.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.360]   I mean, let me illustrate this.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.680]   Who's the fastest runner in recent history?
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.360]   Record it.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   You all know.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   Usain Bolt, right?
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   I don't know what his time is, but he's really fast.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.760]   Fastest.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.960]   So he become a celebrity.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   Everybody knows who he is.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.880]   You don't have to be a track and field, like a connoisseur, I don't know what it is, like
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.920]   a fan of that to know, right?
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.560]   Because he's on television.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   He's in movies.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.320]   He makes commercials because we naturally gravitate towards the sprinters.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.680]   Who's the fastest marathon runner?
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:15.720]   Unless you're some weirdo who likes to run marathons, most of you, most of you probably
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.560]   don't know, right?
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   We don't gravitate toward marathon runners.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.520]   The fastest recorded marathon runner is a guy named Eliud Kipchoge, which you're not
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.480]   going to remember and neither will I after today.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:36.180]   His time was set in 2018 Berlin Marathon, and his fastest time recorded is two hours
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.160]   and one minute and 39 seconds.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.880]   We don't keep track of that, or at least the record keepers do, but most people don't know
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.440]   because we naturally gravitate toward the sprinters.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:56.240]   And even in our spiritual walk, we have a tendency to elevate people who are sprinters.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.600]   They're gifted, they're talented, they have large churches, wrote great books, and they
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.720]   write great things, have great blogs, have more than a million followers on Facebook
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.120]   and TikTok and whatever.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.240]   And so they're the sprinters.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.600]   But the ones who are just chipping away, just being faithful in the background, they don't
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.080]   really get much press.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.040]   And they're the ones who faithfully finish.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.440]   A lot of people just kind of flash and then once they're done with the sprint, they're
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.800]   just out there, right?
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.440]   But the marathon runners have to agonize.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.320]   They know agony.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   They struggle.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.680]   And that's the word that is used here to describe a Christian walk.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.920]   In other parts of the Bible, our spiritual life is described as a struggle, a strife,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.360]   a wrestling, a boxing match, and even warfare.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.960]   And we are often called soldiers.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.780]   In modern day history with the church growth movement, we hear a lot of talk about the
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.680]   church needing to be a hospital.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.880]   And that is not wrong, right?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.240]   People are sick.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.680]   And so people need healing.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.600]   But I think the problem with that is a lot of people in our generation only see the church
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.800]   as a hospital, a place to be loved and be safe.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.080]   But when we start talking about agonizing and struggling and striving and warfare, it
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.200]   almost sounds foreign.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.000]   Even though the Bible clearly states, I mean, if you're talking about percentage, more of
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.760]   our spiritual life is described as agonizing, where we get the word agony.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:44.800]   And we are challenged not only to simply sign up for the race, but to run as to win.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.680]   In 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27, Paul says, "Do you not know that those who run in a race
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.180]   all run, but only one receives the prize?
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.640]   Run in such a way that you may win."
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.260]   Now think about the context of this, right?
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.880]   Why is Paul telling them to run in this way?
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.560]   Because the Corinthians got entangled with who's better, who's more spiritual.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:15.920]   You know, I like Apostle Paul, I like Apollos, I like Peter, and then some is like, I like
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.260]   Jesus.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:24.640]   So they were competing with each other, all kinds of chaos in the church, and they've
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.240]   taken their eyes off of where they were supposed to go.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.560]   And so the whole letter is written to kind of encourage them and to rebuke them to get
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.320]   back on track.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   That you're just satisfied that you're on this journey, you signed up, and you're comparing
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.540]   your outfits.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:47.700]   And that's why he's saying, everybody runs, but to run to win.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.160]   You know, some people who just kind of get on into the race, sign up for the race, you
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.240]   know, but you can clearly tell that they're not there to really win.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:04.160]   You know, they wear the wrong shoes, you know, maybe they got a coat on because it's cold,
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   and they're talking and chatting with their friends while they're running.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.820]   You know, they're high-fiving their friends, they're posing for pictures.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.320]   You could tell who's in this race to tell their friends that they ran the marathon,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.440]   even though it took them four and a half days, right?
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.060]   Because they're not interested in the race itself.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.820]   They're interested in the fact that they actually went.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.740]   But they're not striving, right?
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.200]   But the ones who want to win, you know, they got the proper shoes on.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.680]   Sometimes they won't even pick up a drink because they're afraid it's going to slow
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   them down.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.040]   They're not going to sit and like take pictures while they're running, because that few seconds
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.760]   matter because they're trying to win.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.700]   And so Paul says, we all run the race, but he said, you need to run to win the race.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.880]   Not just be satisfied that you are in the race.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.440]   Verse 25, everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.400]   Self-control meaning everything is determined by this race.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.340]   They practice this self-control by asking themselves, is this going to benefit me or
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.920]   not benefit me in this race?
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.680]   That's why they practice self-control.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.820]   They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.240]   Even non-Christians pack up their bags and their young children and they'll go to a very
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:32.260]   difficult part of the world, living a very difficult life because they believe that that
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.680]   will give them the greatest success in this world.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.600]   Maybe there's some business going on there.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.280]   Maybe that's where you want to go because you'll get the greatest amount of money.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.200]   Some people will live in Alaska, right?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.720]   They'll live in Alaska because the pay is much better.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:53.560]   So even the secular world will sacrifice many things and be disciplined to get an imperishable
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   wreath.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.880]   And so Paul is using that as saying, everybody practices this.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.720]   How much more should we for what is imperishable?
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.400]   If they do it for perishable, we should do it for imperishable.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.640]   Therefore I run in such a way as not without aim.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.000]   Not without aim, meaning that there's no clear goal.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.680]   That everything that we do is what makes me happy today.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.760]   If it makes you happy, why is it so bad?
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.000]   Do you know that song?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.520]   Don't tell me that song.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.080]   But that's kind of like the mantra of our day.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.800]   If it makes me happy, why is it so bad?
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.040]   I do it.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880]   I run in such a way not without aim.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.760]   I box in such a way as not beating the air.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.280]   Basically shadow boxing, right?
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   Shadow boxing.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.400]   Nobody's hitting you and you're not hitting anybody.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.820]   And you don't need to train for shadow boxing.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.600]   There's no danger of being knocked out.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.880]   And there's no goal of knocking anybody else out.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.700]   So you don't need to be trained.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.780]   So when you're shadow boxing without aim, it doesn't matter if you pray.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.280]   It doesn't matter because you're not trying to knock anybody out.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.640]   You're not trying to accomplish anybody.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.820]   All you have to say is, "I did it."
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.960]   If you have the number on your chest, that's enough.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.120]   You're not trying to win.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   You just got in.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.400]   So you're just shadow boxing, right?
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.640]   So if you do Bible study, you do Bible study because your church asks you to do Bible study.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   That's part of the covenant.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   So I just do it.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   So I put the number on.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   But you're just going through the motion.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.720]   The Word of God, all it is is just information.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.600]   So I do it and people get off my back.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.720]   If I don't do it, there's no effect because I'm not necessarily using the Bible for any
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.880]   other purpose other than to show people that's what I'm doing.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.360]   So if you're shadow boxing, it's enough to just go through the motion.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.660]   If you're shadow boxing, it's enough to just attend church.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.660]   If you're shadow boxing.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:05.720]   But if you're committed to the struggle to win, shadow boxing is nothing.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.000]   You're just playing.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.240]   And that's what he's trying to tell the Corinthians.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.040]   That you guys are just playing games.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.940]   You're not necessarily wrestling.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.280]   You're not engaging in spiritual battle.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.840]   And that's part of the reason why prayer in our generation is so weak because we're just
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.480]   shadow boxing.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:33.680]   If you are wrestling to bring non-Christians to Christ, no amount of strategy, no amount
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:40.720]   of reading books, no amount of learning, no amount of talent can change a man's heart.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.520]   That's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.620]   And it forces us to recognize that what God asks us to do is beyond us.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:57.240]   So if you're not wrestling and there's no clear aim and just going through the motion,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.720]   then if you just check off the box, right?
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   Did it.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   Did quiet time.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   Did I pray?
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   You know, they told me to pray five minutes.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   I prayed five minutes.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.840]   I showed up to praise and prayer and I did the assignment.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.440]   And that's enough.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:17.360]   But when we are wrestling to win, that's where the struggle comes in.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:23.440]   But again, like I said, the greatest struggle in our generation and where you and I live
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:30.320]   is that the normal, the normal average Christian behavior is shadow boxing.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.600]   There's a lot of spiritual things that are happening.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.240]   A lot of just boxing, not hitting anything.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:44.760]   A lot of like form without substance.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.640]   If you get too excited about your faith, one of the first things that you'll hear from
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   people is relax.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.160]   Relax.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.680]   Relax.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.000]   Why, you know?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.520]   Why are you getting so uptight?
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.520]   Why are you like that?
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.520]   You know?
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.520]   It's like, God didn't call everybody.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.680]   God's not saying that we need to be poor.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.720]   God's not saying we need to do that.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.760]   Now, where do we draw the line?
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:20.120]   And so we have all these things that we say to kind of calm everybody down so that we
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:27.360]   can kind of live a average life and just kind of coast along.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.440]   And if you get beyond this, like, oh, he's a fanatic.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.000]   He's a Jesus freak.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.440]   And if you get really serious, why aren't you in ministry?
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.200]   You should be a missionary.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.520]   So if you're passionate about God, right, and you're wrestling and struggling, you belong
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.720]   in ministry.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.120]   The rest of us, we're just going to sit back and watch you.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.640]   I'll give you a high five as you run by.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.360]   See, that's shadow boxing.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.920]   And that's what he's trying to say.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.000]   He said, to run, therefore, considering the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.160]   let us run this race with endurance, to finish this race.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:09.240]   In Amos chapter 6, verse 1, the greatest problem of the Israelites was not that they weren't
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.840]   taking their temple sacrifices seriously.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.440]   In fact, during that period, right before the Assyrians came and took them into captivity,
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.720]   there were more sacrifices were given at that temple than probably any other time before
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.880]   that period.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:30.600]   But the primary message of the prophets that God sent was that all that you're doing is
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.920]   shadow boxing.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.760]   It's just fluff.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.800]   There's no real worship going on.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.080]   In Amos chapter 6, verse 1, it says, "Woe to those who are in ease in Zion."
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   They're relaxing, right?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.600]   And he's like, oh, Yahweh is my God.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   Clearly He's for us.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   He's a covenant people.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.840]   And they were just ease in Zion.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:01.560]   And those who feel secure in mountain of Samaria, meaning they relied on their topography, right?
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.480]   When the enemies come, we have this great mountain to fight on, and we can conquer all
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   our enemies.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.760]   Ease at Zion and feel secure at Mount Samaria.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:17.520]   Again, in Amos chapter 6, 4 through 6, those who recline on beds of ivory and sprawl on
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.120]   their couches, beds of ivory, which you and I don't have, right?
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.720]   So we can't be guilty of that.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:31.280]   But modern-day version of it would be your memory foam, right?
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:39.080]   Those who recline on your nice king-size memory foam and sprawl on your recliners and eat
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:46.520]   lambs from flock and calves from the midst of the stall, your Korean barbecues, who improvise
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.700]   to the sound of harp, your music.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:55.200]   And like David has composed songs for themselves, who drink wine from the sacrificial bowls
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.360]   while they anoint themselves with finest oil, skincare.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.520]   Now, is this saying that all of this is sin, that we can't sleep on bed?
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.200]   Now we've got to sleep on cement ground, right?
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.080]   Korean barbecue is from the devil, right?
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.680]   Skincare is from Satan.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.440]   No, obviously that's not what he's saying.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.960]   There are plenty of people who are very wealthy who did godly things with their finances.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   It's what he says after.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:31.680]   He says, "Yet you have all of these great things that God gave you because he blessed
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.120]   you."
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.960]   God wasn't saying like, "All my children need to be poor and be suffering and can't have
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   nice things."
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.720]   He said, "I blessed you with all these things, yet they have not grieved over the ruin of
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.320]   Joseph."
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:52.400]   When it came to the things that really mattered, instead of seeing these good things as a blessing
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:58.360]   to use for God's glory, you just self-indulge and that's all it was.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.760]   You use all the blessings, all the finances, all the things you have so that we can live
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.200]   nice and have nice things, and that was it.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:12.600]   And when it came to lost souls who are going to be judged when God comes, you just kind
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.200]   of swept that under the rug.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:21.680]   And that's why the judgment was coming, of their constant shadow boxing without really
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.080]   being in the fight.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.340]   Again, that's what this "therefore" is.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:32.320]   Everything that he said up to this point, "Therefore," knowing all of this that I've
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:38.360]   said, knowing all of this of who Jesus is, "Therefore, let us finish this race.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.400]   Let's run this race with perseverance."
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.920]   He says the word for endurance is literally "hupomone," it means to submit.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.280]   It means to place yourself, to bear yourself under pressure.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.520]   That's what that means.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:59.560]   And the reason why he says this to them is because they did well in the sprint.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.620]   In fact, in the sprint, these guys were Usain Bolts.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.960]   They got there fast and they were celebrating even their material goods being confiscated.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.600]   People were going to jail and they're like, "Man, we're being persecuted for Christ."
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.560]   But then when they realized it was a marathon, they started slowly, started being discouraged.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.760]   It's like, "Oh shoot, they're actually dying.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.320]   Oh shoot.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.720]   This is not, this is not relenting."
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.000]   You know, it wasn't like Joseph where he suffered and then at the end he was magnified
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.520]   and he used him for great things.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.320]   They realized maybe they're Jeremiah, you know, that this suffering wasn't going to
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.640]   ever lend and maybe that is their purpose.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.960]   And they started drifting out and that's why he says not only to run this race, to
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.080]   stay under.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:52.240]   Because our natural tendency is when we're under pressure, either to change our circumstance
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.040]   or change our theology.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.760]   So our immediate action is to change our circumstance.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.680]   This pressure, I feel this pressure, right?
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.920]   We lived it with this tension between heaven, we're not there yet and we're saved.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.520]   So we're kind of in this middle ground and because of that we feel pressure.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.360]   We feel like we don't belong.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.240]   So we're constantly reminded of that.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.760]   And we're living nice but we feel people suffering.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.880]   We know people who don't know Christ and we feel like we need to share the gospel with
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.080]   them but what if we do that?
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.720]   We're going to lose our job and we're living with this tension.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:39.560]   So our natural tendency is change our circumstance, change our neighborhood, change our job because
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.920]   this is the pressure we don't want.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.520]   Or we change our theology.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.120]   Oh, that's not what God wants.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.920]   It's because of these legalists.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.400]   Oh, they're not interpreting the Bible correctly.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.160]   Oh, that's his personality.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   That guy's always angry.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:03.800]   And so we change our theology so we create a theology that accommodates this easy life.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.760]   But the Bible says this pressure is normal because we're aliens and strangers.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:15.800]   It's when we think that there is no pressure, there is no longer this struggle, that you've
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.440]   run this race and let the kids take care of it.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.120]   And we're just kind of coasting along and then when you see the waves coming, we got
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.200]   to go back to shore.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:33.160]   And yet the Bible constantly reminds us of this pressure that we are under.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.240]   That is normal because we're aliens and strangers in this world, in a foreign land that is hostile
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.880]   to the message that you and I have embraced and loved.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.220]   And we are actively sharing.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.640]   So he says do not think it's strange when they don't accept you.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.480]   Do not think it's strange when you don't belong, when you don't fit in.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.640]   Do not think it's strange when you say things that are straight out of the Bible and they
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.000]   call you a hate monger.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.760]   Do not think it's strange because we live in a fallen world that is hostile toward God.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:10.380]   So those children who actively follow Christ are also going to face some sort of hostility.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.960]   Do not think it's strange.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.200]   Do not turn to the left or to the right.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.120]   Do not turn to the left or to the right.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:25.240]   That pressure that you feel as an alien and stranger in this world is supposed to be there.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.860]   That's part of our sanctification.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.920]   That's a part of a reminder that we don't belong.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.320]   And our constant wrestling and tweaking and planning to have it better fit in this world
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.740]   is what's destroying the church.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.720]   To make the church as palatable as possible so that the people who have committed to the
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:53.520]   pattern of this world can feel at home in the church is what's killing the church.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.960]   This is a completely different kingdom with a completely different king.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.680]   And our followers are supposed to be completely different.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:09.240]   So this struggle, this agony, this wrestling match, this warfare that we are a part of,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.560]   he says don't forget where we're headed.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   Don't forget the race that we're in, that we're in this struggle, we're in this battle.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.920]   Let me get to at least number two, okay?
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.720]   I'm not going to get to number three.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:29.600]   He says to consider as we fix our eyes on this path to look back, consider the cloud
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.560]   of witnesses that has gone before us.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.880]   Not that they are looking at us, cheering us on.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.240]   He said no, they've been set before us as examples for us to follow.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.000]   Some of them endured much agony and God delivered them.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.960]   And so they were all mentioned in chapter 11.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:55.600]   And then some of them, no fanfare, no great hoopla, no names being written, just died
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.400]   in agony, just faithfully following Christ.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:06.640]   And whether they saw any glory, whether they died in a difficult situation, they all finished
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.560]   the race.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.900]   And that's exactly what Paul says at the end of his life.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.840]   He says he finished the race.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.680]   He doesn't give a compliment, I planted a church here and I did this and I wrote so
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.080]   many passages.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   He doesn't mention any of that.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.800]   At the end of his life and he's summarizing his life, he says my life is being poured
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.460]   out as a drink offering, meaning I'm going to die.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.480]   And all he says is I have finished the race.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   I finished it.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.640]   You know, I think every single one of us, if I asked you what's your favorite character
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   in the Bible and you would probably name somebody, right?
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.080]   For whatever the reason, right?
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:50.760]   Me like automatically I would say Moses is one of those guys, right?
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.800]   And it's not because of his great leadership.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.840]   Moses is a guy that always stands up to me as an encouragement too because this guy came
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.200]   into ministry kicking and screaming, you know?
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.800]   And I told you last week, Jeremiah is another guy, you know, because he's agonizing.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:13.600]   I mean, if you're too happy one day and you want to balance some of that, read Lamentations,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.720]   right?
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.380]   Or Jeremiah.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.880]   Or even Psalms, right?
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.640]   I mean, they'll level you out, right?
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.680]   And then you're going to have to go to Philippines to bring you back up.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.840]   Jeremiah is a guy who's just like, oh, he's like, why?
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.760]   And then even Apostle Paul.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.800]   You know, the letter that I gravitate toward is 2 Peter and 2 Timothy.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.000]   I mean, man, 2 Peter is hard to read, you know?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.080]   I mean, he risked his life to bring the gospel to these people and they're saying, because
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.240]   they didn't like what he had to say, it's like, that guy's not an apostle, right?
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:56.720]   I mean, his letters are strong, but his appearance is not impressive, right?
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.240]   He's not the best speaker.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.040]   And they were criticizing him.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.360]   He's like defending himself.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   I am an apostle.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.080]   And the only reason why he's defending himself is because he's trying to tell them to listen.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.840]   There's grave danger if you don't listen.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.720]   And then Apostle Paul, the last letter he writes, he basically tells Timothy, don't
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.680]   let this happen to you.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.480]   All these guys are falling out.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   They love the world more than God, and so they went back.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.120]   Don't let this happen to you, right?
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.660]   He said, you preach, even if they don't want to listen, in season and out of season.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.640]   You keep preaching it, even if they don't want to listen.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.440]   Even if your life becomes hard, you preach.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   Don't turn.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.440]   You preach.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.640]   And that was the last letter.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:45.720]   You know, I've always gravitated toward these people, and only recently I realized, like,
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.680]   huh, they all have similar character.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.320]   They're all people who are reluctant, but remain faithful.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.480]   And I find great encouragement in them, not because of the great things that they've done,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.840]   but because they're just faithful.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.160]   They had their eyes on the prize, and they just made it to the end.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.920]   Read the book of Psalms.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.600]   Two-thirds of it is complaining.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   Why?
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   Why?
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   Two-thirds.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   We gravitate toward Psalm 23.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.720]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.120]   I shall not be in want.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.040]   He leads me beside quiet water.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:30.760]   I mean, we put it on, you know, plaques, and we quote it.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   Two-thirds.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.560]   Two-thirds of Psalms is, "Why?
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.040]   Why do you let the wicked prosper?
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.640]   When are you going to answer my prayers?
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.840]   How long?"
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.120]   Two-thirds.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.280]   My enemies are all around me.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.760]   Where can I go to escape?
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.240]   It's because that's the human experience.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.560]   You and I live in a fallen world.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.440]   The God of this age is Satan.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.200]   He doesn't like God's children.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.480]   And so living in a fallen world is naturally, there's going to be struggles.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:18.640]   There's struggles when you're young, and there's struggles that come when you're old.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.960]   There's a struggle because you're single, and then there's struggles that come because
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.560]   you're married.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.320]   There's a kind of struggle that comes because you don't have children, and there's a kind
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.280]   of struggle that comes because you have children.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.880]   There's a struggle that you have from being unemployed, and there's a kind of struggle
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.320]   that comes from being employed.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:51.000]   When you're working, when you're retired, every stage of life, there's a struggle because
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.160]   we haven't made it to the end.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.960]   The struggle isn't just the first mile, or the second mile, or the eighth mile, or the
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.600]   twenty-fifth mile.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.960]   Until we finish the line, finish and finish this race, the marathon isn't over.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.480]   So until our life is over, there is no real rest.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.920]   Our Sabbath is when we meet Christ.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:20.720]   So until then, he says, "Agonai," struggle.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.720]   Struggle to get to that rest.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.040]   Look at the people that have gone before us as an example.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.520]   You know, I mentioned all these people, and Martin Luther, and James Frazier, and Jim
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.520]   Elliot.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.280]   These are people that made an impact in my life in reading the biography.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:43.520]   But now as a bit older, I look back at my life and say, you know, probably outside of
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.000]   my immediate family, the guy who discipled me when I was in college, and he discipled
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.280]   me for about three years, probably made the biggest impact.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.320]   And part of the reason why is because I was so hungry.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.940]   And he just, he wasn't gifted, he wasn't necessarily, said something, I don't remember a single
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.880]   thing he said.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.600]   I should have listened to him better, but it wasn't because of anything he said.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.120]   It was just he chose to love me.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.860]   And he dedicated himself to be there when I needed him.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.280]   And that was enough for me.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.520]   And anything that he did, I wanted to do.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.000]   We have a tendency to put people on a pedestal that are far off.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.400]   That's why we write books about, you know, Martin Luther.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.440]   And every once in a while, I'll read, you know, stories of missionaries, like, oh, you
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.760]   know, like, Jim Elliot did this, and, you know, we had Amy Carmichael woke up at three
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:41.200]   in the morning and, and, you know, visited 50 villages and brought 10,000 people to Christ.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.720]   And it's like challenging, but like, who does that?
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.400]   I don't know anybody who does that.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.160]   Martin Luther, you know, like, we have a cult from him, it's like, oh, you know, when he
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.280]   was busy, he prayed four hours, but when he was really busy, he prayed seven hours.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.480]   When did he study the Bible?
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   When did he meet with people?
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   Right?
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.960]   But we have a tendency to kind of highlight the good things from people from a distance
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.940]   and then say, well, these are cloud of witnesses that have gone before us.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.960]   That's why all the dead people are perfect.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:17.760]   You know, you go to funerals and, and no flawed people ever die.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.080]   Only perfect people die.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.100]   Because at the funeral, they're perfect, because we don't highlight their flaws.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.840]   So we tend to appreciate people who are more farther away, because we highlight the good
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.600]   and nobody knows their weakness.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.320]   But the greatest cloud of witnesses in our lives are usually very, very flawed people
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.980]   who are very, very close to us.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:46.000]   People that we know their flaws very well, inside and out.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.800]   And they seem just like us.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.840]   In fact, some things are worse than us.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.280]   But they dedicated their life to help us, to love us, to persevere with us.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.840]   And we don't usually appreciate them until they're gone.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.680]   And it isn't until we're way older, we look back and say, well, it's like, you know, you
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.280]   don't see people dying on their deathbed.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.980]   It's like Martin Luther.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.880]   He made the biggest impact in my life.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:20.920]   Or Moses, you know, like all the hard years of my life, Moses, like really was the one
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.480]   who changed my life.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.880]   Usually at the end of our lives, we mention somebody obscure that nobody else would know,
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.320]   just only you would know.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.120]   Somebody that was close to you, flawed.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.920]   Maybe you did a lot of complaining about them.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.640]   But they left the biggest impact.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:47.800]   You know, the older I get, the more I realize how much of my dad's faith is in me.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.680]   I never got to tell him that.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.880]   You know, when I get to heaven, I'm sure, you know, I'll tell him.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.760]   But when I got saved, I got saved in a charismatic group.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.280]   My dad was a Presbyterian conservative all his life.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   So I've never seen like, you know, outpouring and like emotions.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.360]   And it was just preach the Bible and sing the hymns.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.500]   And to me, it was dead because I didn't understand it.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:16.080]   So I got saved in a charismatic church where we were, you know, praying and, you know,
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.120]   and singing out loud and casting out demons.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.120]   And we're doing all this stuff.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:25.200]   And my dad's faith seemed very foreign to me, very legalistic.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.480]   There's no power in that.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.800]   And then after I got a little bit older, I became a Baptist.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.080]   He's a Presbyterian, you know.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.760]   So I didn't agree with him about baptism.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.320]   So I never talked deeply about theology.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.640]   My dad was a seminary professor.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.960]   He taught Greek and Hebrew, wrote a book on church history.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.400]   And I couldn't read it because it was in Korean.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.000]   Neither did I really want to because I felt like there was such a distance between his
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.600]   faith and mine.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:05.360]   It wasn't until I got older, I started realizing how much of his day to day, day to day, the
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.680]   way he lived, who he was, made an impact on my life.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.780]   You know, like I'm 53.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.920]   I don't remember too well when he was 30 because obviously I was too young.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:22.360]   And I kind of vaguely remember him in his 40s because I was a teenager at the time.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   But I was in my 20s and probably already married, you know, by the time he was my age around
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360]   that time.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.240]   So I remember very vividly how I felt, the conversations I've had with the brief things
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.560]   that he said here and there and how much I hated him telling me about ministry.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:44.840]   I hated it because he would because he saw how I was struggling and he would always give
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.680]   me ministry advice and I didn't want to hear it.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.040]   I didn't want to hear it because I was already struggling.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.920]   And I didn't want my dad pointing out like do this and do that.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.560]   I don't agree with you.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.000]   I'm not a Presbyterian.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.920]   My faith doesn't look anything like yours.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.680]   I don't read the books that you do and I don't want it.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.560]   So anything he said, it was just kind of like, okay, okay, you know, I'm trying to be respectful,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   but I just couldn't hear it.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.440]   I had no ears to hear.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.720]   So when I thought about my faith, I always thought about these great people and the people
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.880]   that made an impact, even though it was only for two, three years in my life.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.760]   But the older I get, I hear myself saying, my dad said this.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.600]   My dad said this.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.360]   My dad did this.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.000]   Subconsciously.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.400]   I'm not even trying to dig.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.680]   It's just the things that is the most prevalent in my head are the things that my dad said
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.760]   and sometimes in passing that it just kind of came in.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:51.920]   And I look back in my life and realizing the greatest cloud of witness was in my house,
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.440]   which I didn't know at that time.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.880]   And I remember very vividly, specifically this one time, and I was already a pastor,
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:05.000]   oh, not a pastor, but I was a committed Christian, really grown in my faith.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.400]   And I went to my dad's church and there was a lot of turmoil at the church and people
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.480]   at the church were trying to vote my dad out.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.280]   They weren't happy with something.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.440]   And so something happened and I was in the Wednesday service and one of the elders stood
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.040]   up after the sermon and tried to physically attack my dad.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.040]   It was a small room.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.720]   It wasn't a big room, probably no more than about 25 people in the room.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.840]   And I was sitting between my dad and that elder.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.760]   And when he got up and he started to go toward my dad, all I could think of was if I was
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.400]   not a Christian, that's all I was thinking about.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:49.320]   If I wasn't a Christian, I would put him in an arm bar, you know, and this is before MMA,
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   right?
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.720]   I would have twisted his legs and did something and it's like, how dare you, you know?
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.560]   Because I was a Christian, I was trying to hold back.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.000]   Like I don't want to, as offended as I was, I didn't want to, I didn't want to offend
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.240]   God.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   So I kind of held my tongue and just sat there and watched this and burning in anger, but
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.560]   didn't open my mouth.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.600]   And my dad did nothing.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:18.160]   You know, my dad's character, you know, I can't remember any time that he actually lost
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.160]   his temper.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   He's just a very meek person.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:28.920]   But I remember specifically that Sunday, after that Wednesday, he came to Sunday worship
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.960]   and he was preaching a sermon in front of the same elder, in front of a room filled
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.040]   with people who are trying to get him out of the church.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.120]   I don't remember anything that he said.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.160]   All I remember was sitting in there angry at the people in the church and the whole
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.080]   time looking at my dad thinking, how does he do this?
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.880]   How does he do this week after week?
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:03.120]   Like what, what, like what do you need to have to do what he's doing and just not quit?
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.080]   And I realized at the end, and again, all of this was just kind of deep in my memory
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:16.120]   until recently, I remember that so vividly and the greatest impact, the greatest cloud
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:21.720]   of witness was somebody that I never even thanked.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   Oh man, I didn't lose it in the first service.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   Sorry.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   Give me a second.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:59.960]   James, a bond servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes who are dispersed
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   abroad greeting.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   All right, I'm back.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:11.440]   God had left a cloud of witnesses.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:24.320]   I'm pretty sure in your life, flawed people, probably very flawed people and in their flawed
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:30.760]   state, they did their best to reflect the love of God.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.320]   They weren't there by mistake.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:42.000]   I pray that as we do our best to finish this race, think of the cloud of witnesses that
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:49.800]   had gone before us.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.880]   Knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its perfect
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   result.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:00.080]   Actually, the verse actually fits so that you may be perfect and complete lacking in
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.520]   nothing.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:15.200]   So that one day when this race is finished, we can thank them ourselves.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:30.840]   Let's take a few minutes to, to really come before the Lord and pray.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:41.600]   And I know that to bigger or smaller degree that the struggle is constant.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:48.160]   Let's come before the Lord and ask for strength to remain under the struggle and persevere
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.160]   so that we may also finish the race along with those who have gone before us.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.200]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
