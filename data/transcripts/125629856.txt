[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   I'm going to cover a majority of the passage and I'm going to start in verse 8.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.240]   Okay, verse 8.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.600]   As a matter of fact, I'm only going to read verse 8 and 9 first and then we'll study the
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   rest.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.400]   It says, "But I say to the unmarried and to widow that it is good for them if they remain
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.140]   as I am.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.960]   But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.140]   to burn with passion."
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500]   Let's pray.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.060]   Father God, as we open up your word, would you give us insight?
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.340]   Would you help us to learn and understand?
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.700]   God, we know that your words contain life.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.580]   We know that your words are light to our feet.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.180]   God, we know that your words feed us and nourish us.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.580]   Would you help us, Father God, be receptive?
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.980]   And Lord, help us to have humble hearts that we might apply into our lives.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980]   God, we thank you in Christ's name.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.980]   Amen.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.980]   Okay.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.660]   So, an interesting scenario that happens really frequently amongst guys and girls,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.980]   especially let's say married couples who've been together for some time.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.660]   Men and women are different.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.400]   There are lots of differences and we understand that.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.140]   Sometimes these differences clash and they fight.
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.340]   One of the things that happens a lot, and it's the way that men and women approach things
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.860]   generally, men typically are task-oriented and are results-oriented.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.940]   They want to get it done.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.340]   Women on the other hand, different.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.020]   They might want to be more proper in what they do, or let's say if they have a task
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.860]   or a project together, a guy might just want to get the thing done.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.500]   The woman wants to do it right.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.620]   Or the experience of doing it, they want to make sure it's full and done properly.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.380]   What I mean by that is, for example, if a guy and a girl, a couple are working on a
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.780]   project to put it together, an album or build a little scrapbook together, a guy might be
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.460]   sitting here thinking, "My gosh, it's taking us like three hours, which is two and a half
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.940]   hours longer than it should have taken."
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.620]   And then the woman might be thinking, "Well, we need to do it right."
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.560]   And not only that, the woman might be thinking, "The experience of working on something together
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   is valuable.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.860]   Why are you in such a hurry?"
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.780]   And then the guy might be thinking, "Because we've got to get it done.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.260]   What matters is this, this, and this."
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.860]   Now, most stereotypically, if it's not just a project like a scrapbook, but they're putting
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.420]   together furniture, the scene is, the woman is sitting here like, "We have to do it right.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180]   The instruction says da, da, da, da, da."
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.220]   And the guy goes, "Some nerd on a computer wrote those instructions.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.220]   I don't need it."
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.740]   And then he just starts going.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.580]   And so you have difference of perspectives.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.700]   So the guy is saying, "It doesn't matter.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.060]   What matters is we get it done."
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.180]   The woman is thinking, "It does matter.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.700]   And just getting it done is not the point.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.100]   We need to do it right."
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.680]   Two different perspectives on a single matter.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.420]   Who is right?
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.020]   Well, hold on.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.060]   Answer for a minute.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.300]   If you're sitting next to your wife, don't speak up right now.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.780]   Just hold on to that thought for a moment of thinking about what matters.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.080]   And in trying to get anything done, you realize every individual has a purpose.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.240]   Every individual has a system of evaluating what is important as I do this.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   Okay?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.840]   Apostle Paul, in this letter, he's talking to a church that he loves, he spent a lot
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.120]   of time, and he's talking to a church where although we oftentimes really elevate the
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.160]   early church, the reality is they had a lot of problems.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.440]   Lots of problems.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.060]   Not only in the area of relationships like marriage, but in all other places as well.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.280]   To that church, Apostle Paul is teaching, and he gives wisdom and guidance, and he gives
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.520]   a perspective where there are opposing and competing perspectives within the church.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   Okay?
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   And to me, it's perplexing because the kind of advice and guideline, the truth that Apostle
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.640]   Paul is giving to the church might be something that we do not expect.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.120]   As a matter of fact, to me, the kind of advice and truth that Apostle Paul gives, it's profound,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.320]   it's shocking, it's countercultural, and it's a little unsettling.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   What do I mean by that?
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.940]   Well, let's begin.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.720]   Going back to verse eight and nine, Apostle Paul says this, "But I say to the unmarried
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.480]   and to the widows."
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.840]   So even in our context, we have a lot of unmarrieds, and we have people, I've talked to people
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.960]   where people are concerned about, let's say they have their father passed away, and the
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.440]   mother is at home alone.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.360]   Or they have other scenarios, where there's somebody who's a widow or a widower, what
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   should we do?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.720]   The advice that Apostle Paul gives is he says, "It is good for them if they remain even as
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   I.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.560]   But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   to burn with passion."
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.440]   This verse, young guys might, in a preliminary gloss, look at this and be like, "That's right.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   I'm burning, let's go."
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.840]   And that's how they read the verse.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   But if you're thinking through the verse more carefully, you come out with a lot of questions.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.600]   Whoa, he just told unmarried people to remain as they are.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.960]   He just told widows, who typically their friends probably say, "Dude, you just need to get
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   married.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.840]   Don't grieve too long, just move on."
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.160]   You know, that's the typical device.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.760]   Apostle Paul gave a counter-cultural advice and said, "You need to remain and stay put."
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.440]   Isn't that weird?
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.680]   And I want you to highlight or if you're taking notes, write that word down, remain.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.760]   And then he says, "But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better,"
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.520]   and the next word I want to focus on is better.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.600]   Better to marry than to burn with passion.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.880]   Apostle Paul is giving us insight and biblical truth as to what's best, what's better for
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.600]   you, what's to your benefit.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.760]   That's chapter seven in a nutshell.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.680]   Apostle Paul is giving us that kind of truth, but it is perplexing.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.440]   It is counter-cultural and it's really sensitive.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   Right?
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.880]   I mean, wouldn't it be a sensitive topic if I were to start talking and I preached and
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.680]   said, "As a pastor of young adults, stay single.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.320]   All 150 of y'all, stay single."
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   Right?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.040]   Obviously, that would be like, "What in the world is he saying?"
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   So we have questions.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.160]   How does this apply?
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   To who?
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.760]   To everybody in the church?
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   Across time?
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.040]   You know, for how long?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.960]   Right now, it's a perplexing thing for Apostle Paul to say.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.720]   So in order to make sense of it, we're going to work through the passage and now we're
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   going to jump down to verse 17.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Okay?
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.880]   So turn down and look at verse 17.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.160]   This is an important theme and verse for the entirety of the chapter and he says this,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.960]   "Only as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each in this manner, let
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.200]   him walk.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.480]   And so I direct in all the churches."
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.800]   You notice what he's saying there, right?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.240]   He said in verse 8, "Remain where you are."
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   And then in verse 17, he said, "God has assigned us to different circumstances in life, different
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.380]   scenarios in life.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.120]   And what he requires of each Christian is that you walk faithfully."
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   Clear enough.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.160]   "That you walk faithfully to what God has called you in the condition that you are."
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   And so this is a theme for the rest of the chapter.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.320]   For him to say, "Walk in the manner that you've been assigned," is to simply say, "Stay put."
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.640]   Learn to accept where you are.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.560]   And so first things we realize, we realize everybody is in different scenarios.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.920]   We really can't do blanket statement like, "Okay, everybody needs to date like this.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   After six months, do this.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.640]   After one year, engage.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.640]   Five months, engagement.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   One more, bam, we're good."
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   And if people don't do that, it's like, "What's wrong with you?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.360]   I thought we had this timeline set."
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   No.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:05.280]   Paul, so Paul actually says, "First of all, stay put and learn to do that.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.120]   To accept God's appointed position for you in your life."
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.600]   Now although that statement is clear, "Learn to accept God's position for you," that still
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.000]   has a lot of questions, doesn't it?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.400]   Because some of you guys are like, "Well, I'm fun employed and don't have no job.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.360]   I guess I'm here for life."
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.640]   Some of you guys are single.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.920]   Some of you guys are in positions where you're not happy at work.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:37.080]   Some of you guys are in positions where you're not happy in your homes, in your marriages.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.320]   And a lot of times, we are always looking for the next step.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.080]   We're always either looking to advance or progress.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.560]   So how do I apply this when an apostle Paul says, "Live out your walk as God has placed
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   you."
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.160]   We're in such different places in life.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   What do we do with all that?
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.200]   Aren't these legitimate questions?
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.560]   Well, I think one of the questions I need to ask is not only how to apply this, what
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.680]   does it look like, when should I change, but why?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.240]   Why would apostle Paul say this command to the church?
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.560]   Well, let's look at the examples that he gives first about the application of this verse
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.840]   or this principle of remaining where you are.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.760]   Let's look at verse 18 through 20.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.720]   He says, "Was any man called when he was already circumcised?
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.280]   He is not to become uncircumcised.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.880]   Has anyone been called in uncircumcision?
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.480]   He is not to be circumcised.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.000]   Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.120]   But what matters is the keeping of the commands of God.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.080]   Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called."
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:57.360]   As we focus our attention on verse 18, simply put, why should you remain?
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.840]   Verse 18 is really clear, because you cannot change certain things in your life.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.040]   If you read this in cursor, it's like, okay, a person who is circumcised shouldn't be uncircumcised,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.480]   and a person who is uncircumcised shouldn't be circumcised, because they live in a culture
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.160]   where the Jews, they look at circumcision like a rite of passage.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.120]   This is, you're right into the community of God, this is almost your rite as a man.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.160]   Super important.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.600]   But then you start thinking, what is circumcision?
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.640]   Operation, okay, it's an operation.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.400]   You can't go back.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.520]   No matter how much you're pissed off at your dad, like, "How dare you do this to me?"
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.640]   You cannot undo circumcision.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   The fact of the matter is, there are many people in this day and age where we love to
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:50.680]   change things about ourselves, our circumstance, our situation in life, but we cannot.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.280]   You can't, right?
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.560]   So Apostle Paul is sparing us from a whole lot of heartache and grief by teaching us
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.000]   there's a sense in which you can't change so much.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.560]   I mean, how many of us can really even change our nature?
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.200]   How many of us can change our setting?
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.600]   You can't.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.160]   We have a hard time controlling our kids, we have a hard time influencing our family.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.880]   How are we gonna change our life circumstances?
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.920]   Well, that's just one perspective, right?
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.600]   We obviously need to learn to accept the things that you cannot change.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   But there's more.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.320]   That's just a preliminary thought.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.560]   The second thing he says is verse 19, which is the more emphatic point I wanna make.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.760]   Circumcision is nothing.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.960]   And uncircumcision is nothing.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.560]   Think about that.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.840]   I mentioned a moment ago that to the Jewish culture, circumcision was huge.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:54.120]   I mean, circumcision in Genesis chapter 17 was the sign of the covenant of Abraham to
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.280]   God.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.360]   God's promise to Abraham to bless him and to take care of him and to grow him and make
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.960]   him a blessing to the nations.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.760]   God's promise to Abraham to make descendants and all of that was wrapped up in a symbol
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.560]   of the circumcision.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.840]   And so you would expect circumcision to be huge in the nation of Israel.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840]   And it was.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:25.280]   So huge that to call somebody like you uncircumcised, man, that was a derogatory term.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.160]   In Ephesians chapter 2, Apostle Paul says to the Gentiles, you were not of the commonwealth
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   of Israel.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.000]   You had no hope, you had no God, and he said you were called uncircumcision.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.280]   For Apostle Paul to say circumcision is nothing, that is profound.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.880]   Profoundly against the culture of the time.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.080]   You see what I mean?
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.720]   And so we learn this point.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.300]   There are certain things that we think matter so much, but in the perspective of the scriptures
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:13:00.560]   and perspective of God and the spiritual reality that Apostle Paul sees, they are nothing.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.640]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.480]   We have frustrating moments when we care so much to have certain things, to do certain
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.240]   things, and the thing about it is it's frustrating because those things really sometimes amount
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.840]   to things that do not matter.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:23.880]   As an example, I feel like Jewish culture is a lot like Korean culture or just Asian
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:30.680]   culture, you know, where they're like strict, honor-based, shame, and they shame you if
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.960]   you do something wrong, you know?
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.480]   So I just sometimes picture my mom and then I see like, okay, olden days is probably like
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   that, you know?
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.540]   Lately, though, I've been hearing a lot about people having difficulty with their parents
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.360]   when it comes to trying to choose a spouse.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.320]   And some of the scenarios, and you guys probably heard this story a thousand times, it's like,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.280]   you know, a guy and a girl get together and the guy's like, look, Mom, I found somebody
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.400]   nice.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.680]   And then they're like, oh, no, no, no, did that girl come from a bad family?
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.080]   Is there divorce in there?
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.880]   Any health issues, you know?
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.360]   They're like, what the heck is that all about?
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.920]   It doesn't matter, you know?
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.440]   Or the guy is like, does he at least have a graduate degree?
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   Like, is he set?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   Does he, you know?
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   It's like, what is that?
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.520]   The guy is godly.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.920]   He like believes the scriptures.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.200]   He's committed at church.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   He's humble.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.040]   He's nice with his words.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.840]   What does all that matter?
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.240]   And then I counsel people and they're like so frustrated.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.600]   They're like, stop it, Oma!
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.640]   You know, they're just so mad.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.080]   And there is that frustration.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.760]   And I almost sense Apostle Paul's frustration.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.040]   Why are you telling our church people to get circumcised?
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.080]   And why are you telling all the church people to be uncircumcised?
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.000]   And why are you telling our church people to eat this and eat that and do this and do
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   that?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.680]   It's like, ah, I'm so mad at you.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.960]   What matters is the keeping of God's command.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:55.440]   What matters is the heart of obedience and submission to the Lord.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.920]   So we come back to this idea.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.760]   Why does Apostle Paul teach his people, maybe you should just stay?
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.960]   Because whatever they thought mattered so much, like no, we need to do this!
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.600]   We have to have it!
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.800]   Apostle Paul's sitting there thinking, you don't see the big picture, do you?
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.280]   Whatever you thought was so important, it's not that important.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:27.040]   Now to make this point even more emphatic, even more crazy, more counter-cultural, shocking,
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.960]   he brings this next point up as another example of the principle that he has.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.560]   Starting from verse 21.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.600]   Were you called while a slave?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.920]   Do not worry about it.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.080]   But if you are able also to become free, rather do that.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.520]   For he who was called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freed man.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.080]   Likewise he who was called while free is Christ's slave.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.360]   You were bought with a price, do not become slaves of men.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.780]   Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:12.680]   So Apostle Paul now actually repeats this theme, you must remain, multiple times.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.960]   And as he's doing it, he brings up the craziest thing in my mind, it's like, how do you even
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.880]   say that?
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.200]   Were any of you called into slavery?
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.800]   Were you in bondage?
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.760]   Back at that time, people who were slaves were treated like property.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.920]   We know in American culture that slavery was horrific.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.760]   People treated like objects, bought and sold on a stage and block.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.520]   It was horrific.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:49.880]   So how does Apostle Paul say something like, do not worry about it?
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.640]   Do you guys sometimes read the Bible in a different voice?
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.840]   I was just reading, how do you, were you called to slavery?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   Forget about it.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.760]   I read it like that the first time.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.520]   How do you do that, Apostle Paul?
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.500]   Are you diminishing their experience?
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.920]   You don't care about their oppression?
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.080]   You don't care if they're hurting?
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.920]   You know a lot of slaves, they get their families torn apart.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.480]   A lot of slaves are forced to do things that completely compromises their morals.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   How do you say something like, don't even worry about it?
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.160]   The thing is, although just jokingly, the first time I read it, I kind of read it in
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.640]   that voice because I was like, that's just mind boggling.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.880]   But I don't think Apostle Paul is purposely trying to diminish what slavery is.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.600]   He's not trying to say, slavery is nothing, stop whining.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.240]   That's not his tone, I believe.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.920]   Because you notice it says, if you can, get free.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:50.400]   But what he's saying is the same point I just made a moment ago.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.520]   To you, you think your slavery is the worst, most horrific thing in your life, but that
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.160]   is your small perspective.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.320]   Because for the Christian who understands the truth of God and the spiritual reality,
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.840]   your slavery on earth is nothing compared to the bondage of sin that exists.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.080]   The eternity of hell and prison that awaits you.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.440]   Your slavery isn't the biggest problem, is it?
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.880]   Then neither is your freedom.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.160]   Your freedom, though you think it's the greatest prize, your freedom, though you think it's
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.920]   something worth going to war over, your freedom, though you think it's the biggest thing in
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.880]   your life that will solve all your problems.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:37.200]   For the Christian, what is freedom on earth when you are a slave to Christ for all eternity?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.400]   What is freedom on earth for but a short period of time when you have Christ and all the benefits
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.520]   of Christ and his authority and you're subjected underneath that and you have to learn a submission
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.640]   that goes even deeper than earthly submission?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.600]   You see my point?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.840]   Apostle Paul is not diminishing what slavery is, he's placing it in the right perspective
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.720]   of spiritual reality.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.160]   And when you do that, the things that you think are so important and matter so much
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.920]   and the things that you would die for all of a sudden don't seem so big.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.960]   That's the point.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.800]   How can a man tell somebody stop and remain?
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.280]   It's because he sees the bigger picture.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.600]   Apostle Paul sees spiritual reality, he's focusing on God's objectives, he's focusing
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:30.800]   on spiritual goals and as he does that he realizes circumcision is nothing and so is
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.040]   your freedom.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.560]   He's saying that their pursuit of their freedom is much like the circumcision, right?
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.440]   Because he calls them, don't worry about it.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.760]   So that is why he's able to say brethren, each one is to remain with God in the presence
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.240]   of God, to say with God is to walk with God in his presence, in the condition in which
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.480]   he was called.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:59.760]   Did you guys know that this, you know, for me, this thematic command and exhortation
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.560]   to remain, because I kind of glossed over this before and I didn't study it in depth,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.560]   I didn't realize how many times he repeated that or even that that's there.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:15.200]   But do you realize that that could very well be God's call for you?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   Think about it for a moment, okay?
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.160]   How counterculture it is in a generation when all of our parents, their hard work and our
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.520]   efforts are going towards you advancing in life.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.640]   And any time you stall or any time you hesitate or any time you can't, everyone's like, what
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.560]   is wrong with you?
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.600]   How come you can't get a girl?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.040]   How come you can't do this?
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.880]   Why don't you have this and why don't you have that?
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.060]   And I hope your mind is kind of racing because I don't also want to diminish what our parents
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.440]   or you are doing when you work hard, okay?
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.240]   It's not as though nothing matters, everything is, it's as though those things need to be
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.000]   placed in the right perspective spiritually.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.440]   And if we think about that, this is highly, highly counter to how we think generally.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.960]   And I hope your minds are racing, how do I apply this?
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.200]   What if I am like so unhappy at work and I just want to leave?
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.120]   Is God's will for me just to stay?
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.880]   What if I, you know, when I got saved, I was in a job that really was like base, base and
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   I didn't really want to leave.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   Would I stay?
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:29.520]   What's really interesting about this is the part of you wrestling with this is necessary
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.560]   and it should be hard because what Apostle Paul does, he does not give us a blanket statement.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.280]   Not every single person in this room is required to stay in the exact same way.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.680]   But rather you need to be thinking as Apostle Paul does in a broader spiritual perspective
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:51.080]   to see the issue that's at hand, how much does it matter in the spiritual realm?
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.800]   The issue that's at hand, how much weight does it carry in light of eternity?
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.400]   The issue that's at hand, how important is it to me and my faith?
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.240]   Well let's continue on because he's going to apply this even more.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:11.280]   Verse 25, he says this, I'm going to read verse 25 to 27.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.440]   He says, "Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.520]   as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.440]   I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   a man to remain as he is."
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.960]   There's our word again, to remain.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.360]   Are you bound to a wife?
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.120]   Do not seek to be released.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.120]   Are you released from a wife?
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.560]   Do not seek a wife.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.320]   This is really interesting stuff you guys.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.880]   He says in the beginning of this, and I want to make a side note here.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.280]   He says, "I have no command from the Lord, so I give you my opinion.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:54.520]   Now just so that you know, it's not like his opinion like it's your opinion, okay?
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.600]   He's not saying like, "Well Jesus never said anything, so I don't know, I guess we can
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   just stay.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.920]   You don't have to really try that hard again."
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.480]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.680]   Basically Jesus Christ and his earthly ministry didn't say something verbatim that he can
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.280]   quote.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.480]   But Apostle Paul says, "I have my opinion," which in the Greek sometimes is translated
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.440]   in other passages as judgment.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.880]   This is my evaluation of the matter.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   This is my conviction.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.160]   This is my judgment of what you should do.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.600]   And he says, "By his mercies, God's mercies, I'm trustworthy."
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.000]   So what he's saying, it belongs in the Bible, okay?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.360]   A side note.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.160]   But as he says that, he says some really interesting things, again, that I think is kind of confusing
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   and to me I was perplexed.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   And he says, "I think it's good."
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.040]   So remember I said better and remain.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.400]   Those are the two words I keep thinking about.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.400]   And so he says it's good.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:50.520]   In view of the present distress, right, that it's good for a man to remain as he is.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.360]   And then he talks about two spectrums.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.320]   Let me ask you, how do you view marriage?
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.240]   People have different spectrums of how they view marriage.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.600]   To some people it's like the holy land.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.400]   Once I get married it's going to be amazing.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   That's going to be sweet.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.960]   There's going to be, you know, harmony, companionship.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.400]   There's obviously going to be physical intimacy.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   We're going to make babies.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   We're going to have family.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.000]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.680]   And then there are the other people.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.440]   Are you bound to a wife?
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   You know?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440]   They're like reading Apostle Paul.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   It's like, "Yes, I am."
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   You know, I don't know.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   I don't know what they're thinking.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.200]   But there's a spectrum of perspective on what, how marriage is, right?
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   And so I'm like, "What, Apostle Paul, what are you saying?"
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.800]   It's like he's asking these weird questions.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.440]   Are you bound to a wife?
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.440]   Do not seek to be released.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.640]   Are you released from a wife?
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.040]   Do not seek a wife.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.560]   How do you, what the, you know what I mean?
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.960]   Do you guys see the perplexity in this?
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.720]   Why I say it's confusing?
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.560]   Someone could look at this passage and come out feeling like, "Wait a minute.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.400]   I don't get it.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.720]   Apostle Paul almost sounds like he's diminishing marriage.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.640]   But here at Berean, we hold the marriage in high honor because Hebrews chapter 13 tells
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.800]   us verbatim, "Hold marriage in high honor."
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.320]   Apostle Paul wrote Ephesians chapter five where it's like, "Husbands, love your wives
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.640]   as Christ loved the church.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.240]   And wives, submit to your husbands and respect them and love them."
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.360]   And what's going on, right?
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.640]   And I realize maybe I'm missing the point.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.960]   So let's look at this passage even more, okay?
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.440]   Let's go to verse 28.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.600]   He says, "Well, but if you marry, you have not sinned.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.640]   And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.280]   Yet such will have trouble in this life.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.920]   And I am trying to spare you."
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.840]   I get it.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.640]   So I think I get it.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.040]   Up until this point, I was confused.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.600]   How does Apostle Paul view marriage?
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.200]   He sees it like a bad thing or something.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.920]   And he's saying, "Not necessarily.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.320]   If you get married, it's not sin.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.480]   If you want to get married, you're not doing anything bad.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.280]   God created marriage.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.080]   God's the author of marriage and he blesses marriage.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   That's great."
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.280]   But he says something here which is really interesting.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:11.920]   Practically, practically speaking, for people who think marriage is the holy land and singleness
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.640]   is not, he makes the arguments like which one's actually really better practically?
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.400]   He says something interesting, which is, "In this current distress, it is good for you
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400]   to remain."
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.200]   What does he mean by that?
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.840]   Well, I'm just going to say that there are lots of views.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.120]   I counted like six views.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.960]   I was like, "Man, there's six views on one verse?"
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:40.280]   Some of the commentaries say, "Look, the distress, you think of it like the conflict of the world
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   and the spirit."
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:48.000]   They're saying, "Basically, when you become Christian, you are automatically at odds with
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.240]   the worldly views."
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   There's already a conflict.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.920]   The worldly system is get married, have a baby, raise a family, and die.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.760]   That's the worldly system.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.120]   Their interpretation was, "You are against the worldly system, so it's better for you
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   to stay single."
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.200]   It's kind of like, "I don't know."
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.080]   Then other people have said, "Well, current distress, he's talking to the church.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:15.200]   There's a lot of distress, unsettling, there is strife, there's pride, there's bickering."
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.040]   An interpretation that I think is more profound is, Apostle Paul wrote this.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.240]   In verse eight, when he started the thought, he said, "Be like me."
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.760]   Apostle Paul is in current distress, meaning there is violence done to him.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.680]   He's been persecuted.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.000]   He's been chased out of cities.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   He's been stoned.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.040]   He's been left for dead.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.840]   Can you imagine if he had a wife and little kids to drive along with that?
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.240]   He says, "Practically speaking, for the Lord's work, what's actually better?
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.880]   To have a family or to be single?"
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.920]   He says, "To have a family would be much harder.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.600]   I don't want to spare you from all that trouble."
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.380]   For many of us, we can attest to this fact.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.760]   If we get hurt, we get hurt.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.800]   We're not going to cry a river about it.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.360]   But sometimes the deepest pain is if our family suffers.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.440]   If I see my kids sick and if they're hurting, if I see my parents hurting, if I see my brother
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.960]   and sister hurting, if I see other people hurting, I want to help but I can't do that
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:24.920]   much because I'm so limited and the pain they feel causes me anguish greater than if I were
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.880]   to go through it myself.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.280]   That's sometimes very true, is it not?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.580]   So Apostle Paul says, "Practically speaking, I want to spare you the trouble.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.680]   So it's better if you remain single."
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.920]   Is that the main point?
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.960]   Could be what he's saying, but let's continue.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:48.440]   Verse 29, "But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened so that from now on those
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.520]   who have wives should be as though they had none."
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   What?
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.320]   "And those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.440]   did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use the
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.520]   world as though they did not make full use of it, for the form of this world is passing
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   away."
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.480]   I say, what?
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.920]   Because not only did he say, "Hey, for those of you guys who are single, perhaps it's better
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.440]   just to remain that way because initially I thought Apostle Paul is giving you practical
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   wisdom.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.480]   It's better for you to stay single."
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.480]   Right?
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.160]   And he's negatively trying to prevent you from experiencing things that you don't have
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.640]   to.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.920]   But all of a sudden he brings in another angle and says, "But for all of you guys who are
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.120]   married, you should live as though you weren't married."
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.280]   What is that all about?
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.120]   And I come back full circle to this point that I've been making the whole time.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120]   Why?
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:52.800]   Why and how is he making this command for you to remain in the situation that you are?
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   How would you do this?
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.240]   For you to not seek a wife?
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.160]   Or for you to pretend, I guess?
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   Is that what you're supposed to do?
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.760]   Like you don't have one?
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.920]   But obviously that's not the point.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:13.400]   The point is that in the various life circumstances that we have, we sometimes so often think
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.680]   that the solution to all the major problems is to change those circumstances.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.520]   Right?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.560]   You guys know what I'm saying.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.520]   This is a truth that probably isn't new to you, but I want us to be reminded of this
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.920]   this morning.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.200]   So many times we believe the various problems and the things that we want are going to be
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.000]   satisfied by the change in our circumstance.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.640]   And essentially what he's saying, Apostle Paul is saying by teaching us that one who
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.880]   is married is like one who is not, and the one who is not married is like one who is,
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.560]   and going back and forth with that, is truly because of that point.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:31:00.960]   What you think matters and provides and satisfies so much is actually not so much.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.080]   Marriage does not solve your problems.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.760]   If you're alone and you look to marriage for companionship, guess what?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.040]   If you're a loner, you're going to be a loner in marriage and you're going to make your
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   wife a loner.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.080]   I know this because I have loner tendencies.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.080]   All right?
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.720]   If you've known me long enough, yes, I love fellowship and I love being with people, but
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.520]   I will prefer sometimes to go eat by myself.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.400]   And so I ended up making Bia do that.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.400]   Like, "I just want to go home.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   Let's go."
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.400]   You know?
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.600]   And that happens.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.000]   The marriage situation is not changing the man.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.640]   If you're struggling physically, let's say two people are dating, God forbid, but sometimes
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   it happens, they start crossing boundaries, they start breaking their promises and faithfulness,
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.840]   and they start taking advantage of the situation, committing sins of sexual immorality.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.320]   And sometimes what happens is a young man will come to me and ask counsel and they'll
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.800]   say, "Pastor Mark, I kind of don't know what to do."
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.920]   And they're like, "Man, you know, in the end I just need to get married."
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.280]   Bible says, "If you burn, get married."
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.200]   You see the perspective there?
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   Really?
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.080]   How do you think your marriage is going to solve your lust?
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.680]   Many a man will testify to the fact that marriage does not solve lust.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.400]   As a matter of fact, lust becomes all the more sinful in marriage.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.760]   As a matter of fact, if you had a pattern of using situations and people to satisfy
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.320]   your cravings, you will do that all the more in your marriage.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.240]   So what is all this?
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.400]   Pastor Paul is taking marriage and taking singleness and he's saying, "You see the
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.800]   balance here?
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.080]   You see your perspective?
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.280]   You see your worldview where you weigh this like so heavy and so great and you weigh this
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.320]   so low or you weigh this so high and so this?
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   What true spiritual benefit is there in either of these?"
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.120]   And we come back to the point, what matters is the keeping of the commandments of our
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   God.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.400]   Why do I say this?
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.000]   Because he says it emphatically at this next point that I want to go over.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.680]   So I stopped here at verse 31.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.360]   I'm going to read from verse 32 down to verse 35.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.760]   But I want you to be free from concern.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.360]   One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   Lord.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.120]   But one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120]   his wife.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.440]   And his interests are divided.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.720]   The woman who is unmarried and the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.200]   that she may be holy both in body and spirit.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.160]   But the one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.920]   her husband.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.360]   And then this is the emphatic point I would like you to either highlight or bold or jot
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.440]   down and star.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.320]   All of this that he's been teaching, all the commands that have been both confusing and
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.520]   hard to balance has been for this.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:54.880]   This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but to promote what is
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.960]   a pure, undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.560]   That's the key.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.120]   That's the key we need to accept.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.560]   It is not the condition.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   I need to stop blaming the condition.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.040]   I need to stop blaming the scenario.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.760]   People who perhaps they're not active at church, people who are not doing certain things like,
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   "Ah, you know how it is.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.160]   You know how married life is.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.640]   You know how family life is.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.920]   When you get married, you have to do this and you have to do that."
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.880]   He's saying that's exactly the point.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.440]   That's the pattern of every single person.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.640]   But what that points to is not the problem in the marriage.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.360]   What that points to is the problem of devotion.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.080]   The problem of devotion in the man who enters the marriage.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.120]   And I am extremely humbled by that.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.360]   Are you?
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.200]   In your perspective, have you been blaming your life circumstances for why you're bitter,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.040]   why you're mad, why you're not being fruitful enough?
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.440]   Maybe, rather than asking God, "Just change this for me.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   Just do this for me."
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.040]   You should ask God, "Change me in this.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:05.320]   Help me to learn how to be both content, striving, fruitful, loving, devoted to you in this."
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.000]   Because the circumstances change all the time.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.840]   When he is talking earlier about how the time is short and for marriage relationships, relationships
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   change.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.040]   You're weeping and you're rejoicing change.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   You're possession.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040]   Sometimes you have a lot.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   Sometimes you don't have a lot.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.160]   But all of that don't matter.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.440]   If your spiritual perspective is nasty going in, if you have a lot and your spiritual perspective
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.880]   is nasty, you're sinning.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.560]   If you have little and your spiritual perspective is nasty, you're sinning.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.320]   It's not the having or the not having.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   It's the devotion side.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   That's the point.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.920]   That's the point.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.560]   And so I'm humbled by this truth and I'm humbled by Apostle Paul who says, "What I'm trying
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.840]   to secure in you, I'm not trying to restrict you.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.920]   I'm not trying to restrain you.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.400]   Hey, all of you guys, no more marriage."
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.840]   That was the fault of Catholicism thinking, "Put those guys in the monastery.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.440]   The monks, the nuns can't marry.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.960]   The monks can't marry and then they're going to be holy."
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   Celibacy does not make you holy.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   That's a false view.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.160]   The ascetics who deny themselves, that doesn't make you holy.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   False view.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.040]   Apostle Paul reveals his heart to us and says, "What I'm trying to do is not to restrain
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   you.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.920]   What I'm trying to do is secure undivided devotion to God."
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   That's pretty profound.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   Guys, from a personal point of view for me too, isn't this the struggle?
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.720]   And I am struggling, like I feel like day by day with this.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.520]   I want to provide so much for my family.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.680]   I remember putting on Facebook like, "I'm going to be a man of God and love my wife
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.480]   and love my kids and I'm going to set the tone spiritually and I'm going to do this."
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:43.520]   I am ramped up to be the best husband and father that I can be.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.520]   But is it not our struggle that although that's a good and godly goal, we turn even those
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:53.000]   blessings into things that are hugely out of proportion in the spiritual realm?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Right?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.860]   And just to make my family happy, just to make my kids good, and right now I'm researching
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:03.020]   their educational program, right now I'm researching like maybe we should move and all those things
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.200]   are motivated by I want to provide for my family, right?
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.160]   But isn't the struggle, how do I prioritize that?
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.080]   How do I prioritize that where I'm managing my time so that God is still priority, God
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.320]   is still number one and I'm able to say with Apostle Paul, "I want to have a single
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.080]   minded devotion for God."
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.200]   And that single minded devotion is not just on paper, it's not just in my head, it's
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.400]   being applied into my life.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   How do we do that?
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.760]   That's the daily struggle.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.680]   And so I'm not going to go into detail about it like right now, but really that's why
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.760]   sometimes I feel like, you know, it makes sense to me why at the end of every letter
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.720]   of Apostle Paul, after describing a heart for God, he'll say, "So therefore be sober,
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.640]   be diligent, examine your heart, test the spirit, you know, keep accountable."
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:57.320]   And he's saying, "Do everything so that you can have a singular devotion to God."
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:03.240]   You know, by way of wrapping up, go back to verse eight where we started.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:12.160]   And Apostle Paul, you know, he says, "But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   it is good, it's good, he says, for them if they remain even as I."
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:24.840]   I'm thankful that Apostle Paul is a forerunner in many ways, an example.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.320]   And he's able to say this, not with like, you know, come on, if you're like a 23 year
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.480]   old who got married at like 23 right out of college, he's looking at like a four year
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.680]   old man who's single and, you know, just learning day by day to be content.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.120]   He's like, "Dude, you're so better off for being single, man."
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.560]   It's like, shut up, you know, you don't know nothing about it.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.880]   Apostle Paul says, "It's good, even as I."
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   Right?
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   Because he's single.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.280]   He didn't carry, you know, a family with him when he could and he says that, he says, "Do
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.800]   I not have a right to have a family like you guys?
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.240]   Do I not have a right to bring along a wife, a believing wife?"
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.400]   But for Apostle Paul, he's not asking us just to follow, "Even as I," in his singleness.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.560]   Because not everybody in here is meant for singleness.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.760]   Jesus Christ made that very clear, celibacy is a gift.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.400]   And if you don't have a gift and you try to force yourself to have a gift, you're not
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   really helping anybody.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   Okay?
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:23.680]   But what he is doing when he says, "Be like this, remain even as I," Apostle Paul is single
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.440]   minded and we need to be singularly minded for Christ.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.960]   That Apostle Paul, for him and his application, because I have been set apart for the gospel,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.440]   although I have the right, I'm not going to exercise my right.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.720]   Because I've been set apart for the gospel ministry and I have a purpose and I have a
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   goal and I'm being driven for that one goal to glorify God, anything that is going to
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.880]   prevent me, I will lay aside.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   Not because I have to, because it's good.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.480]   Because it's good.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   So many times in our lives, sometimes we ask this question, why can't we just have it all?
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.280]   Our generation wants the benefits of being single, the benefits of being married, we
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.400]   want it all.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.600]   We want all the opportunities and all the benefits.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.240]   Why can't we not have it all?
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.720]   Because it's not good.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.960]   Because sometimes we let go of what matters, we let go of the eternal, we let go of the
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   purpose.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.040]   That's what Apostle Paul is teaching us.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.160]   Learn to remain, learn to focus, learn to be single minded.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Amen?
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:28.280]   Let's close our eyes in prayer.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.680]   Father Lord, we pray that you would forgive us.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:36.000]   God, many times our perspective is just too small.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.480]   And God, the things that sometimes matter so much in our lives, we realize it only matters
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.760]   in a small little spectrum of things.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.360]   I pray Lord that you would continue to teach us that we would know the truth.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.120]   And Lord that by knowing the truth, we would truly be set free from the bondage of carrying
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.600]   and being invested so heavily into the things on earth.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.680]   But God, that we would learn to care about the weighty matters of God.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.280]   I pray Father God that you would continue to lead us and sanctify us, that you would
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.680]   give us the wisdom to willingly lay aside the things that prevent us from coming to
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.800]   you, to willingly lay aside the things that are hindering us from offering up ourselves
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.200]   fully to you.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.320]   But God, that continually as you sanctify us, we would take steps day by day, examining
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.440]   our walk, examining ourselves and the times, that God we might live a life honoring and
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.020]   pleasing to you.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.280]   This we pray in Christ's name.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:30.640]   Amen.
