[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   So, if you can turn your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, we're going to be taking a break
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.240]   from Romans for this week and then we'll pick it back up next week.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.560]   But 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, I'll be reading from verse 16 all the way down to verse 22.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.280]   And reading out of the NASB, "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.560]   In everything give thanks, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.200]   Do not quench the spirit, do not despise prophetic utterances, but examine everything carefully.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840]   Hold fast to that which is good.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.160]   Abstain from every form of evil."
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.280]   Let's pray.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.720]   Heavenly Father, we pray as we have gathered here together to worship you, more than just
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.040]   the time that we spend, more than just hearing of sermon, I pray that you would stir our
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   hearts that there would be a greater sensitivity to your presence.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.220]   We pray, Father God, for your word to do its work.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.520]   As you have ordained it, as you have breathed your very breath in it, help us, Lord God,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.240]   to meet with you, that we would hear your Son's voice and follow Him and Him alone.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.280]   Bless us this morning in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.720]   Well, as you guys know, this week is Thanksgiving.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.640]   Outside of the church, I don't even know if you ever even hear it.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   I've been saying this for years, maybe more than 10 years, that it seems like every year
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.920]   the holiday of Thanksgiving is less and less mentioned.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.840]   In fact, now, as soon as Halloween is over and all the candy stuff and children are done,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440]   it's like Christmas lights go up and they're ready for Christmas.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.840]   So Thanksgiving is kind of like blurred.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.480]   I don't know about you, but I just don't see it.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   I don't see it in the commercials.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.560]   I don't see it online.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.520]   It just seems like the world just doesn't know what to do with it.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.600]   It makes sense that it's been a while that they've been trying to take Christ out of
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.000]   Christmas.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.560]   So just to kind of like the way that they're dealing with or the world is dealing with
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.280]   Thanksgiving is like, "What is this day for?"
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.440]   And so instead of fighting against it, they're just kind of nullifying it.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.360]   And so now Thanksgiving is just a day before Black Friday.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.640]   That's how kind of everybody's gearing up for what are the deals and we're looking for
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   all of that.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.440]   And there's nothing wrong with wanting to find deals.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.160]   But again, this specific day of Thanksgiving, it's not ordained necessarily in Scripture
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.000]   to be once a year that we set aside a day that we're going to celebrate this Thanksgiving.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.480]   But as it has been designated and we are taking time off, I want to make sure that we don't
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.040]   just spend it like rest of the world.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.280]   Thanksgiving at the core of it, not just once a year, but at the core of what Thanksgiving
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.920]   is, it is directly related to our salvation.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.320]   Romans chapter one says, "In summary of man's rebellion," he says that, "man refused to
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.840]   give glory to God and rather than to give thanks to his own creation."
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.480]   And so the summation of man's rebellion is ingratitude toward God.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.960]   So the whole point of salvation was to restore where God ought to have been.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.280]   Instead of seeking our own glory in our own life and giving credit to ourselves is to
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.800]   recognize who God is.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.260]   And we couldn't do that from a distance.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.520]   So God forgave our sons, restored so that we can place him back where he ought to be,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.440]   the King of Kings and Lord of Lords over our lives.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.520]   But the question is, we're commanded to be thankful.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.720]   I know that many of you may have had a very difficult year, whether it was job, it was
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.920]   health, or family issues, whatever it may have been, financial.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.520]   How do you give thanks in that context?
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.320]   Do we just suck it up?
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.560]   Do we just pretend like it's not there and just ignore the hardship in our lives?
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.320]   Well, let me ask you a question.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.680]   This is a...I think this will help us to understand why Paul, and through the Holy Spirit, is
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.480]   commanding us to rejoice.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.600]   Imagine if your boss came into your work and you've had this job and you really love this
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.040]   job and he says, "I have good news and bad news.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   Which one do you want to hear?"
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.880]   So you're thinking through, "Okay, you know, I don't know what he's about to say."
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.840]   And he said, "Well, here's the bad news.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.480]   Bad news is you're fired.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.600]   You love this job.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   It's a really good paying job.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   And you love the commute.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.360]   You love the people there.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.600]   And you've had it for many years."
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.520]   And all of a sudden, he says, "You're fired and you're thinking through all of these things.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.840]   I'm not going to take care of my kids.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.960]   I just bought a house, you know, and you have all of these concerns."
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   He said, "It's the bad news."
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.680]   And all of a sudden, he's like, "What is wrong with this guy?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.440]   What could I have possibly done?"
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.120]   And then he says, "Well, here's the good news.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.560]   And the good news is the reason why I fired you is because our company won the lottery.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.040]   Remember, we've been paying $5 every week and the biggest lottery happened, $1.5 billion.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.100]   We were the winners.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.640]   So you don't need to work anymore.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.540]   So everybody is going to get $100 million.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.200]   And so therefore, you don't need to work."
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.880]   So all of a sudden, this good news turned into...
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   This good news supersedes all the other bad news.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.360]   Not only the bad news of you getting fired, but whatever bad news that you heard prior
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.480]   to that, this good news supersedes all of that.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.720]   The gospel itself, in Greek, euangelion, the literal understanding of it is good news.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.000]   And that's what we received and that's what we are to proclaim, this good news.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.240]   And this good news of the gospel supersedes any other bad news.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.200]   Because all of a sudden, it gives perspective that whatever bad things, whatever horrible
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.280]   things that has happened, it's only temporary.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.560]   And in fact, even the bad things that happened, God uses that to ultimately give us greater
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.400]   hope in Christ.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.440]   And so whatever bad news that you may have brought into this room, if you genuinely believe
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.920]   the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ, this good news supersedes any other bad news.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.480]   Even winning the lottery is only temporary.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.640]   It can only solve your financial problems, but it doesn't solve the problem of health,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.480]   life, family, relational issues.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.320]   But this good news of the gospel affects every aspect of our life.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.960]   And whatever bad news may have ruined your day, this good news reverses that curse of
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.240]   that bad news.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.720]   Paul commands the church and God commands us, commands us to rejoice, to pray without
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   ceasing, to in all circumstances give thanks.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   He's able to command us because these things are not related to our present circumstance,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   but an eternal hope that we have in Christ.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.280]   If you're not a believer, this will make absolutely no sense.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.240]   If you don't believe in the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you can't fake it.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.600]   You can fake fellowship, you can fake being nice, but you can't fake rejoicing.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.520]   And a lot of times Christians walk around thinking like, "Well, the Bible says to rejoice,
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.400]   so I got to put on a good face."
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.880]   Internally that's not what's going on, but externally you all say, "Everything's good.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.280]   God works all things for good."
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.920]   But in reality, that's not your experience.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   What I want to do this morning is look at the three imperatives of Paul, which in a
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.640]   sense summarizes Christian attitude.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.240]   This is what happens to a Christian when his eyes are open to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.080]   It is not something that you work toward.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.200]   It is not something that if you work hard and discipline that somehow you can get.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:57.480]   If you believe that you are the recipients of this good news, this is what happens.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.440]   First thing that he says, he says to rejoice always, to rejoice.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.320]   How do you just turn this on and off?
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   What does he mean by that?
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.360]   Jesus himself, when the angels declared the incarnation of Christ, when he was coming
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   as a child, the angels said in Luke 1.14, "You will have joy and gladness and many will
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.640]   rejoice at his birth."
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.960]   He says his incarnation is going to produce much joy to many people.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.040]   In fact, Jesus himself, he's talking about his death and resurrection.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.280]   This is how he describes it to his disciples.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.800]   Truly John 16.20, "Truly, truly I say to you that you will weep and lament," he's referring
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.500]   to his death, "but the world will rejoice.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.080]   You will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy."
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.400]   In other words, the byproduct of his death and resurrection is going to produce in you
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.520]   a joy, a joy that the world is not going to be able to understand.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   A joy that can only be produced if you genuinely believe that this good news is for you.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   Again, in John 16.22, "Therefore you too have grief now, but I will see you again and your
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.080]   heart will rejoice and no one will take your joy away from you."
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.360]   That this is not a joy that is affected by persecution.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.680]   This is not a joy that is affected by our circumstance.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.560]   No one could take that joy away from you.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.960]   And so that's how Jesus describes his death and resurrection.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:32.360]   So when he says in John 10.10, "I have come to bring life and to bring this life abundantly."
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.800]   What do you mean when you see somebody who is filled with life?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.760]   We say, "Wow, that guy is so filled with life."
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.000]   Do we mean that he's just very active?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.880]   He just can't sit still?
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.680]   I know plenty of people who are active and bitter and angry.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.920]   We don't say, "Well, that guy's filled with life."
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.240]   Actually when we say, "That guy's filled with life," we're talking about there's joy in
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   his life.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.320]   There's something about him.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.920]   That's exactly what Jesus means in John 10.10.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.800]   He doesn't mean that I have come to extend your biological life for eternity, which would
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.200]   be miserable for so many people.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.640]   Chris, your experience of physical life is so hard.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.800]   Why would you want that for eternity?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   That's not a gift.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.920]   If you're having a miserable time in this fallen world, why wouldn't you want your life
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.080]   to end?
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.360]   That's not what he's referring to.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.840]   When he says to give life, he's talking about Zoe, to be made alive in Christ.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:44.000]   So in other words, the description of salvation is to restore joy into a life of a Christian,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.560]   joy that was suffocated when we were separated from the author of life.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:54.140]   And so our whole salvation is described at restoring life back into people who are dead
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.240]   in their trespasses.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.640]   But this joy, this life is not based upon our circumstance.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.340]   And typically, every Thanksgiving we'll say, "Well, what are you thankful for?"
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.120]   And we'll say, "Well, I'm thankful for my friends, thankful for my health, thankful for
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.880]   my children, thankful for this new job, thankful for our business, thankful for the economy."
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.580]   We're thankful for various things, and all of these things are great indicators that
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.560]   maybe God is blessing our lives, possibly.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.560]   But the thankfulness, the joy that Paul is talking about here is not based upon our external
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.280]   circumstance.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.600]   In Hebrews 11, verse 1, it says, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.440]   conviction of things not seen."
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.200]   So faith is the assurance of this hope, this strong conviction of things that I can't see.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.080]   That's what faith is, and that's what connects us to God.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.800]   In Romans 12, it says, "To rejoice in," what?
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   "Hope."
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:04.320]   So, our rejoicing is directly related to hope, and hope is what we have because we have faith.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:12.200]   So if you do the math, basically, faith leads to joy.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.700]   Faith leads to life.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.080]   Faith leads to rejoicing because of hope, and this hope is not something that is based
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.000]   upon this world.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.160]   Even if everything in this external world comes crashing down around us, he said that
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.640]   this joy is not based upon our circumstance.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:39.160]   See, when he says to rejoice always, how can you rejoice always when things are falling
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.960]   apart, when things aren't happening the way you want, when your children are not the way
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.560]   that you desire, or your marriage, or your work, or whatever it may be?
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:13:00.360]   He can't possibly command us to rejoice always if our rejoicing is circumstantial.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.960]   What he is talking about, he's talking about a rejoicing that is beyond our circumstance.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.860]   Paul is not commanding this to the Thessalonian church because they didn't have any problems.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.640]   He started this letter for Thessalonians because they were a model church.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.280]   He was basically chased out of the city because the persecution was so intense, and that's
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.880]   how they end up going to Berea where we happened.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.540]   But the reason why he got to Berea is because the persecution was so intense.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.760]   He was only there for a short period of time, and he bore a lot of fruit, and he had to
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.040]   run away to get away from the persecution.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.320]   And then so he was writing this letter concerned that Satan might have come back in and ruined
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.640]   their faith.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.400]   And then Timothy comes back and with this great news that this church is thriving, but
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.200]   it's not because they didn't have problems, because in this letter he writes concerning
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:58.240]   fornication, because they were just a few months ago, they were idol worshippers.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.000]   So they had sexual immorality that was also in the church.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.080]   They had habitual laziness because some of them took the grace of God and said, "Well,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.500]   if God is gracious and he's going to come and save us, then why do we need to work?"
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.760]   So he had to address certain people who were lazy.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   There were doctrinal errors.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.840]   Satanic teaching that was coming in and saying, "Resurrection already happened, so there is
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.680]   no hope for you since you got left behind."
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.560]   And so Paul had to address false doctrines.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.600]   People were forming social groups.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.220]   The rich were staying with the rich, and poor were staying with the poor.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:35.000]   So these are problems that we would think a lot of churches have, and it wasn't because
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.160]   that they didn't have problems.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.920]   He was reminding this church in the context of intense persecution, relational issues,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:52.380]   doctrinal errors, sexual immorality, that in the context of all of this, he says, "Rejoice."
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.600]   Not because all your problems are taken care of, but because the hope that we have in Christ
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.000]   cannot be taken from us.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.240]   Every single one of us, when we were born, the moment that we were born, we were born
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.760]   with an instinct to live.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.120]   And that was surprising to me.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.920]   Again, when the doctor gives your first child to you, it's amazing how the baby comes out
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.320]   already sucking.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.560]   There was no class on sucking.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.760]   You weren't born and sent you to a class and showed you a video and said, "This is how
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   you drink milk."
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.720]   And you just start puckering and start sucking, and then that's how you get the milk, and
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   that's how you're going to live.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.480]   And then when you have enough, you poo.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.360]   You put pressure, and then you poo, and then you do that repeatedly over and over again,
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.560]   take a nap, and then you live.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.360]   No one was taught that.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.200]   We were born, and the moment that we were born, we were born with the instinct to live,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.600]   to eat, to poo, to sleep, to rest, whatever it is.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.760]   So that natural instinct to live is the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian, because
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.840]   a non-Christian finds life in this world.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.200]   They find joy, and they find purpose and meaning in the world.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:15.160]   So a Christian, once his eyes became open, saw that life is in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.140]   And so we find joy in Christ.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.580]   We find joy in Him.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.420]   And so therefore, we became followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.240]   Our life is not found in this world, and that's the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.840]   A Christian and a non-Christian is somebody who decided to come to church and read the
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   Bible every day.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.920]   A non-Christian can do that.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.720]   I know plenty of PhDs who studied the Bible and very antagonistic toward the things of
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   Christ.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.440]   There's a lot of people who spend a lot more time meditating and praying than Christians.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   Go to a Hindu temple.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.040]   Go to a Buddhist temple.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.520]   The distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is that he finds life in Christ,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.720]   and that's why he says he commands us to rejoice.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.640]   In Romans 8.18, Paul says, "I consider that the suffering of this present time are not
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.360]   worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us."
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.400]   He says, "in comparison."
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:20.360]   In comparison to the glory, everything else doesn't seem that bad.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:28.680]   If you don't believe this, if you don't truly believe that you are recipients of this good
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.400]   news, not just the theory, not just that you went to church, not just that you grew up
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.360]   in the church, but you genuinely believe that you are the recipient of this greatest spiritual
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:47.280]   lottery, then all of this stuff is theory, and you could force yourself to be joyful.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.920]   I should be feeling more joy.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.080]   I should be attracted to Christ, but I just am not because it's just a theory.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   The prerequisite of all of this is that you actually believe, and you've actually seen
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.680]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.560]   In Romans 8.31-35, and this is a passage that, again, I've quoted many times.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.840]   Many of you may have memorized it.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.880]   It's probably one of the many favorite verses in Romans, where Paul says, "What then shall
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.200]   we say to these things?
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.880]   If God is for us, who is against us?
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.280]   He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also with
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.120]   him freely give us all things?"
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   Again, why would you be concerned about the affairs of this world when you know that if
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:41.280]   God loved you enough to send his only begotten son, why would he withhold any good thing?
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.820]   If finances is what's best for you, why would he withhold that from you?
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.560]   If friendship is the primary thing that you need, why would a God who is willing to send
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.040]   his only begotten son, sacrifice him for you, why would he withhold any good thing from
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.360]   you?
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.240]   Who will bring a charge against God's elect?
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.560]   God is the one who justifies.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.160]   Who is the one who condemns?
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.720]   Christ Jesus is he who died.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.000]   Yes, rather, who was raised.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.480]   Who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.920]   Who will separate us from the love of Christ with tribulation, distress, or persecution,
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.200]   or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.080]   I know this is not a passage that's new to many of you, but every year that I read and
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.760]   meditate on this passage, it has more meaning.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.680]   The reason why it has more meaning is every year that I live, I am more and more aware
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.840]   how fragile everything else is in this world.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:44.680]   Your friendship, even with your children, your marriage, your bank account, your health,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   your life, your business, whatever it may be.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.880]   The longer I live, the more I am reminded just how fragile everything is in this fallen
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   world.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.200]   And anything that you have put confidence in, if that's your greatest source of joy,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.300]   is anything outside of Christ, that which you made your greatest joy ends up becoming
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.800]   the source of your greatest despair.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.400]   Let me say that again.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.220]   Anything that you have placed above to make it your greatest joy, it may be your children,
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.440]   it may be your wife, it may be your business, your bank account, whatever it may be, anything
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.440]   that you have placed as your greatest joy in life eventually becomes your greatest source
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.840]   of despair.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.000]   If marriage is what you pursue as your greatest joy, that will become the source of your greatest
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   despair.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.440]   If your children is a source of your greatest joy, that will one day become the source of
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.560]   your greatest despair.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.880]   That's the irony of the cruelty of this world.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:52.280]   And so when he says, "I command you to rejoice and to rejoice always," it's because our joy
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:59.560]   is founded upon this hope, this hope in Christ, that no matter how difficult this circumstance
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.840]   and no matter how ugly this year may have been physically, that this hope in Christ
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.440]   can never be taken away because it's not based upon me, it's not based upon you, it's not
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.400]   based upon your will, it's not based upon your discipline, it's not based upon your
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.440]   fruit.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.120]   It's based upon the love of Christ.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.960]   He who did not spare his own son, why will he not along with him give us all things?
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.320]   Along with that, he says, "Rejoice always, and if you find life in Christ and that's
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.760]   where your rejoicing happens," he says, "then pray without ceasing."
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.640]   The question that we have to ask ourselves, "What does pray without ceasing look like?
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.080]   Should I always be closing my eyes?
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.840]   How do I drive if I do this?"
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.360]   What about studying the Bible if we're praying without ceasing?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.760]   What about fellowship and evangelism?
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.440]   When does that happen if we're always praying?
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:59.280]   You have to understand, again, in context, there are several words in the Bible that's
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.080]   translated for prayer.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.680]   There's "euchomai," "erotaio," "deomai," and every one of these things are slightly nuanced
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.080]   different, but in the end it just means to have desire.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.760]   To have desire, you beseech and you're asking, petitioning, and so it has similar meaning,
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760]   right?
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.320]   And translated slightly different from passage to passage.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:29.600]   But the primary word that has been translated for prayer in the New Testament is "prosechomai."
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.840]   And that's the primary word that is used for prayer.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.040]   And again, helping understanding what this word is and the nuance behind it will help
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.800]   us understand why he's saying, "Pray always."
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:48.400]   The word is a compound word with "pros" as a preposition denoting closeness or going
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.080]   towards something.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.400]   "Euchai" is a Greek word that means to petition, to desire.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:03.760]   So to have these two words together, to pray means to recognize that our desire is met
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.440]   in Christ.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.920]   So when you have this desire and when you are in need of something, that you draw near
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.920]   to Him.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.920]   That's what prayer is.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.960]   So prayer isn't this religious activity of closing your eyes and having a list of prayer
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.520]   concerns, and then we pray for Him, pray for Him, pray for this, pray for that, and then
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.960]   we're done.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.440]   Primary understanding of praying is that our longing is satisfied in Him.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.880]   That's what prayer is, to draw near.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.800]   What's interesting, again, the word, the primary word for worship is "proskenaio."
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.640]   The word "pros" in the same word is "prosechomai."
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   And the word "proskenaio" means to draw near to God and be prostrated, to kiss Him in adoration
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.720]   and reverence and in fear.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:57.880]   So the word for worship also has the idea of coming to Him.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.360]   You can't worship God from a distance.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.680]   The very word itself means to come.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.960]   That's why when Jesus comes, the first thing that He says to His disciples is what?
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   "Come.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.600]   Come to me."
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.640]   And this is something that God could not say to the Israelites in the Old Testament.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.720]   If you go to the Old Testament, He says to come, but He says, "When you come, make sure
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.520]   you do all of this."
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.480]   And if you listen carefully to everything that God tells them to do in the book of Leviticus,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.800]   you don't hear "come."
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.400]   If you've been studying through us in the book of Leviticus, the end conclusion of the
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.000]   book of Leviticus isn't "come."
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.280]   The end conclusion of Leviticus is, "You better stay away, because if you don't do exactly,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.440]   exactly what I tell you to do, curse will be upon you."
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.720]   So in one sense, He says to come and make sure you do all of this when you come, but
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.920]   if you don't do it the way I tell you, you're going to die.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.080]   See, they couldn't come to Him.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.980]   They couldn't come to Him by their own righteousness, and no animal ever washed away their sins.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.800]   It was only to point to the coming of Christ, where Christ was going to fulfill all of that.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.880]   So in the Old Testament, this holy God, in order to just even be in their presence, all
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.440]   of that ritual, day after day, morning and night, had to be done.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.900]   Every single day, every single week, every single month, every single year, every decade,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.900]   it had to be done.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.560]   Sacrifice, killing, over and over and over again.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.720]   He says, "Only that way you can come even close, and even then, you can't come all the
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.900]   way.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.800]   You can only come to a certain point, and that's it."
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:48.280]   Yet when Christ comes, veiled, His glory veiled in His humanity, He comes and says, "Now come.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.200]   Now come."
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.800]   And so the disciples follow Him, and they go where He goes.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:01.060]   And then when He's crucified on the cross, the curtain is torn, and He says, "Now come."
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.200]   And that's the whole point of salvation, that we couldn't get to Him.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.600]   And so Jesus says to come, and in the book of Hebrews it says, "Now you can come to the
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.880]   throne of grace with confidence."
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:20.760]   That was the whole point of salvation, and that was the whole point of prayer.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.440]   We make prayer like the way that the Jews practice the Sabbath, that we say, "Well,
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.080]   if we did all of these things, if we don't do all these things, then we kept the Sabbath."
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.560]   And Jesus says, "Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.600]   The Sabbath wasn't meant so that you can work hard to keep it.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.200]   Sabbath was given to you so that you can rest.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.040]   The Lord is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath."
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.560]   And oftentimes, the way that we look at prayer is that prayer is another discipline of many
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.320]   other disciplines that we need to do and make a list, and we need to do it, and then we're
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:27:00.760]   so burdened by prayer, not realizing prayer is the primary gift of salvation.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.440]   But because of what He has done, He said, "Now come.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.720]   Come to find life in Christ.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.920]   Now you can come."
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.800]   You couldn't come before because of what He has done, because of our own sins.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   He says to come.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.040]   You ever think about Jesus?
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.000]   Oftentimes we hear teachings about how Jesus broke away from the crowd because He needed
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.120]   to rejuvenate and really pray and depend on God to empower Him so that He can go and work,
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.080]   and all of that is true.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.320]   And so we say, "Yeah, we need to pray too.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.760]   We need to go like Jesus and be an example, and we need to be prayer warriors," and all
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   that is true.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:50.160]   But you ever think that maybe Jesus went to pray with the Father because that's where
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   He just wanted to be?
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.200]   You ever think that Jesus broke away from the crowd because everybody wanted something
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.440]   from Him?
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:05.400]   The only place where He really found rest was with the Father, where God was ministering
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.720]   to Him, and that's where He found life?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:16.440]   See, if we find life in this world, whenever we have issues and problems, we find human
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   answers.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   You have financial problems?
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   Go to the bank.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   Are you sick?
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   Go to the doctor.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   You're lonely?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   Find some friends, community.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Something's not working right?
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   Say, "I'm one of those people.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   I'm determined.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.440]   I'm going to write down the pros and cons, and I'm going to use my intellect, my experience,
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   and I'm going to do all this.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   I'm going to get this done."
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:45.240]   If our life and our value system is found in this world, that's what we turn to when
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.240]   we are squeezed.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:53.760]   See, but when He says to pray without ceasing, it means that the door has been opened.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.280]   The door has been opened to Him.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.320]   It says, "You have my ear."
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.760]   A couple of weeks ago, Pastor James Yim gave a powerful sermon about adoption.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.480]   He says, "The point of salvation is now we're adopted children of God, co-heirs with Christ."
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.320]   In other words, he's saying, "You have my ear.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.540]   I am listening to you.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.060]   Why would you run to a counselor?
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.440]   Why would you run to something else?
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.080]   Why would you run to the world when you have my ear?"
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:30.640]   So the greatest benefit of salvation is that the door to the throne of grace has been opened.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.880]   But here's the catch.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.200]   This is not something you earn.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.920]   This is not something that you work on.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.520]   This is something that happens because you believe.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.800]   You believe.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:50.480]   If you believe, life is found in Christ, and that's where you find your greatest joy.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:57.160]   See, if church is simply an obligation, if Bible study is simply an obligation that a
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:03.480]   Christian does, eventually, eventually you will follow wherever you find the greatest
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   joy.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.880]   You find the greatest joy in the world, that's where you go.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:14.640]   You'll pretend in the church, but you'll pursue the world outside of the church.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.360]   Because we're naturally, instinctively, God created us to live.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360]   Instinctively we are sucking.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.960]   We're spiritually sucking for food.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Every single one of us.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   I mean, physically, we've become masters at eating.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.320]   But spiritually, like where do you find food?
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   Where do you find satisfaction?
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.740]   Where do you find joy?
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.800]   If you find that in this world, you can pretend and put on a good face at church, but as soon
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.840]   as no one is looking, you're in the world.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   You're in the TV, you're in Netflix, you're in traveling, you're in whatever it is that
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.360]   the world is causing you to feel joy.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.240]   That's why he says to pray, when he says to pray unceasingly, that's what he means.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.200]   To come to him constantly.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.480]   That the longing that God has placed in your heart, that you would find it in Christ, in
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Christ alone.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.040]   To continue to come to him, not just Sunday, not only during prayer time, not only Bible
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.240]   study and discussion time, but all of our life.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.960]   Just like you pursue, if you like surfing, if you like eating, if you like traveling,
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.840]   just like you go to that because it feels good.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.160]   And you feel alive when you do that.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.440]   That you find greater life when you're in Christ, and so that causes you to be a pursuer
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.720]   of Christ.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.000]   You can see how easily we can be deceived in the church.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.560]   Because we are in the church, we're in Bible study, we're studying, we're leading, and
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.480]   then we pretend like we find life in Christ, we sing about life in Christ, but is it really
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.680]   the case?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:58.560]   Is that really your testimony?
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.400]   Do you see him as your life?
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.680]   Do you rejoice more over the bank account?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   Do you rejoice more over your friends?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.040]   Do you rejoice more over circumstance?
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.240]   Do you rejoice more over your vacations and where you are capable of going or not going?
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.960]   Do you rejoice more over your marriage?
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.460]   Do you rejoice more over your children?
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.640]   Or is your life in Christ first and foremost?
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.360]   That's what it means to pray unceasingly, to come to him.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.800]   And as a result of that, you give thanks to all things.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.280]   And that's where Thanksgiving comes in.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.400]   If our Thanksgiving is circumstantial, some of you guys have a lot to be thankful for,
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.420]   some of you guys don't have much to be thankful for this year.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.040]   Maybe hopefully next year it'll be better.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.520]   Maybe the year after that would be better, if it's circumstantial.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:50.280]   But he's commanding us to be thankful in all circumstance because it doesn't hinge upon
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.040]   what happened this year.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.280]   Christian thankfulness and Christian rejoicing and Christian prayer and drawing to him is
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:05.080]   not circumstantial because it's based upon and hinged upon the firm rock of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.940]   That's why he's in Habakkuk, chapter 3, verse 17, 18, it says, "Though the fig tree should
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.880]   not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olives should fail
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.240]   and the fields produce no food, though the flock should be cut off from the fold and
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.840]   there be no cattle in the stalls, yet I will exult in the Lord.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.740]   I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:32.360]   Is my worship, is my walk with God circumstantial?
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   Or is it really upon him?"
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:43.040]   So I want to ask you, when you examine your life, how much of your rejoicing is based
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.680]   upon your friends?
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.280]   How much of your rejoicing is based upon your family?
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.000]   How much of your rejoicing is based upon circumstance?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.640]   How much of your rejoicing is based upon how loved you feel by your friends?
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.040]   Or is it really the good news?
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.880]   Has the good news of Jesus Christ superseded any other bad news?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.180]   That's why he says, after he says all that, I think he commands him to be thankful in
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:22.480]   all situations, he says, "Not to quench the spirit.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.440]   Do not despise the prophetic utterances.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.520]   Abstain from every form of evil."
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.280]   Because God has already given us the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit came to convict
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.640]   the world of sin, which he did for us, and to remind us of everything that he has said
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.080]   and done.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.000]   And what is what he has said and done?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.480]   It's the gospel, it's the good news.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:46.800]   And so he said the Holy Spirit has been implanted in us, given to us, in order to remind us
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.700]   and intercede for us about the good news.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.380]   And that's why he says, "Do not quench the Holy Spirit."
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:03.320]   Because the Holy Spirit is already praying on our behalf, interceding on our behalf with
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:10.040]   groanings that our words cannot express, so that we can constantly recognize and to what?
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.000]   To rejoice, to come to him, to be thankful.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.460]   Let me conclude with this, because our primary struggle isn't necessarily theology.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:31.600]   I would assume majority of you, I'm sure it's not 100%, but majority of you are here because
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.440]   you confessed faith in Christ, you believed him.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.560]   At least you confessed it.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.980]   But within that confession, there are some of you who don't really believe.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.940]   You confess it, it's more of kind of a security blanket, like, "If God is real, I don't want
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.940]   to go to hell."
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.620]   So it's nothing more than that, it's a security blanket.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:55.220]   And if you can find that security blanket in the temple, in Buddhists, and maybe one
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.620]   day you might go there.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.420]   So it's not real faith.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.060]   And then there are some of us who profess faith and you genuinely believe.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.020]   So it's not a theological issue for you.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:17.220]   But you haven't experienced life in Christ in a long time.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.060]   You've been pursuing the world and you've been distracted and all the principles and
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.620]   the lures of this world has tempted you and gripped your mind and your heart and you're
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.260]   constantly in the middle.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.380]   When you hear good sermons or Bible study, you're like, "Yes!"
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.460]   And then as soon as it's over, you're seeking the world.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.020]   John Piper says this in his book, A Hunger for God, a book of fasting.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.980]   And then let me conclude with this.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.980]   The greatest enemy of hunger for God is not poison but apple pie.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:52.680]   It is not the banquet of the wicked that dulls our appetite for heaven, but endless nibbling
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.300]   at the table of the world.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:01.780]   It is not the X-rated video, but the prime time dribble of triviality we drink in every
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.140]   night.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.940]   That's where the rubber meets the road for most of us.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:16.620]   We're so distracted and so filled with the things of this world that we don't bring an
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.540]   appetite for the things of Christ when we come.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.500]   And so we desire it mentally.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.340]   But in our heart, in our spirit, there's very little room.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:34.660]   So he says, "For all the ill that Satan can do, when God describes what keeps us from
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:42.420]   the banquet table of his love, it is a piece of land, a yoke of oxen, and a wife."
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.500]   He's talking about the parable in Luke chapter 14.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.780]   That's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.460]   We can talk about how we want to be great for the kingdom of God and how we want to
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.140]   evangelize and want to do all these great things for our lives.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.660]   We dedicate our lives, we follow the earth of Christ.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:06.780]   But if we do not address the nibbling that we do on a daily basis in this world, which
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:12.580]   quenches the spirit, there is no appetite for things of God.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.220]   And that might be the reason why you haven't rejoiced in him in a long time.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.620]   And that's why, that might be the reason why you don't go to him when you are squeezed.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:31.260]   And that's why your thankfulness, you can only think of physical circumstance.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.860]   So as we celebrate Thanksgiving, let's be mindful and deliberate that we don't celebrate
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.900]   and go down the path like the rest of the world, that we practice joy and prayer and
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.700]   thankfulness as Paul describes it here.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.220]   Maybe take some time to fast.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.300]   I mean, Thanksgiving is about gorging.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.300]   Let's do something different.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   Maybe fast.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.500]   It doesn't have to be food.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.620]   Fast at nibbling.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.660]   What are you doing that's distracting you from things of God?
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:04.500]   Maybe take some time to fast away from that and ask the Lord to restore a hungering and
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:10.340]   thirsting for him that you had at one point so that our natural desire would be him above
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.380]   everything else.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.300]   To ask ourselves this week this question, what causes you to rejoice?
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.940]   What causes you to come to him and what are you thankful for?
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.100]   Let's take some time to pray as we welcome our worship team to come back.
