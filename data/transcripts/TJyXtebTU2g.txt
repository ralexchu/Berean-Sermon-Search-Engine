[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.800]   and happy Lord's Day.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.300]   As always, it is such a privilege and such a joy
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   for us to gather together to worship our God,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   and to hear his word this morning,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.300]   and praise God because of Christ,
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   because of what he has done,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   that we can come and gather,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   we can have access to the living God.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   And so as we come this morning to sing and to worship,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   let us come with reverence and with joy,
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   as we remember, as we proclaim,
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.300]   as we make much of his greatness,
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   his kindness and mercy towards us,
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.800]   and his amazing grace.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.300]   So would you join us this morning as we begin with worship?

[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   Welcome to Bryn Community Church.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   We have actually quite a few announcements
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   before we get started.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   So let me get started by,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   there's going to be a change in parking.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   So right now we have designated across the street
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   the Lyon parking as like family parking,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   but we're gonna be switching that to family parking
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   to be behind us.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   The Kimco parking,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   that's attached to our building behind us.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   And this is for families with small children.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   So if your children are already grown up and married,
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   that doesn't count.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   So for families who have small children
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   that you have to put them in strollers
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   or you're kind of hard to kind of cross the street,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   again, we're doing this so that
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   we try to minimize the traffic of young children
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   crossing the street.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.720]   So it'll be here, so it'll be easier.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   For safety reasons, we're doing that.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   So if you are a young adult or you're married,
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   but your children are grown up,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   or if you have bad knees,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   I mean, you'll be okay for that, okay?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   But otherwise, we're gonna be reserving that
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   for young families with small children,
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   and then the other parking will be open for everybody else.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   So just keep that in mind, starting from next Sunday.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   So our parking volunteers
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   are gonna be directing traffic over there.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   So if they ask you,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   if you're, again, family with young children,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   they'll probably direct you to that parking lot over there.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   This coming Saturday, we have Men's Ministry Fellowship.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   That's happening at 9 a.m.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   Typically, a lot of times,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   a lot of the men kind of sign up last minute,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   maybe something's going on, and you don't know yet,
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   but because we need to order food and meat,
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   and we have our sisters are volunteering
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   to cook the food for us,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   and so they need a solid number
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   of how many people are coming.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   So if you haven't signed up and you're planning to come

[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   We need to put you in groups,
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   and we need to make sure that we order enough food
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   for the people that are coming.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   So please sign up by today, if possible,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   so that we'll know to be able to have that number.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   So this coming Saturday at 9 a.m. in the cafe, okay?
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   Family Ministry Community Groups,
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   that's gonna be starting next Sunday.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   So if you haven't signed up,
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   it's an opportunity to just--
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   to fellowship with other family members,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   and you'll be teamed up with two or three other families,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   and you'll be assigned to kind of go out
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   and fellowship with them.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   It's happening September 10th, October 8th, November 5th.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   So if you haven't signed up, you want to sign up,
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   please sign up for that.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   Jubilee Group--so if you are 50 or older,
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   this ministry is for you, Jubilee,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   and Elder Phillip is in charge of that.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   On September 17th, 2020--
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   at 2023--12:45 p.m.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   I'm just reading what's here.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   12:45 p.m., so there's gonna be a lunch fellowship
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   happening after service, so if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   please sign up for that.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   So if you're 50 and over, this ministry is for you.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   Next, membership class is happening on September 10th,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   and so if you are planning to take the membership class
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   at church, it's an 8-week course
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   that takes place at 9 o'clock on Sunday morning,
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   and it goes over the fundamental doctrines of Christianity,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   ministry philosophy of our church.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   You'll be able to interact with the leaders of our church
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   'cause they all take turns teaching different classes.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   So if you are planning to become a member,
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   this is the class that you'll need to sign up.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   So I think today is the last day for the last session
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   for the membership class, and then the new one
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   is gonna be starting on October 1st, okay?
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   All right, I got just a few more.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   BBA--so Borean Basketball Association--
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   so that's starting up again,
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   so if you are planning to play,
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   the sign-ups are starting today.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   I think there is a table set up outside today
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   and then all the way up to next Sunday
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   and then Sunday after.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   You have three Sundays to sign up,
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   and the first day is gonna start on October 1st, okay?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   And that's happening--I forget what time it is,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   but it's happening on Sunday evenings,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   around 4 or 5 o'clock, and then those of you
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   who have bad knees or you have bad back
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   or you're just not good,
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   there's a half-court tournament for you as well,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   so if you just want to come and fellowship,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   you don't have to be that good.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   It's a great opportunity to kind of interact
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   with other brothers and sisters.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   There is a separate league for the sisters.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   I got yelled at for not mentioning them,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   so I want to make sure.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   Ashley, I'm mentioning it, okay?
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   So you can sign up, whether you're sisters or brothers,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   if you want to just come and just have fun,
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   and even if you don't play,
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   it's a great opportunity to come and interact
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   with brothers and sisters, and it's a quick way
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   to kind of get to know more people.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   So that's happening on Sunday afternoons,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   and so the sign-ups are beginning today.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   I forgot to mention this for the first service,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   but our India trip medical missions is confirmed.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   The dates are confirmed that it's gonna be
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   January 26th to February 3rd, okay?
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   So we already have a lot of returning people
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   who are coming, so it's just--we only have
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   a few more spots open, so if you're interested,
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   and you probably need to tell me as soon as possible,
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   because we don't have that many spots.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   I just wanted to open it up to you,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   let you know that they're taking it.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   You do not have to be a doctor in the medical field.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   They do need assistance in other things.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   If you happen to be an eye doctor,
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   eye doctor in particular, I think there is--
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   we would need more of that, but outside of that,
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   you're welcome to sign up, and again,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   if you do sign up and you've already signed up,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   you'll probably be getting an email from me
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   sometime this week to set up our first meeting,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   so I'm just giving you a heads-up for that, okay?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   One last thing.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   As I mentioned last week,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   we have the Korean orphaned children.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   Technically, they're not orphaned,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   but we're gonna, for the sake of clarity, identify them.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   That group is coming in this Thursday,
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   and then our college department is kind of heading that up,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   and they're gonna be taking care of them
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   and assisting them while they're here,
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   and then they're gonna be leaving on Saturday.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   So we won't be able to physically meet them,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   but as I mentioned before, this is a group of kids,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   about 50, 55 of them,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   who are supported by the government out in Korea,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   and it barely pays for the workers,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   just room and board, and that's about it,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   and as I mentioned last week, when we asked them,
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   you know, in what way can we help out,
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   and basically the director said, you know,
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   "These kids have never eaten out before,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   "so just taking them out to eat or getting a hamburger
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   "would be a huge treat for them."
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   So that kind of gives you an idea
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   that the limitations that they have because of funds.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   So we are collecting offering for them
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   so that they can use for after-school programs
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   or even if it's just to do something extracurricular
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   outside of just going to school.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   So if you have a heart to give,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   make sure when you're giving that you designate that
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   specifically for the orphan that's coming,
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   and then we'll make sure that that goes to them
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   when they show up, okay?
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   So let me pray for us and give you a minute
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   to give your offering, and then, again,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   those of you who brought physical offering,
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   there's a box in the back on the way out, all right?
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   Let me pray for us.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   Father, we thank you so much for your patience,
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   your love, your sacrifice.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   Lord, it truly is beyond comprehension
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.720]   how much patience, Lord God, that you have toward us.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize the gift that we have in you
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   so that our worship would be an overflow of gratitude
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   in our hearts.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   Help us, Lord, whether it's in giving, singing,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   worshiping, whatever it is that we're doing,
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   that it would be an expression
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   of all the things that you've already done,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   a recognition of who you are,
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.720]   and our great desire, Lord God,
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   to meet you face to face.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   So we pray that you would multiply this giving,
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   multiply these funds, Lord God.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   May it be used to maximize the spreading of your gospel
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   and your glory.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   We thank you, Father, in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.100]   Come before him with joyful singing.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.980]   Know that the Lord himself is God.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.900]   It is he who has made us and not we ourselves.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.980]   We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.020]   Enter his gates with thanksgiving
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.860]   and his courts with praise.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.420]   Give thanks to him, bless his name.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.820]   For the Lord is good.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.340]   His loving kindness is everlasting
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.960]   and his faithfulness to all generations.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.340]   Church family, would you please stand
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.640]   as we continue our worship and to give thanks.

[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:42.940]   - If you can turn your Bible with me to Luke chapter six.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.940]   I was thinking that we're gonna be finishing up today,
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.940]   but I think I didn't finish for the first service,
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.940]   so most likely not today either.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.940]   But next week for sure, we'll be wrapping up our series
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.940]   in the 12 disciples.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.940]   Let me read from verse 12 to 16.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.940]   It was at this time that he went off to the mountain to pray
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.940]   and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   And when day came, he called his disciples to him
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.940]   and chose 12 of them whom he also named as apostles.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.940]   Simon whom he also named Peter and Andrew, his brother,
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.940]   and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew,
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Aphaeus,
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.940]   Simon who was called the zealot, Judas the son of James,
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.940]   and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.940]   Let's pray.
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:35.940]   Father, give us insight, not only of your mind,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.940]   but your heart.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   Help us, Lord God, to glean
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   all that you have intended in these words.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.940]   Help us to learn, help us to be challenged, rebuked,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.940]   to be sobered and encouraged.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.940]   That we may continue to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.940]   Guide us and lead us by your word and by your spirit.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.940]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   I think within the last few years,
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.940]   I think, without mentioning names,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.940]   I think many of us, if you've been paying attention,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.940]   there's a lot of people who have been huge figures
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.940]   in the Christian faith.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.940]   And some of their faith have fallen out
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.940]   because of backsliding, adultery, sexual sin,
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.940]   and some just kind of walked away from their faith.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.940]   If you're a new Christian, the thought of somebody
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.940]   who had such influence and to just fall from their faith,
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.940]   it may be shocking to you.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.940]   Those of you who've been around for a while,
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.940]   you've been a Christian for 10, 15, 20, 30 years,
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.940]   you probably have many stories, like I do,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.940]   people that you've known,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.940]   maybe some people that you've looked up to.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   Maybe it was a former pastor, a small group leader,
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.940]   who's no longer walking with God,
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   and you may have asked, how could that happen to him?
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.940]   What happened?
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   Why did this happen?
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.940]   Were they true believers to begin with?
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.940]   You know, one of the most shocking statements
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   that Jesus made during his ministry,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   at least to me, in Matthew 7, 21 to 23,
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.940]   he warned, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.940]   "will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.940]   "but he who does the will of my Father,
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.940]   "Father who is in heaven, will enter."
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   And then in verse 22, he says,
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   "Many will say to me on that day."
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.940]   Not just a few, he said, "Many will say to me on that day,
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.940]   "'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy?'"
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   These aren't just Christians who are sitting in the back,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.940]   who kind of, you know, when the judgment day comes,
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.940]   like, I knew it, I knew he was going to church,
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.940]   and he did this and that, but there was clear evidence
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.940]   that they weren't believers,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.940]   and they were just going through the motions.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.940]   That's not who he's referring to.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.940]   He's referring to people calling him, "Lord, Lord."
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.940]   They prophesied in his name,
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.940]   and in your name, cast out demons.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.940]   So these were not just average Christians.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.940]   These were probably leaders.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.940]   Cast out demons, and in your name, perform many miracles.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.940]   I mean, today, if you saw somebody perform a miracle,
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   casting out demons, preaching the gospel,
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.940]   you would automatically think,
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.940]   "Clearly, that's anointed man of God,
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.940]   "and God's doing great work through him."
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.940]   And yet, he says, in verse 23,
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.940]   "And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.'"
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.940]   Despite all of that, he says, "I never knew you.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.940]   "Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness."
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.940]   I remember the first time I came across this text,
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   and I read this over and over and over again,
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.940]   because I couldn't understand,
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.940]   how can somebody who was prophesying,
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.940]   performing, casting out demons, performing miracles,
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:57.940]   preaching the gospel, and yet, he never knew him?
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   None of that had anything to do with me.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.940]   What a scary thought to be in this position.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.940]   And obviously, this would include missionaries.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   This would include pastors and leaders.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   If it includes them, obviously, it would include all of you.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.940]   Like, after all of that, he says, "I never knew you."
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   The greatest example of this passage is Judas.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.940]   Of the 12 that were handpicked by Christ,
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:35.940]   Judas ended up selling Christ for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.940]   We don't know a whole lot about Judas, his family background.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   Anytime somebody does something horrific,
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.940]   you want to study what their background,
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.940]   what did they believe before.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.940]   There's not a whole lot that is stated about his background.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.940]   The only thing that we know is that he was the only one
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.940]   that didn't come from the Galilee region.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.940]   So he was the only one who was an outsider out of the 12.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   Other than that, there's nothing that you could have seen coming.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:05.940]   There's some clear evidence that this guy was going to betray Christ.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.940]   Judas, after the effect, after looking at it,
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.940]   every time you see a list of the disciples,
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.940]   Peter is always number one, and Judas is always the last one.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   And whenever Judas is mentioned, it always qualifies,
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.940]   "This is the one who betrayed Christ."
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.940]   To clearly identify what happened to him.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   And it serves as a warning to anyone who studies the Gospels,
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:34.940]   that even an apostle of Christ that was handpicked by Christ,
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.940]   at the end of his life, he ended up betraying him,
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:42.940]   and then selling him out for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.940]   In fact, the very last thing that the Bible says about Judas in Acts 1.18,
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:54.940]   that after he betrays him, sees his master crucified, he feels guilty.
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.940]   And as a result of that, it says, "He hung himself,
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.940]   and then after he hung himself, he fell to the ground,
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.940]   and his entrails gushed out."
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.940]   That's the last statement of him.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.940]   It doesn't tell us that he felt bad, and went, and wept, and repented,
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.940]   and Jesus restored him.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.940]   The very last statement of Judas is,
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.940]   "He hung himself, and his intestines just gushed out."
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.940]   The end. And we never hear from him again.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:24.940]   So the natural question is, what caused him to betray Christ?
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.940]   Why did he do this? Why was he chosen?
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.940]   Why was he among them? Why did Jesus tolerate this?
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.940]   I mean, I think the reason why this is so important to us,
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.940]   because I don't know about you, but when I read this,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.940]   the reason why it disturbed me, is how am I going to know for sure?
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:42.940]   How do I know?
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:49.940]   If somebody that was hand-picked by Christ, how would I know that this isn't me?
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.940]   Some of the things that I'm going to say, I'm already giving you a heads-up.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.940]   So far, we've been talking about the 12 disciples,
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.940]   and for the most part, they were regular men.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.940]   In fact, many of them are sinners.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   They made huge mistakes.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.940]   These are not people you can say, "Oh, these are the reasons why they picked him."
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.940]   In fact, exactly the opposite.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.940]   Their weaknesses, God touches them, Jesus touches them,
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.940]   and then uses them in a mighty way.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.940]   And so it's very encouraging that God can use somebody like Matthew,
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.940]   or Simon the Zealot, or regular fishermen,
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.940]   and say, "Oh, if God can use them, God can use us."
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.940]   I'm giving you a heads-up today that this is going to be a heavy message,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.940]   because Judas is given to us as a warning.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.940]   If somebody who was in the position of Judas
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.940]   could end up doing what he did,
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.940]   and to be in judgment for eternity,
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.940]   how can we be sure that that's not us?
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.940]   How can we be sure?
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.940]   Well, there's five things that I want to point out here,
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.940]   and I'm probably not going to get to all of them today,
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.940]   and I want to take some time, instead of just rushing through these points,
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   I think each one of these points are important enough,
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.940]   and I'm going to tell you that at the end of the sermon,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.940]   some of you are going to say, "Man, this guy,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.940]   I'm not sure if I want to come to this church.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:15.940]   It's too heavy. This guy makes us feel bad every time."
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:21.940]   Some of you are going to be disturbed,
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:26.940]   and you're going to be disturbed because the truth, in my opinion,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.940]   is going to disturb you.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.940]   There's five things that I want to point out,
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.940]   why he betrayed Christ.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.940]   Number one, it's clear that he was not a believer.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.940]   He was not a believer.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.940]   I mean, we know that very clearly.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.940]   We see how his life ends.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.940]   He was in the church.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.940]   He was there when Jesus turned the water into wine.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.940]   You know, how many of us think that if Jesus would just reveal himself,
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.940]   if he would speak to me, or if he opened up the heaven and said, "I'm for real,"
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   or if he saw a genuine miracle that happened right in front of us,
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:04.940]   you know, maybe some of us are thinking that, "Then I could really believe.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:09.940]   Maybe my faith would get to the next level if I can experience some of this."
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:15.940]   Judas had front row seats to every miracle that Jesus performed.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.940]   Changing of the water, he saw Jesus calming the storm.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:26.940]   He was right there, and he distributed the bread and the fish
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.940]   for $5,000 and then to $4,000.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.940]   He saw Jesus walking on the water, catching loads of fish.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:39.940]   In fact, right before, a few days before Judas betrays Jesus,
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.940]   he was an eyewitness of the resuscitation or raising of Lazarus.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   He saw somebody that he knew who died, and Jesus raised him from the dead.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.940]   He was an eyewitness of that.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.940]   You would think that that would be enough for him to surrender his life
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.940]   and believe and follow Christ like the rest of the disciples.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:04.940]   But even the raising of Lazarus was not enough.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.940]   Isn't that a scary thought?
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:15.940]   In fact, the question that we have, how can somebody who saw everything that he saw,
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:23.940]   how can somebody who was that close to all of his miracles end up doing what he did?
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.940]   That's hard to believe because you and I would naturally think that if we were part of that,
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:32.940]   I mean, what other option did you have than to believe and surrender and to follow him?
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.940]   But Judas did not.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:41.940]   In fact, in Luke 9, 1-2, when Jesus sends out the disciples, this is what he says,
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.940]   "And he called the twelve together and gave them the power and authority over all the demons
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:51.940]   and to heal diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to perform healing."
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:56.940]   Not only did he witness that, the scripture says that Jesus gave him authority.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   He actually experienced healing himself.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.940]   He healed people. He cast out demons while he was preaching the gospel.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.940]   Not only did he see it, he actually practiced it.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.940]   And yet he denied Christ and did what he did.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.940]   Isn't that a scary thought?
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.940]   And you automatically think, well, if somebody became a pastor and you went to seminary
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:25.940]   and spent all that time to preach the gospel, like clearly he must be a man of God.
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:31.940]   I mean, compared to Judas, I mean, we didn't experience anything.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   How can a man who has experienced all of that have front row seats to the Son of God walking on earth,
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:48.940]   giving all the evidence that he gave, and then to willfully choose to sell him out for 30 pieces of silver?
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.940]   Again, some of you who are new to the faith may look at that and say, "Ah, that just sounds like a fairy tale.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.940]   I don't see that happening."
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:59.940]   Those of you who have been a Christian for a while, you've seen it yourself.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:06.940]   You've seen people who were influential and big names and thousands of people who followed them
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:14.940]   and then find out that behind the scene, like they were nothing that we thought they were.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:22.940]   He was an unbeliever, and it is very clear that despite all that he had experienced, he never believed.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.940]   The Scripture makes it very clear.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.940]   He said he left us because he was never really of us.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.940]   That's what John says in 1 John.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:36.940]   Him leaving proved that he was never really with us, even though every evidence,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:41.940]   at least that they thought that he was one of them, but him leaving, him doing what he did
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.940]   and then dying the way he did proved that he was never really of us.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:56.940]   In Luke 16, 27-31, Jesus gives a parable about this rich man and this poor brother, Lazarus,
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.940]   and how they die and how Lazarus is in Abraham's bosom,
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:05.940]   and this rich man is looking up and regretting how he lived his life.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:11.940]   And so he's begging Abraham, basically, if you would just send somebody
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.940]   so that this wouldn't happen to my brothers.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   In 1 John, 27, he said, "Then I beg you, Father, that you send him to my father's house,
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:25.940]   for I have five brothers, in order that he may warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment."
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.940]   But Abraham said, "They have Moses and the prophets."
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.940]   And Moses and the prophets, he's talking about the Scripture.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.940]   They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.940]   He didn't say let them see them, let them experience them, let them touch them.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.940]   He said, "Let them hear them."
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:47.940]   But he said, "No, Father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent."
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.940]   But he said to him, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.940]   they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead."
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.940]   Even if somebody rises from the dead.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.940]   And that's exactly what happened with Lazarus.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.940]   He was an eyewitness of the resurrection of Lazarus, but that didn't make him a believer.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:08.940]   Just like Jesus said of the parable.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:14.940]   What Christ has ordained, what God has ordained to bring a sinner to Christ is the preaching of the gospel.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:19.940]   That's why he says, "Whether it's season or out of season, preach the word."
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.940]   He says, "Faith comes from hearing, and the hearing of the word of God."
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:32.940]   He says, "The only thing that God has ordained to get a sinner to repent of his sin and come to Christ is the word."
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:38.940]   He said, "Even if somebody comes from the dead, even if you see miracles, even if you perform all these miracles yourself,
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:46.940]   if the word of God has gone out and they have not repented, there's nothing else coming."
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.940]   You have everything that you need to come to Christ in the word of God.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:56.940]   Some of us have a tendency to think that if only God would change this circumstance,
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.940]   only if I had this, only if I experienced it, only if God would answer my prayers,
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.940]   then my faith would be stronger, and then I would give my life to Christ.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.940]   Jesus says, "No." He says, "You have the word."
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:15.940]   You have the word, and if the word of God, by the conviction of the Holy Spirit, is not enough for you to come to Christ,
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   there's nothing else coming.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.940]   There's nothing else coming. There's nothing that you're waiting for that's going to change your circumstance.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:28.940]   And every time you hear the word of God and continue to refuse Him, your heart becomes hardened and hardened and hardened
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.940]   to the point where the word of God is no longer penetrating into you. It has no effect.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.940]   So you come to church, and you can have the greatest revival speaker to come to church,
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:42.940]   but you've already committed that this is who you are.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:51.940]   And so you willfully close your eyes because you do not want the word of God to disturb you.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:53:04.940]   If you meet the resurrected Christ, the first response that you will have in meeting the resurrected Christ is not jubilee.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:10.940]   The first response that you will have meeting the resurrected Christ, He will disturb you.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:16.940]   His presence in your life will expose the hypocrisy.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:23.940]   His presence strong near to us automatically will shed light in darkness that we're holding on to.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.940]   So our first response is not jubilee. It's a "Yes, I thank you."
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:36.940]   Our first response will be, "Woe is me. Woe is me. I'm a man of unclean lips from a people of unclean lips."
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:45.940]   And there's a reason why the first response that God calls everybody to come to Him is to repent, to recognize our sins.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:53.940]   We live in a culture today where assurance of salvation was passed out like Halloween candy.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:54:01.940]   And we think this is a warning that even an apostle of Christ could be this hardened after seeing everything,
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:06.940]   experiencing everything, still walk in His flesh.
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   We have churches filled with people in our generation who are absolutely certain about their assurance of salvation
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:20.940]   because they heard something from somebody at some point in their life that one saved always saved.
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.940]   You can't lose yours. There's nothing you can do to change His love for you.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.940]   They're not walking with God. Their life doesn't look any different than a non-Christian.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:36.940]   Their life has never changed. The trajectory of their life has never changed when they met Christ.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:42.940]   And yet they are absolutely certain that they are saved.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:50.940]   I mean, if Judas wasn't a believer, how can you be so sure?
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:56.940]   If I ended my sermon here, you know, I'd be in trouble, right?
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:04.940]   But I need you to let the Word of God judge you first.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:10.940]   I need you to examine carefully because that's what the Word of God does.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:16.940]   That's what the Word of God does. He did what He did because He was not a believer.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:22.940]   The Word of God was taught. And yet He hardened His heart.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:28.940]   In Hebrews 6, 4-8, it describes exactly what happened to Judas.
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.940]   "For in the case of those who have once been enlightened"
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.940]   and "enlightened" is not referring to somebody who became a genuine believer,
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.940]   somebody who has been taught the Word of God.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:43.940]   So if you ask this individual to explain the Gospel, they will be able to articulate the Gospel to you.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:48.940]   That's what He means by "enlightened." You've been given the truth.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.940]   "For in the case of those who have once been enlightened, they have tasted the heavenly gift."
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:58.940]   And He's not talking about salvation. The heavenly gift He's referring to is the church
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:03.940]   and the gift and the people that were around, the ministry of the Holy Spirit, of worship.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:11.940]   So everything that a genuine Christian would be exposed to, this person has been exposed to, like Judas.
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.940]   Partakers of the Holy Spirit. Not the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, that happens to a Christian.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:22.940]   Partakers, meaning that the Holy Spirit, just like when Judas went out and he was preaching the Gospel
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.940]   and casting out demons, he didn't do that by his own flesh.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:32.940]   The Holy Spirit was using him to do miracles. He's referring to somebody like Judas.
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:39.940]   Partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good Word of God and the powers of the age to come.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:47.940]   In other words, in every other way, he had the same privilege that everybody else had.
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.940]   And then have fallen away.
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:55.940]   It is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucified to themselves the Son of God
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.940]   and put Him to open shame.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.940]   After you've experienced all of that, you're able to articulate the Gospel, you're part of the church,
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:07.940]   you became a member, you're serving, maybe you're even leading in some capacity.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:12.940]   Now, is he saying that then, after you've been privileged to all of this, you heard the Gospel,
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:17.940]   you're able to articulate the Gospel, and then fall in a way that there's no, it's impossible to bring it to repentance.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.940]   Does he mean that if you backslide, that you can never, that He'll never forgive you?
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.940]   No, that's not what he's referring to.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:31.940]   He's saying that you've had every privilege to come to Christ.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:38.940]   The only way that you can have genuine salvation is by forgiveness, by the blood of Christ.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.940]   And you've been taught that.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.940]   You've seen the power that comes with that.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:48.940]   And yet, you chose to chase after the world.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:54.940]   What he's saying is, he's not like backsliding that if you repent, He's not going to, of course He's going to forgive you.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.940]   If there's true repentance.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.940]   He told Peter and the disciples, "How many times should I forgive?"
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.940]   He said, "Seven times seventy."
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.940]   As long as he repents, forgives him, forgive him.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:09.940]   He's talking about if you know the right way, and if you've seen, if you've been privileged in every way,
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:20.940]   and you choose, you choose to live a life like anybody else, as an unbeliever, there's no other way of salvation.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.940]   Church is not going to save you.
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:26.940]   Small groups are not going to save you.
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.940]   Quoting right doctrines is not going to save you.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.940]   Giving is not going to save you.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.940]   Christ said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:35.940]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:42.940]   He says in verse 7, "For the ground that drinks the rain, which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation,
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:47.940]   are useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and its end ending up being burned."
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:05.940]   In other words, he said, "You receive the same blessing, same rain, same cultivation, but one produces fruit, the other one there's none."
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:10.940]   And he says, "As a result of that, there will be condemnation."
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:16.940]   Now, Judas on the external, no one could tell the difference.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:18.940]   And that's the scary thing.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:22.940]   You can look at that and say, "Well, you know, one of you is going to betray me."
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.940]   And it's like, we knew it.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.940]   Judas was acting funny. He was always in the background.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.940]   He was always griping and complaining. He said, "None of that. Nobody knew. They all asked, 'Is it me? Is it me?'
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.940]   Nobody knew."
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.940]   My guess is some of them might have said, "Oh, maybe Matthew. I knew it. That guy.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.940]   Should have never brought that guy on."
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   Simon the Zealot, that guy's always willing to kill people.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.940]   That guy. You know what I mean?
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   He says he's going to give his life. He's like, "Oh, that's it."
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.940]   He's not going to do what he wants, what we want.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.940]   Maybe Andrew, because he was like, "How come I'm not on one of the three?"
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:57.940]   Maybe somebody disgruntled, but there was nothing about Judas.
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.940]   Because Judas did everything that everybody else did.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.940]   None of them were able to distinguish that it was Judas.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:13.940]   The only distinction between the Judas and the other 11 was that his faith wasn't real.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.940]   He went through the motion. He did everything everybody else did.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:24.940]   He received everything that everybody else did, except he did not believe.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   He wasn't a believer.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   And him, the way his life ended, was evidence.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:37.940]   He left us because he was never really of us.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.940]   Isn't that a scary thought?
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.940]   Our assurance of salvation doesn't come from our works.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.940]   Our assurance of salvation doesn't come from our position.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.940]   Our assurance of salvation doesn't come from our fruit.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:56.940]   Because if that was, Judas should have been saved.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.940]   There's only one thing that has been given where you can have assurance of salvation,
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.940]   and that's your faith.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.940]   Your faith.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.940]   And I'm going to get to that at the end.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:15.940]   Second thing, and we'll end up leaving with this.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.940]   He was clearly tempted by money.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.940]   He was an unbeliever, and the only evidence that we have that there was something askew with him
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.940]   was the way he handled money.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.940]   John 3, 18-20, it says, "This is the judgment that the light has come into the world,
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:34.940]   and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil."
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   And then in Romans 1-21, it says, "For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.940]   What does it mean for the heart to be darkened?
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.940]   It means they're closing their eyes.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.940]   They don't want to see.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.940]   Whatever it is that you're showing, they don't want to see.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:59.940]   Have you ever watched a movie or something, or something's coming on, and you don't want to see?
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.940]   Maybe it's the violence, right?
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.940]   Whatever it may be, you really don't. You don't want that image in your head.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.940]   It's disturbing you. Maybe you're not going to be able to go to sleep.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.940]   Maybe when you're a young child, you remember doing that.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.940]   Maybe a scene that is horrifying.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:16.940]   Whatever it is, you close your eyes. "I don't want to see this."
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:21.940]   Well, this is the exact reverse of that.
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.940]   We don't want to see because we don't want that image in our head because we don't want to be bothered.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:34.940]   But the scripture says, when somebody is committed and tempted, like, "I have to have this,"
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.940]   they don't want the light turned on.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.940]   They enjoy what they're experiencing in the darkness.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:47.940]   They like it when it's hazy because once the light gets turned on, you can see all the filth.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.940]   I mean, maybe your room is filthy, and it's better to keep it dim, right?
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   I never understood why you go to a steakhouse and they always keep the light dim.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.940]   So it makes me question, what are they trying to hide?
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.940]   If I'm trying to eat my food, I want the light to be on.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:05.940]   I want to know what I'm eating.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.940]   But there's a reason in other places where you keep the things dim,
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.940]   or you want to turn off the light because you don't want to see clearly what's going on.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:18.940]   Scripture tells us that the light is coming to the world, and because they love the darkness
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:24.940]   and they don't want the light, they deliberately close their eyes to the truth.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.940]   It wasn't that they weren't exposed to the truth.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.940]   It wasn't that they didn't hear.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.940]   They don't want to hear.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.940]   That's why when you see somebody drifting into sin, one of the first things that they do
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.940]   is they begin to ignore the Bible.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:42.940]   All these years that I've been counseling people, I've never seen somebody who is deliberately embracing sin,
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.940]   who is regularly studying the Bible.
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.940]   Because the Bible says that it judges the thoughts and intentions of a heart.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.940]   So you can be at Bible study.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.940]   You can come to church and hear things.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:00.940]   But I've never seen somebody who is deliberately embracing sin, unrepentant,
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.940]   who is actively dividing the Word of God.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.940]   Because the Word of God is exposing light to your sin.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.940]   So that's usually how it starts.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:16.940]   And then what happens is if that isn't enough, you'll end up moving away from other people
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.940]   who are shedding light.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.940]   And then eventually, you end up drifting out and leaving the church as a whole.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:24.940]   And you'll blame the church.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.940]   You'll be like, "Ah, these people didn't do this, didn't do that."
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.940]   But at the core of it, you didn't want to be around the light.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.940]   Because the light makes you feel uncomfortable.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:39.940]   Judas was a man who was tempted.
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:45.940]   And in John 12, 2-6, the only thing outside of him betraying Jesus,
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:50.940]   the only thing that was mentioned about Judas that pointed to the fact that he was an unbeliever,
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:57.940]   it says in John 12, 2-6, Mary breaks an expensive perfume that's worth a whole year's pay.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.940]   And Judas steps in with his fake righteousness.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.940]   And he says, "Oh, what a waste. We could have used that to feed the homeless."
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:08.940]   And then it says, almost as an addendum at the end, it says,
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.940]   "He's not saying this because he really cared for the homeless.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.940]   It's because he was tapping into the money.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:17.940]   He was stealing money from Jesus and the disciples."
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.940]   My guess is none of the disciples, if they knew this,
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.940]   obviously when Jesus said, "One of you is going to betray me," it's like, "Yeah, yeah, that guy.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   He's always taking money from our money bag.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.940]   I didn't want to say anything, but now that you bring it up."
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.940]   They didn't know. None of them knew.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.940]   My guess is after he betrays Jesus and Jesus is resurrected,
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   and they're at that campfire eating fish, they say, "Jesus, where's Judas?
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.940]   What happened to him? I heard he hung himself and he died.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.940]   Is he going to be in heaven?"
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:50.940]   My guess is they probably asked Jesus, and that's when Jesus said he was never a believer.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.940]   And the evidence of that is I already knew what he was doing with the money.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:02.940]   He kind of let it take its toll, let it have its fruit.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:10.940]   In fact, my guess is that Judas followed Christ because he thought there was going to be benefit coming from it,
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.940]   just like a lot of the other disciples did.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:16.940]   But the difference between Judas and the other disciples is even though they were tempted,
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:20.940]   they believed who Jesus was.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:23.940]   And then Jesus made it very clear.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:28.940]   "I'm going to go to the cross. I'm going to die, and I'm going to resurrect."
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:34.940]   And the other disciples are arguing, "Who's the greatest in the midst of this?"
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:40.940]   I look at this and say, "Well, Judas seems like to be the only one who was paying attention."
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:46.940]   Because Jesus kept on saying, "If you want to follow me, you need to deny yourself and pick up the cross."
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:50.940]   My guess is Judas is shrewd. He's like, "What?
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:55.940]   I thought if I followed him, I'm going to get rich. I mean, this is going to be the next king of Israel."
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.940]   And he's saying that he's going to give himself up. He's going to die, be crucified.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.940]   He said, "If you want to find your life, lose it. If you want to--
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.940]   He who seeks his life will lose it. He who loses his life for my sake will find it."
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:17.940]   And if you add up what Jesus is saying, he said, "The end of this road is not going to be beneficial for me."
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:23.940]   So my guess is Judas was calculating, weighing, and then when he actually started going to the cross,
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:30.940]   he's like, "Wait a second. I left everything to follow you too because I thought I was going to become rich and famous."
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.940]   But he's actually going to the cross.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.940]   So my guess is I'm going to have to salvage something from here.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   So he goes there and he sells Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, which was the price of a slave in the Old Testament.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:52.940]   And so he sold him out like a slave.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.940]   And so my guess is Judas was weighing, he's like, "At least I salvaged something."
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.940]   These dummies, they don't seem like they know who's the greatest.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:10.940]   Like, did you hear what he said? He said he's going to die and you're fighting over who's going to be the greatest?
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:21.940]   As strange as that may sound, as strange as that may sound, how much of our hope in Christ,
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:30.940]   how much of what we do at the core of our heart is no different than Judas.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.940]   That if we suffer now, then maybe next year.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.940]   If we sacrifice now, maybe it's coming.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.940]   So it's almost kind of a trade-off.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.940]   I'll forsake everything and follow you if I become rich at the end.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.940]   If you take care of me, my kids are taken care of and everything is good.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.940]   But when that doesn't come, it's like, "Well, why did I follow Christ?"
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.940]   The love of money blinded this man.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:05.940]   Even as he was exposed to everything that he was exposed to, he never got over the fact of his own flesh.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:11.940]   In 1 Timothy 6, verse 10, it says, "For the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil."
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:15.940]   Money is not evil. It's the love of money.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:21.940]   Where you think that having more money is going to solve your problems.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:28.940]   And so you come to Christ, you come to church to meet certain needs.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:31.940]   Make sure that you have insurance that when you die you're going to go to heaven.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.940]   But if you examine your life and your spending habits, what you buy, what you don't buy,
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:40.940]   how much of that reflects the kingdom in eternity?
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:45.940]   He says, "The love of money is the root of all sorts of evil,
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:53.940]   and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:10:01.940]   Judas betrayed Christ because he never really fully understood the value of what he had in Christ.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:09.940]   If you are a non-believer, coming to church is a huge benefit because people love you, care for you,
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:14.940]   you're part of a community, there's a sense of purpose, good morals are taught to your children.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.940]   But you don't understand the value of Christ.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:23.940]   The scripture says, Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a farmer who went out and found treasure,
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.940]   and he realized and recognized the value of this treasure,
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   so he went back and sold everything that he had in order to have this treasure."
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:36.940]   Or you're like another person who goes out and finds a pearl, and you see the value of this pearl,
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:39.940]   and so you sell everything to make sure that you have this pearl.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.940]   And he said that's what the kingdom of heaven is like.
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:51.940]   When you recognize the value of Christ, when you recognize the greatest treasure in your life is Christ,
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.940]   that everything else becomes rubbish in light of this treasure.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.940]   See, Judas never knew this treasure.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   His treasure was still money, his treasure was still fame, his treasure was no different than the rest of the world.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:07.940]   So he was using Christ to get to what he wants.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:15.940]   But when it looked like he wasn't going to get it, let me salvage at least 30 pieces of coin.
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:22.940]   How much of our pursuit, if we're not careful, looks like Judas?
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:29.940]   How much of what we value, like if I do this, if I do that, there's something coming, I'm going to do that,
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:34.940]   even in the context of preaching the gospel.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:40.940]   You know, what's interesting is if you fly, whenever we go to India,
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.940]   we have a choice to go through the Middle East or we can go through Asia,
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:49.940]   because it's almost exactly at the other side of the globe, and there's no plane that goes directly.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:54.940]   So we usually have to stop at Dubai or Doha and catch another plane to get into.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:00.940]   Or if you go the other way, you either stop in Japan or Singapore, and then we have to fly into Bangalore.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.940]   That's usually our flight.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.940]   And so out of the 13, 14 years I've been in and out of India,
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.940]   I've been about half a time through the Middle East and half a time through Asia.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:14.940]   And after a while, I noticed something very distinct about the traveling on both sides.
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:19.940]   Whenever you go through the Middle East, the plane is filled with children.
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.940]   I mean, the plane is packed. You have two adults and you have four kids.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:29.940]   And usually it's pretty loud. The kids are, you know, they're usually a little bit more better behaved.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.940]   But you see a lot of children on that side.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.940]   But whenever you travel through Asia, there's almost no children.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:42.940]   And if you study what's going on, a lot of these Asian countries that have money to be able to travel,
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.940]   a lot of the poor countries that can't travel, they're not on the planes anyway.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.940]   They're all decreasing in population. And China's on the top of that.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:58.940]   They're concerned that if China's depopulation continues to happen by the time 2050,
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:02.940]   they think that their whole country is going to crumble because they don't have enough infrastructure
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.940]   with younger people coming up to hold up the economy.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:11.940]   This is happening in Korea. It's happening in Taiwan. It's happening in Japan.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:16.940]   And if you ask them why they're not having children, the answer is universal.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:20.940]   We don't have the money. We don't have the money.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:25.940]   And the reason why they say that is not because it's so expensive to raise children.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.940]   It's because what they think that they need to have. They need to have the strollers.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.940]   They need to have the phone. They need to have the big car. They need to be able to travel.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.940]   They need to be able to pay for their education.
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:41.940]   And so when you add all that up, what they made a necessity, not a luxury, but a necessity,
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.940]   they can't have children. So what's happening is in China,
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:51.940]   most of the children are being raised by grandparents because the mother and the father
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:55.940]   basically leaves them and they go to far places, sometimes overseas,
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:00.940]   and they see their children during vacations, and the grandparents are raising them.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:05.940]   So what's happening in the next generation is if it's this hard and we can't even see our kids,
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.940]   why even have kids? So the next generation isn't even having kids.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:14.940]   So before, the Chinese government basically said that you can't have more than one child,
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:17.940]   but now that they're concerned, they're starting to have more children,
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:23.940]   but the people aren't having children even though they're able to have children.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.940]   While we were out in Korea, we're talking to--
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:29.940]   initially we thought we were going to have a bunch of college students that we were going to interact with,
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:33.940]   but a lot of them were in their 30s and 40s, and it took me two, three days to realize
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:39.940]   none of them are married and almost no children at all, zero.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   So I asked them, "How come you have no interest in getting married?"
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.940]   And they said, "Oh, we want to get married, but the problem is I don't have money."
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:52.940]   And what they mean by they don't have money is obviously you're able to eat out, you're traveling,
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   you have an iPhone, all of that costs money, meaning like what they think they need to have.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:06.940]   But basically, the population is dying because they somehow convinced themselves that they don't have money.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:12.940]   So we're going to use those resources to enjoy our life instead of pouring into the next generation.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:17.940]   Now you and I don't have that problem, right?
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.940]   That's not where we live.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.940]   Especially in our church, we have many children, right?
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.940]   I think on the average, we have more children than other places that I go to.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:39.940]   But the problem with us is that we have made our children and providing for them our idol.
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:46.940]   Whether we love money, which causes people to abandon their children and go and do whatever they want
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:52.940]   so that they can have a certain lifestyle, or we think that being a Christian, a good Christian means
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:16:06.940]   giving my children the best that they can have, and as a result of that, we end up forsaking the calling that God has given us.
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:17.940]   Whether we love money, which causes people to abandon their children or making idols of our children, it is the same result.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:23.940]   It causes money, and it boxes us in.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:32.940]   Because of the fear of money, because of the lust of money, coveting of money, and usually it's not green, right?
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.940]   Many of you don't even carry green anymore.
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:39.940]   It's what the green could do, what this money could do.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.940]   What you can get, the comfort that you can have, the security that you can have.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.940]   And if you have money, you're afraid to lose it.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:52.940]   And if you don't have money, the decisions that you make will cause you maybe not to have it, your security and comfort.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:59.940]   So as a result of that, what I am able to do for God has been boxed in.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:05.940]   God could not be calling me to do this, because if I do this, then I can't provide for my children.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.940]   My children are not going to have this.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:28.940]   So we've boxed him in, based upon the fear and the lust that we've given ourselves into, that we will function in this box.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:41.940]   God's love and his obedience will only function within this box that I have created, where all my financial needs for me and my children are met.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:45.940]   Tell me that that's not what this passage is warning.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.940]   The love of money is the root of all sorts of evil.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:55.940]   Some, by longing for it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.940]   You can love money and be a faithful member of the church.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:04.940]   You can love money and be serving the church.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.940]   You can love money and be very generous.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:14.940]   You can love money and stand exactly where I am, saying exactly what I say.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   But your heart hasn't surrendered to God.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:28.940]   There's a reason why in the Old Testament, the very first thing that God tells the people to do is offer up their tithes.
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.940]   And the reason why they do that, it was an act of lordship.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.940]   It was to recognize that this is not mine, this is yours.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:41.940]   So it's not at the end, after you've paid all your bills, that at the end of it, if I see how much I have left, right?
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:46.940]   Some of you guys were with me up to that, right up to that point, and then now you're uncomfortable, right?
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:52.940]   There's a reason why he says the first of your tithe, because to first recognize this is not mine, this is yours.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.940]   And I offer it to you to establish your lordship.
[01:18:55.940 --> 01:19:03.940]   And then, whatever you have, not to indulge yourself, not use it accordingly.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:09.940]   Use it accordingly, because God knows. He was guarding our hearts.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:13.940]   Because he knows how deceptive the love of money is.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:19.940]   To guard our hearts, to make sure that Christ is first established in all that we do.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:27.940]   The only thing that we can see about him that was different is his love of money blinded him to all the truth.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.940]   And he never overcame that.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:38.940]   I'm not going to get to the other three points, but I'm going to give you a preview.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:43.940]   The first one was he was not a believer. Second, he was tempted by money.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:47.940]   Third, he was possessed by the devil. We're going to be talking about that next week.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.940]   What was the difference between him and Apostle Peter?
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:54.940]   And what does that mean for a believer or non-believer? We'll talk about that next week.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.940]   It was to prove who Jesus was.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:01.940]   Makes that very clear that it was a fulfilled prophecy about Judas betraying Christ.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:07.940]   And then, fifthly, it shows God's greatest work happens in the darkest of circumstances.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:13.940]   Ultimately, it was to reveal his grace in the midst of allowing him to do what he did.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.940]   We're going to get to that next week.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:19.940]   But this morning, I want to encourage and challenge you.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.940]   Some of you.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.940]   Some of you.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:31.940]   Because it's so easy to follow Christ.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:41.940]   You go to a place like India or there's parts of China or North Korea or the Middle East or, you know, where right at the get-go,
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:48.940]   the society and circumstance, your family, your closest friends are going to force you to examine,
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   "Do you really believe this?" because you know the consequence of following Christ.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:58.940]   That if you believe Christ, you're going to be ousted from your family.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.940]   You're not going to be able to get into the school. You may get fired from your job.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.940]   You may actually get physical harm.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:09.940]   So as a result of that, it forces everyone to examine, "Do I really believe this?"
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:18.940]   In our culture, we passed out the assurance of salvation like it was candy in Halloween.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.940]   Just raise your hand. Just give him a chance.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:25.940]   Just come to church. You were on church. Now you're church.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:30.940]   So we have a generation filled with people who are absolutely certain.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:39.940]   And how dare you possibly question my salvation? Who are you?
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.940]   You come to church, it's like, "Wait, isn't the church a place to be like encouragement?
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:45.940]   Life is hard enough as it is. Now we've got to come and hear this?"
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:50.940]   And you're going to leave the church kind of like with this heaviness and questioning?
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:59.940]   If God is not real, if all Christ is was a good example to teach good morals
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.940]   and to make sure that you're comfortable and encouraged so that you can have an easier life,
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:07.940]   then what I'm doing is very sinful.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.940]   Your life is hard enough as it is, and I'm making it harder by saying these things.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:18.940]   But if Jesus was resurrected from the dead, and Christ says what he said was true,
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.940]   that he's going to separate the goat and the sheep,
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:27.940]   that there is judgment for those whose sins have not been covered by the blood of Christ,
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:35.940]   then the most important thing that happens at church is that you meet the true Christ.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:37.940]   That you meet the true Christ.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:41.940]   That you may live the rest of your life in discomfort.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.940]   You may live the rest of your life forsaken.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:48.940]   You may live the rest of your life not being able to provide the best for your children.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:56.940]   But if this is true, then the best thing that can happen to you at church is to meet the true Christ.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.940]   Not the Christ of the culture, not the Christ that you've created for yourself,
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.940]   but the true Christ of the Bible.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.940]   And let me conclude with this to make sure that there's no misunderstanding.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.940]   Assurance of salvation does not come from your works.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.940]   It does not come from your fruit. It doesn't come from your title.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.940]   It doesn't come from what you do.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:18.940]   It comes from faith and faith alone.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.940]   Faith and faith alone.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.940]   But some will take that and say, "Well, it's by faith, then why are you preaching?
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:27.940]   Why are you causing us to be fearful?"
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:33.940]   If it is by faith and faith alone, if everything, if eternity hinges upon this faith,
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.940]   don't you want to make sure that this faith is genuine?
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:42.940]   If everything, if all of these things ultimately doesn't give you assurance,
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.940]   what gives you assurance is faith?
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.940]   We're saved by faith and faith alone.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:51.940]   Shouldn't you examine yourself to see if this faith is true?
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.940]   What is the evidence of this faith being true?
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   You know, when we were hanging these speakers,
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:03.940]   there's like four bolts that are holding these speakers together, right?
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:08.940]   There are some things that we can do, paint the ground or put the stage up,
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:12.940]   but there's a lot of things that we do, like if it kind of, you know, doesn't work,
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:17.940]   the paint will chip off or, you know, maybe it'll be slippery,
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.940]   but there isn't like dire consequence, right?
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.940]   I mean, the city of Irvine wanted to make sure that this is,
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.940]   like whatever we were hanging up there is like solid.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   And so engineers had to draw this in, the bolts,
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   how thick the bolt needs to be, what kind of bolt needs it to be,
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.940]   and how it needs to be held up, where it's going to be.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.940]   And so our AV team, you know, they look at all the plans,
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:46.940]   engineers have to draw this out, and they have to go up there and drill holes and put it in.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.940]   And I knew I was going to stand underneath it.
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.940]   So if this doesn't hold up, I'm in trouble, right?
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:56.940]   But I guarantee you, right,
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.940]   I can't guarantee you that the seats that you're sitting on is going to hold, right?
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:04.940]   I don't know exactly who made it. I don't know the quality of the bolts.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.940]   I don't know the quality of the floor, right?
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:12.940]   It was cheap. We bought it because it was cheap, right?
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.940]   But we checked, double checked, triple checked,
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:19.940]   because we knew that this heavy thing is going to be holding onto these bolts.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.940]   So we had guys that came and made sure that it was drilled a certain way,
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:27.940]   held up, and the bolts are the quality that was galvanized and the thickness of it.
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.940]   And then the city had to come and make sure that we followed every little thing that they asked us to do,
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:40.940]   because the consequence of this falling is either I or you are going to get hurt.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:46.940]   If we ended up using it like, "Oh, you know what? This bolt is a little bit cheaper."
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:49.940]   This actually had to be galvanized.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.940]   It had to be exactly what the engine is.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.940]   I mean, you can hold it. It looks fine, right?
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.940]   And then the earthquake comes in and gets tested, and we realize, like, "Oh, shoot."
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.940]   Right? And this thing falls to the ground.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:07.940]   If everything that you and I profess to believe,
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:13.940]   if our whole eternity hinges upon saving faith,
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:18.940]   shouldn't that be the greatest concern in our life?
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.940]   Shouldn't that be the greatest thing that we need to make sure,
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.940]   instead of just like, "Oh, yeah, of course I believe that."
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.940]   Right?
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:34.940]   If it hinges upon this one thing, to make sure that we genuinely have saving faith,
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.940]   genuinely test yourself,
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:42.940]   to sear of the faith, unless you find out that that's not the case.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.940]   That you've committed to church, you've committed to friends,
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:52.940]   you've committed to the benefits, but you've never met Christ.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.940]   You've never met Christ.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:58.940]   If that's you, if that's you, I don't know what else is going on in your life,
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:03.940]   and I know that there's a lot of heartaches that's been happening recently in our church,
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:08.940]   but the most important thing that you need to answer, and answer it today,
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:12.940]   is do you have that faith?
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:21.940]   If Judas, if Judas, an apostle of Christ, could have done what he had done,
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:25.940]   the only thing that assures us that will not happen is we have faith.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.940]   We have faith.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:32.940]   Let's pray.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:35.940]   Again, as our worship team comes to lead us,
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:44.940]   if I can ask you to take a few minutes to come before the Lord and ask.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.940]   Maybe you just kind of hurried through your faith, you know, you just assume,
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.940]   "I grew up in the church, I heard this all, this isn't anything new to me,"
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.940]   and you just kind of like assumed your faith,
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:57.940]   and as a result of just assuming, your life reflects a very shallow understanding,
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:01.940]   a shallow application.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.940]   But if this is true, if the Word of God is true,
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.940]   if anything that you've heard resonates with you,
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.940]   to come before the Lord in honest confession,
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.940]   "Father, I've been just assuming certain things.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:23.940]   I've embraced a cultural Christianity that doesn't look anything like the Scriptures.
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:31.940]   I've been satisfied with just having good friends and being taught good morals,
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.940]   but I'm not sure if I've ever met you.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.940]   I'm not sure if my sins have truly been forgiven.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:40.940]   I'm not sure if I really have repented."
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:45.940]   All that we are doing at church will not matter if at the end of your life,
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:51.940]   you meet Christ and He says, "I never knew you."
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.940]   Meet the true Christ.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:56.940]   Follow the true Christ.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:59.940]   Worship the true Christ.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.940]   That you may also experience what Jesus has promised.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:08.940]   He said, "I have come to give life, and to give this life abundantly."
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:12.940]   Let's take some time to pray in honest confession before God,
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:22.940]   as our worship team leads us.

[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:54.940]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:57.940]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:00.940]   blameless, with great joy.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.940]   To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.940]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority,
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.940]   before all time and now and forever. Amen.

[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:16.940]   God sent his Son,
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:21.940]   they called him Jesus.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:26.940]   He came to the
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   healing for fear.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.940]   He lived and died
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:41.940]   to buy my pardon.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:46.940]   An empty grave is there to put
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:51.940]   my Savior there,
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:56.940]   because he lived.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:01.940]   I can face tomorrow
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:06.940]   because he lives.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   All fear is gone
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:16.940]   because I know
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.940]   he holds the future.
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:26.940]   And life is worth the living
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:32.940]   just because he lives.

[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:49.300]   I will not fear the darkness
