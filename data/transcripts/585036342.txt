[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   - Good morning again.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.040]   Let's take a moment to go before the Lord and pray,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.360]   asking him to bless our time and the word.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.200]   Let's pray together.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.080]   Heavenly Father, God, we pray that as each Sunday,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.880]   we open up your word.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.440]   God, we know that you are revealing to us your will,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.000]   your truth, and it is our prayer, God,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.040]   that as we open it up, Lord, we would expose
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.520]   the intentions of our mind
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.740]   and the contents of our heart to you.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.780]   God, that we would be changed.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.900]   Lord, that we would be edified by your powerful word.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900]   So we pray for a blessed time this morning.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.260]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.240]   So just by way of asking you to get in a frame of mind,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.260]   I want to ask you to think about the last time
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.380]   that you're about to get into some major trouble, okay?
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.180]   Now, for some of you guys, you're thinking,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.080]   maybe at work, right?
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.460]   You made a royal blunder at your office.
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.220]   There was a time when I used to work at a sales admin
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.520]   at a warehouse distributor,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.320]   and I accidentally sent the end product,
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.400]   the merchant's price tag to them,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.360]   and the upper department managers
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.220]   immediately all sent me one email ticket,
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520]   like a bunch of emails at one time.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.260]   I felt my body just shrinking,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.420]   and then just wanting to escape, okay?
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.480]   Think about a time when you were getting into trouble,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.040]   so to speak, or trying to escape.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.840]   The reason why I want you to think of that
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.640]   is because I want you to think about
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   when was the last time you were tempted to lie, okay?
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   This silly machine, I don't know why it sent the thingy.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.560]   When was the last time you were tempted
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.680]   to fudge on what really happened?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.920]   And the thing about it is, when it comes to maturity,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   even from a young age, we recognize that for little ones,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.680]   for the young children, when we were kids,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.120]   that lying came pretty natural to us, you know?
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.440]   Your mom asks, like, did you eat that candy?
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   No, you know, it's just immediate,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.640]   just without even hesitation.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   And the thing about it is, our maturity doesn't mean
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.880]   that we don't make mistakes over time.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.760]   Actually, our parents are looking at us like,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.840]   do you have the maturity to tell me the truth
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.000]   when you make your mistakes, when you sin, right?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.120]   Unfortunately, truth be told,
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280]   sometimes even though I wish I would mature a lot faster,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.160]   I have still the temptation to lie,
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.480]   and intentionally lie to hide.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.560]   Silliest example, very recently,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.040]   I purchased some camping gear.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.360]   Now, the thing is, I don't go camping a lot a lot.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.120]   Our family goes maybe once or twice a year,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.040]   but I have enough camping gear to last me like months.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.720]   So my wife already knows, like,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.440]   we don't need another thing, okay.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.360]   But to my weakness and flesh,
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.240]   I bought this really amazing solar panel generator, okay?
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.840]   So it's expensive, right?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.560]   And the thing is, as things for guys go,
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.000]   we like to brag about the camp gear we buy.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.240]   So the next time you go camping,
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.720]   they're like, oh, look at that.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.880]   I'm like, yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.840]   And then we talk about the amperage
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.320]   and the solar panel thing.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.160]   But the next question always is, how much did it cost?
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.920]   And immediately I felt this weird tingling sensation.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.400]   They're gonna judge me if I say how much this thing cost.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.160]   And I felt the temptation to hide.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.760]   So I said something silly like, oh, you know,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.920]   just a pretty penny.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.520]   But then the question doesn't stop there,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.400]   how much did it cost?
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.880]   It always goes to, where did you buy it?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.160]   And it's like, oh, don't be silly.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   It's just on Amazon, you know?
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.600]   But then I think, oh gosh, they're gonna know.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.960]   Once they look it up on Amazon,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.760]   they're gonna know how much I paid.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.280]   So there was this weird temptation.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.440]   Now the truth is I had some gift cards.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.600]   It was on sale.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.560]   Rationalizing.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.280]   But I started in my head looking for a number
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.840]   that seemed like reasonable.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.400]   Now I'm giving you the most menial,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.720]   smallest of peripheral temptations.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   But that temptation exists.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.280]   It's like there waiting for us.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   And that's a bit scary because that can be a habit.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   It can be a lie that exists in major decisions.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.080]   And certain things can deeply hurt people.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.920]   And in the end, it could cause us to be very, very far
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.040]   from the holiness of God.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.320]   Now the reason why I think through this
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.440]   is because I've been doing my devotions through Genesis.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.200]   And so today's sermon is gonna be a bit of a walkthrough
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.520]   of passages in Genesis.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   As a heads up, we'll hit lots of different passages.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.120]   And what I wanna do is observe, wow,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.840]   when sin expresses itself,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   it expresses itself in the way that we talk.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.600]   And our Lord Jesus talked about this,
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.320]   saying out of what's contained in your heart,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.160]   the mouth speaks.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.200]   It's not a matter of what goes in.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.440]   And what I realize is as we look at the history of mankind
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.040]   through the book of Genesis,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.480]   yes, we're looking at patriarchs,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.480]   members of the hall of faith, so to speak.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.240]   But when you look at the history of sinful man,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.100]   what we will find commonly is this,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.280]   this pervasive expression of our sin, which is lies.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.360]   And so straight into it, my point is going to be
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.520]   that as I read through these passages,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   I recognized I myself, I'm a man of unclean lips.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.920]   And we come from a people of unclean lips.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.000]   We began by going to Genesis chapter four,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.400]   to at least turn your Bibles there.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.920]   In Genesis chapter four, we have the story of Cain.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.320]   You guys are very familiar with it.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.520]   Essentially, these are the early first human beings,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   first sons.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.400]   And we have animosity between two brothers.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.840]   It says in this passage, Cain told Abel his brother,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.580]   and it came about when they were in the field,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.400]   Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.980]   Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.520]   And he said, "I don't know.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.680]   "Am I my brother's keeper?"
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.860]   Wow.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.360]   Just from the very get-go, what we see is Cain
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.600]   exhibiting this false claim of ignorance.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.560]   And it's wild because he, of all people,
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.800]   being that close to God where God is speaking to him,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.460]   should know in the back of his head, God probably knows.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.200]   And yet just this irrational lie.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.320]   I don't know, but then there's also deflection.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.180]   Is it my responsibility?
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.320]   This is at the heart of the kind of motivation behind sin.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   Have we ever instinctually lied to avoid guilt and blame?
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.840]   Have we ever instinctually just lied to shift?
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   Like, wait a minute, is this my fault?
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.340]   It's his fault.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.200]   Maybe it's your fault.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.680]   It's not my responsibility.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.080]   This is at the knee-jerk reaction of the sinful heart
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.480]   when it comes to these circumstances.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.440]   But the line continues to Abraham, okay?
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.080]   Genesis chapter 12, turn your Bible there
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.700]   and take a look at verse 11.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.800]   In the story of Abraham, what we see
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.060]   is another motivation to deceive.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.800]   And what happens is as God had called Abraham
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   to travel out of his homeland into a promised land
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.340]   that he was going to give,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.920]   they run into scenarios where it's dicey.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.560]   And look how he responds, verse 11.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.080]   It came about when he came near Egypt.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.600]   He said to Sarai, his wife,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.000]   "See now, I know you're a beautiful woman.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.520]   "And when the Egyptians see you,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.840]   "they will say, 'This is his wife,'
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.460]   "and they'll kill me.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.160]   "But they will let you live.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.400]   "Please say that you're my sister
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.140]   "so that it may go well with me because of you
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.320]   "and that I may live on account of you."
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.480]   Now, ladies, what a man, huh?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.960]   (laughs)
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.680]   So what I want you to do is lie.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.280]   Just say, "You're my sister."
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.840]   It's like, say what?
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.920]   Because, because, it's gonna work.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.640]   You're beautiful, they're gonna like you,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   and then me, they're gonna kill.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.020]   Don't worry, it'll all work out.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.240]   You see, what happens here is
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.060]   he is lying to save his hide.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.960]   One of the great motivators of lies,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.920]   when you're afraid, maybe even paranoid
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.560]   of what's gonna happen, it tends to lie.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.680]   Scripture says, actually, those who are paranoid,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.720]   they'll say, "Lions and bears out there."
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.920]   There are no lions and bears out there.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.840]   But you'll say it, 'cause it gives them
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.160]   every excuse for you to guard yourself, right?
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   Exaggerations.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.080]   These predictions, so to speak, cause us to lie,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   and then he's inspiring his wife to lie.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.380]   Now, here's the dangerous thing
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.320]   that sometimes lies lie about.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.760]   What am I saying there is,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.400]   your lies that you actually commit lie to you.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.160]   And you know what that lie is?
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   It's gonna work.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.080]   They say to a gambler,
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.540]   one of the worst things that can happen to you ever
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.040]   is what?
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.720]   First time gambler wins a big hand.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.200]   That's the worst thing that happens to you.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.040]   Why?
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.720]   'Cause now you believe it.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.020]   Next hand, I'm gonna win.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.280]   I double down, you lose all of it.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.080]   It's okay, the next time I'm gonna win.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.280]   Liars are good gamblers.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.480]   'Cause why not what happens?
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.520]   'Cause he lies again.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.680]   Turn your Bible to Genesis chapter 20,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.920]   verses one through seven.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.640]   In Genesis chapter 20, verses one through seven,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.720]   it says, "Abraham journeyed from there
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   "toward the land of Negev,
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.240]   "and settled between Kadesh and Shur.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.360]   "Then he sojourned into Gerar,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.220]   "and Abraham said of Sarah his wife,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.680]   "she's my sister."
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.400]   So there he is in the same exact tactic.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   "So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah."
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.880]   Oh no.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.360]   But then, this is one of the most scariest things
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.540]   that I've ever read in scripture.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.460]   "God came to Abimelech in the dream of the night
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.920]   "and said to him, behold, you are a dead man.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.220]   "And Abimelech wet his pants.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.220]   "Because the woman whom you have taken for she is married."
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.720]   Think about that.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.520]   So Abimelech, he hadn't come near here yet,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.200]   and he said, "Lord, will you slay an entire nation
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.840]   "even though we're blameless?
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.480]   "Did he not say to me, she's my sister?
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.760]   "And she said herself, he's my brother?
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.280]   "In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.200]   "I have done this."
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.560]   Then God sent him in his dream.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.360]   Yes, I know in the integrity of your heart,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.680]   you have done this.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.640]   "And I also kept you from sinning against me.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.440]   "Therefore, I did not let you touch her.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.320]   "Now therefore, restore the man's wife,
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.600]   "for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.180]   "and you will live.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.400]   "But if you do not restore her,
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.360]   "know that you shall surely die,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.160]   "you and all who are yours."
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.280]   Some silly part of superstitious living
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.120]   will read these stories of the Old Testament
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.220]   and be like, "Oh, what a cunning man.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.280]   "It worked.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.040]   "He saved his butt."
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.840]   Not true at all.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.520]   What God was doing is God has a plan
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.280]   for his people to come through this pure line.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.240]   Therefore, he guarded Sarah with his power.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.600]   But this is utter sin.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.760]   And utter sin tends to create incredible drama.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.320]   See, we have this false belief that it's just a small lie,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.360]   maybe a white lie,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.600]   and maybe something really, really unharmful.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.640]   But that in itself is a lie.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.120]   Lies tend to break relationships.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   Lies tend to destroy trust.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.780]   Lies tend to create this kind of drama where,
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.340]   man, lo and behold,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.360]   the entire nation could have been wiped out
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.740]   because of Abraham's lie.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.220]   We don't see that.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.060]   Why?
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.960]   Because we ourselves are deceived when we lie.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.780]   Now, what's more is when we resort to ungodly means,
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.360]   lying is a tool.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.900]   When we resort to ungodly means,
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.660]   it ends up setting a pace for the rest.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.480]   It ends up actually inspiring more ungodliness around us.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.140]   Take a look at the next story in Genesis 26,
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.140]   verses six through nine.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:01.780]   I know right now it's already feeling a little heavy
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.700]   because as we walk through the biblical narratives,
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.900]   you recognize there is just a lot of sin.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:12.020]   And for me, as I walk through it, I recognize there is,
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.320]   because more and more I also recognize
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.060]   there are a variety of ways where, yes,
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.520]   I may not be saying blatant, high, brazen lies,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.400]   but there's a lot of deception.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.160]   Here, what I was trying to make the point of is,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.680]   when we lie, it sets a precedence for the rest.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.960]   And look at Isaac, Abraham's son, Abraham's precious son,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.560]   the one who was so dear.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.720]   In Genesis 26, it says,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.000]   "So Isaac lived in Gerard,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.640]   "the same place that his father was.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.040]   "And when the men of the place asked about his wife,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.720]   "guess what he said?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.940]   "She's my sister.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.180]   "For he was afraid to say my wife,
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.720]   "thinking the men of this place
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.560]   "would kill me on the account of Rebekah."
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.400]   Why?
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.320]   For she was beautiful.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.120]   Now, I relate to these guys, you know?
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.520]   You marry a beautiful woman, your life is hard.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.240]   No, what we recognize actually is,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.160]   these guys are just trying to save their own lives,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160]   trying to preserve.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.040]   Came about when he was there for a long time,
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.440]   a Bimilic king of the Palestinians
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.920]   looked out through a window and saw,
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.380]   and behold, Isaac was caressing his wife, Rebekah,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.160]   and a Bimilic called him and said,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.320]   "Behold, certainly she's your wife.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.000]   "Now then, didn't you say she is my sister?"
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.840]   And Isaac said to him,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.920]   "Because," I said, "I might die on her account."
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   You recognize, you recognize that the same logic,
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.980]   something that may seem pretty rational,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.480]   he's just projecting ahead,
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.960]   is causing this motivation to lie.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.040]   And what we're getting at is, there is a thought process.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.200]   There is not just this like, oh, I just happened to say,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.080]   it just happened to come out of my mouth.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   There is absolutely a thought process
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.140]   behind the lies that come.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.920]   The last individual we're going to see
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.680]   as we walk down these patriarchs
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.400]   and we walk down these significant figures
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.560]   of the Old Testament is Jacob.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.240]   Turn your Bibles over to chapter 27,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.880]   a story that you guys are very familiar with, okay?
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.260]   As you know, Isaac, once he becomes old in his age,
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.420]   he can't really even see.
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.780]   And as he thinks about his passing,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.700]   he calls his oldest son Esau and says,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   "Come, prepare for me a meal from the hunt."
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.780]   He wants to eat a good meal.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.780]   And from that, he wants to give his blessing over.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.380]   Mom hears of it and she devises a plan,
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.820]   tells her son Jacob and says,
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.600]   "I want you to act like your Esau.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.720]   "Come back, feed him his favorite meal.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.460]   "It's going to be delicious 'cause I'll make it for you
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.120]   "and earn that blessing."
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.620]   But think about this story as you hear it.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.700]   Verse 18, so we're in chapter 27, verse 18.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.220]   He said, "Then he came to his father and said,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.460]   "My father, and he said, here I am.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.020]   "Who are you, my son?
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.860]   "And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau."
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.520]   I mean, maybe he did the, "I am Esau, your son, firstborn.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.960]   "I have done as you told me.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.580]   "Get up, please, sit and eat of my game
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.260]   "that you may bless me."
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.140]   Right?
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.460]   You know he wasn't fooling anybody.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.340]   Now Isaac said to his son, "How is this
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.420]   "that you have it so quickly, my son?"
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.900]   And he said, "Because the Lord, your God,
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.980]   "has caused it to happen to me."
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.740]   Take a moment to pause right there.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.440]   When we lie, there's no rhyme or reason.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.460]   And when you have no rhyme or reason,
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.720]   you actually don't really have boundaries.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.620]   You think about the extent of his lie
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.820]   and what he has to say when Isaac starts to question him.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.620]   He is going to use pieces and family members,
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.280]   probably, to uphold his story.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.100]   But here and now, he uses God as a piece
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.860]   in his false narrative.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.720]   Think about God who's watching.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.860]   They're like, "What?
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.380]   "I didn't do that for you."
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.720]   Think about what's happening.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.100]   In order for Jacob to hold up the story,
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.500]   he has to be quite brazen.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.960]   Take a look at verse 21.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.660]   In verse 21, it says, "Then Isaac said to Jacob,
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.800]   "Please come close, that I may feel you, my son,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.180]   "whether you are really my son Esau or not."
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.000]   So I am guessing if you just picture yourself
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.340]   in this scenario and you're Jacob,
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.520]   now you're just like, oh shoot.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.060]   Like you put on the wool and stuff like that,
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.460]   but in the end, I mean, you gotta be scared.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.660]   You gotta be deathly afraid.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.420]   He's gonna know, right?
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.260]   He's inching closer and he already knows his voice
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.800]   wasn't a good sell because he says,
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.180]   "So Jacob came close to Isaac his father
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.340]   "and he felt him and said,
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.000]   "The voice is the voice of Jacob,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.500]   "but the hands are the hands of Esau."
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.960]   He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.720]   like his brother Esau's hand.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.300]   So he blessed him and he said, "Are you really my son?"
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.940]   So even after as he's blessing him,
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.720]   Isaac is suspicious of him.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.020]   And look what happens.
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.500]   And he said, "I am."
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.980]   What I found both in pattern of sin
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.100]   and as I prepared this sermon,
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.100]   I started thinking about various sins that I've committed
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.120]   and moments that I lied.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.380]   And one of the patterns that I saw in my own life
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.020]   and then also in the lives of people at council too
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.460]   is when we're in a lie, you rarely actually give up.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.980]   What you do is you double down.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.260]   And that's what Jacob is doing.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.200]   Isaac is already suspicious.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.340]   Isaac has now asked multiple times.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.060]   He's even asked for proof by touching his hand
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.420]   and he doubles down.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.580]   Can I tell you a funny story?
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.540]   It was a long time ago
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.680]   and so I feel like I could share with you.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.820]   This was when I was really interested in Bia,
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.980]   but the thing about it is I had done that thing
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.180]   where I told my guy friends,
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.020]   like, "You know what I'm gonna do?
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.060]   "I'm gonna do the godly thing
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.500]   "and focus on my spiritual growth.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.940]   "So I'm not interested in anybody."
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.900]   Lies, okay?
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   So as you guys know,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.740]   my good older brother at that time was Elder James Hong.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.100]   He was such a good older brother to me.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.220]   And one time he just kind of grabbed me by the shoulder
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.060]   and was like, "Hey."
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.060]   And back then he called me Moon, my Korean name.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.700]   And he was like, "Hey Moon, are you interested in Bia?"
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.540]   "No."
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.220]   You know, "No."
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.700]   And then I remember him asking me,
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.300]   did you try anything, like talk to her?
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.500]   It's like, "Nah, you know, no."
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.460]   And then he was like, "Oh, let's go for a drive and stuff."
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.900]   'Cause back then when we were stressed with studies
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.300]   or stuff like that, we'd just go for a drive.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.460]   And he went on a drive with me
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.100]   and he was just giving me the opportunity, dude.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.420]   And then he looked over at me and he grabbed my shoulder
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.860]   and he's like, "Dude, she asked me what I thought of you
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.420]   "because she told me you talked to her."
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.420]   I was like, "Oh no."
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.900]   So embarrassed 'cause he asked me multiple times,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.740]   did you talk to her?
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.740]   And I was like, "Nah."
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.340]   So embarrassing.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.020]   I'm gonna be honest, it's so embarrassing.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.580]   And I looked at him and I was like, "Oh my God,
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.260]   "I'm so sorry."
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.220]   But I think back to that and it's like, even in,
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.900]   again, I share with you funny stories,
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.820]   but there is a wicked sinfulness
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.100]   that does not want to give up.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.220]   You double down on your sin, it's like, "I am Esau,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.660]   "feel me, hear my voice."
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.940]   I imagine if we were to just jump in that scenario
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.060]   and watch him, it would be comical, right?
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:21:00.420]   Because he's covered in a facade, literally in sheep's clothe.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.940]   That's wild.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.980]   But it convicts my heart because, do you guys remember,
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.620]   Pastor Peter preached a sermon through chapter 11
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.740]   about the members of the hall of faith, so to speak,
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.660]   and Jacob's in there.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.700]   And I'm sitting here, reading through Genesis,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.460]   thinking, "That guy doesn't belong in there.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.540]   "He's a liar, absolute deceiving liar.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.260]   "So much so, he lies to his own father to his face,
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.940]   "but his father is in his basically death.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.620]   "He's old and passing away.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.900]   "His father is easily manipulated because he's blind.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.380]   "He can't see.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.060]   "And you lied to him."
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.660]   And it was just so, what a juxtaposition
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.060]   of how sinful he is.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.980]   And then it gets worse, you know why?
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.900]   Because not only does he lie to his father,
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.460]   he lies to his brother, whom he has swindled
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.420]   and lied to multiple times,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.300]   even after the reconciliation of the brothers.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.940]   So turn your Bibles over to Genesis chapter 33,
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   and look at the track record of sin in mankind.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:17.300]   What happens is, Jacob, because of the consequence
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.020]   of his sin, he has to run away and escape.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.940]   And as you guys know the story, he comes into a land,
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.460]   works for this individual, Laban,
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.100]   and he wants the daughter for a wife.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.860]   He ends up getting tricked,
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.780]   and then it's kind of like, "Ha ha, just desserts.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.180]   "You trick people, you get tricked, bada boom," right?
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.220]   And then he ends up having two wives, which is, again.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.180]   And then there's all this turmoil going back and forth.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.620]   There's actually a lot of deception back and forth
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.700]   with his father-in-law, Laban,
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.260]   where he has to do some trickery to get all the sheep,
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.620]   and then he's tricking him
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.140]   so that he doesn't get all the sheep,
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.020]   and then finally he leaves.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.180]   Upon leaving, God tells him,
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.140]   "I want you to go back to your homeland,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.660]   "where your family is."
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.540]   So he decides, "I'm gonna obey.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.140]   "God has been with me," and he goes,
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.700]   and on his journey there, bum, bum, bum,
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.540]   one of his servants says,
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.100]   "Your brother is coming for you with 400 men."
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.460]   Jacob's like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.180]   Now, just as a side note, as a consequence of sin and lies,
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.620]   you will always be paranoid.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.940]   It's unavoidable.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.700]   You'll always be paranoid.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.040]   But secondly, what happens is Jacob decides,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.560]   "I'm going to produce this drama
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.580]   "of a presentation of gifts for him,"
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.420]   like lavishing him.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.940]   He creates droves of his family,
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.220]   and what's really sad is you could tell
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.460]   who are his favorites,
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.360]   'cause he knows they're coming for him,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.620]   so he puts the least favorites right up at the top,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.700]   and incrementally, there are massive amounts
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.020]   of gifts given to Esau.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.060]   And finally, when Esau and Jacob meet,
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.260]   Esau actually embraces Jacob and says,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.360]   "I've come to you with favor and grace."
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.540]   There is sweet reconciliation that happens,
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.540]   but then the story doesn't have a happy thingy.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.820]   Take a look.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.460]   Chapter 33, verse 12 through 17.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.460]   Chapter 33, verse 12 through 17.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:10.140]   Then Esau said, "Let us make our journey and go now,
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.860]   "and I will go before you."
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.980]   So Esau's great idea is like,
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.140]   "I don't hold this revenge against you.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.740]   "Let's go down together to our homeland," right?
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.220]   Verse 13, "But he," Jacob said to him,
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.460]   "My Lord knows that the children are frail,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.000]   "and that the flocks and herds,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.480]   "which are nursing, are a care to me.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.840]   "And if they are driven hard one day,
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   "all the flocks will die.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.580]   "Please let my Lord pass on before his servant,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.480]   "and I will proceed at my leisure,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.260]   "according to the pace of the cattle that are before me,
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.960]   "and according to the pace of the children,
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.940]   "until I come to my Lord at Seir."
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.780]   Esau said, "Please let me leave with you
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.980]   "some of the people who are with me."
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.020]   But he said, "What need is there?
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.060]   "Let me find favor in the sight of my Lord."
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.460]   So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.300]   Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built for him a house
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.660]   and made booze for his livestock,
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.300]   therefore the place is named Succoth.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.660]   Okay, I'm not sure if you catch all that,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.420]   but essentially what's happening is Esau's like,
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.760]   "Come with me," and Jacob's like, "No," right?
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.100]   And he has amazing excuses.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.760]   People who tend to lie make really convincing excuses.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.900]   "You know the children and the flock
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.860]   "and then they die."
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.460]   You know, like it's all about,
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.660]   they're gonna die if you do this.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.500]   And what ends up happening is that you go on ahead.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.020]   Esau's like, "I'll leave you my men.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.860]   "They'll protect you."
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.540]   It's like, "No, no, no, no need for that."
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.580]   Esau goes down to Seir,
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.700]   which is about 50 miles south of the Dead Sea.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.200]   So if you, Jerusalem, that area,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.740]   there's Dead Sea, that's like a long strip.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.340]   Seir is like 50 miles south of it.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.640]   What ends up happening is Jacob says,
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.660]   "You go on ahead, I'll join you."
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.980]   And he stops 150 miles short.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.660]   Sikoth is north of the Dead Sea.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.260]   He played the oldest prank ever.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.580]   It's like, "Wait for me there."
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.700]   And then he never intended to go.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.460]   That's crazy.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.020]   Dude, you lied to your father.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.540]   You lied to your brother even after you reconciled.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.220]   And you know what that tells me?
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.580]   As we observe this ongoing list
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.160]   of the various motivations and observations
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.400]   of the sinfulness of lying,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.260]   when you are a liar, you're not trustworthy,
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.000]   but you also don't trust anybody.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.360]   Jacob doesn't trust that Esau is so mature.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.300]   It's like, "You think Esau really is so mature
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.880]   "he doesn't have any ill feelings,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.440]   "no bitterness, is completely over it?"
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.780]   I'm pretty sure Jacob's thinking,
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.240]   "No, no, we'll stay a safe distance over here."
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.720]   Because if you're a suspect, you're suspect of other people.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.180]   This is the world of darkness when we lie.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.640]   Lying causes you to live
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.240]   in the fruit of the kingdom of darkness.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.520]   And you yourself get deceived, you are deceiving,
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.360]   and there is just a constant feeding of deception
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.600]   that goes on into that land.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.480]   And scripture calls out and says this.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.820]   Proverbs 6, verse 12 through 14.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.960]   "A worthless person, a wicked man,
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.560]   "is the one who walks with a perverse mouth,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.220]   "who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.820]   "who points with his fingers,
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.200]   "who with perversity in his heart
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.400]   "continually devises evil and spreads strife."
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.520]   To me, Jacob is a cunning snake.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:34.840]   He's basically exhibited every form of lying you can do,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.880]   and he's even did the subtle stuff,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.900]   where maybe he feigns like,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.080]   "You know, my intention is to go with you,"
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.260]   but he's not actually forthright with your intentions.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.880]   That too is a lie.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.240]   It's a lie when you claim ignorance,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   it's a lie when you exaggerate,
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.680]   it's a lie when you just feign stuff.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.440]   All of that is a lie.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.080]   And the thing about it is Jacob is such a survivor,
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.840]   he's got every tool on his belt.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.280]   But yet, he's in the hall of faith.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.600]   Now, the thing is, as I was thinking about that,
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.440]   I stopped, took a moment, and realized,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.820]   "Oh gosh, am I so different?
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.920]   "Are any single one of us,
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.140]   "when we look back at our pre-converted state,
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.200]   "are we any different?"
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.480]   And then even now in our converted state,
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.680]   being a Christian, do we not have similar motivations?
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.660]   Maybe we can make the excuse
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.040]   that we would never, ever lie directly
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.760]   to the face of my parents.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.080]   I will never, ever use God for my gain in my fake story.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.540]   But if you were to ask me,
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.360]   in my short 38 years of life,
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.940]   have I ever lied to my father?
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.460]   Have I ever lied to my brother?
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.200]   Have I ever lied to important people
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.560]   just because I wanted to escape some guilt,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.760]   looking stupid, or promoting,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.080]   look what a good job I did?
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.920]   And what I realized is, the scripture is true.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.080]   And Isaiah said it very, very well.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.240]   "Woe is me."
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.200]   I may falsely believe Satan will deceive you
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.120]   and tell you your lies are just what everybody does.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.380]   You're just being polite.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.880]   You don't wanna hurt the man like,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.960]   "No, I don't wanna be with you
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.320]   "because what if you change your mind?"
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.200]   You don't wanna hurt him like that, so just lie.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.760]   "I'll see you there, and just don't go."
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.600]   It's a lie.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.320]   What we realize is, "Woe is me, we're ruined.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.100]   "I am a man of unclean lips,
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   "living among a people of unclean lips,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.880]   "for my eyes have seen the King and the Lord of hosts."
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.200]   When we take our eyes off of what is
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.600]   the normal practice and pattern of this earth,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.520]   and we look upon the God of truth
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.020]   whose standard is perfect, we're undone.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.440]   'Cause I'm gonna be honest with you,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.600]   as I was preparing the sermon,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.640]   I started like, again, counting,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.740]   and I feel like the temptation to lie is almost every day.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.520]   It's like regular.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.920]   And I gotta confess that because the motivation
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.480]   in the heart, it's all there.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.760]   The earthly fleshly rationale to do it
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.200]   is all there every day.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.440]   And I wanna challenge you.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.640]   We have to make sure that we turn to the one true God
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.280]   who is the God of truth for the remedy.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.240]   You see, when we think about it,
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.760]   what is the solution for these men?
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.320]   What is the solution for me?
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.960]   Should we sit there and teach them,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.760]   like, do you have any idea what you've done to your family?
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.880]   Do you know the consequences of your sin and lies?
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.240]   You have broken relationships.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.880]   Look at you, Jacob.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.260]   You had such a good relationship with your mom.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.760]   She didn't ever do anything bad to you,
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.200]   and you didn't do anything bad for her,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.480]   but your relationship's broken.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.320]   Why?
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.800]   Because you had to run.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.400]   Your relationship with your brother's broken,
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.080]   your relationship with your father's broken,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.600]   and you go down in history almost equated
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.300]   with deception in the Old Testament.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.500]   Look at the consequences.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.600]   You think that worked?
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.540]   You think that will change?
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.500]   You think that's going to reform a man?
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.140]   Do you think trying to show him,
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.680]   like, that's illogical, dude.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.220]   You're trying to deceive God Almighty?
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.260]   He talks to you verbally.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.800]   He's around everywhere and knows all things.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.940]   He's told you that.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.340]   He sees the beginning and the end,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.940]   and he dictates everything that happens in the middle.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.640]   Why are you trying to lie to him?
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.240]   But you and I both know,
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.360]   at the core heart of deception,
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.900]   it's not logical.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.920]   What we need is the gospel truth
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.700]   of God entering into our lives,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.300]   redeeming us and moving us from the kingdom of darkness
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.560]   into the glorious light of his son.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.180]   Amen?
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.220]   Outside of the transforming power of God
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.960]   moving you kingdoms,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.560]   and then working in your heart through his gospel,
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.160]   this temptation's too big.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.420]   And now you hear of it all the time.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.240]   Recently, stories of people lying, just faking,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.840]   like, I wrote this sermon.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.140]   People lying on high-level powers.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.560]   You hear people lying on every which case.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.600]   But then, for you and me,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.640]   I'm going to move to my second point.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.320]   I know that first point was the longest point ever.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.220]   But the second point is this,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.220]   is the consequences of not turning to the God of truth
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.800]   means you are going to be regularly living
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.960]   in the kingdom of darkness,
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.200]   because without the truth, without the God of truth,
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.500]   all you have is darkness.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.460]   That's all you have.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:57.360]   You have the kingdom of the flesh
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.080]   not only inspiring you to lie,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.640]   you yourself are being lied to.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.600]   Did you know that?
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.960]   Whenever you fall to the deception
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   of thinking that, you know, I'm going to use this lie
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.560]   as a means to mitigate my risk,
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.180]   as a means to escape my circumstances,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.920]   as a means to look even slightly,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.960]   just a little bit better,
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.560]   there is a massive lie that's putting over you.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   You know what that lie is?
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.440]   The lie isn't, oh, you're so good and great,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.280]   or something like that.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.800]   You know what the lie is?
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.160]   The stupid lie is, this is going to work.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.640]   Like, I want you to think about God,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.480]   like being there as the almighty, all-powerful God.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.320]   And this little human thinking,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.640]   you know what I'm going to do?
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.960]   I'm going to dupe you, you know?
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.280]   It's so pathetic.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.640]   But Satan is so good because he is the father of lies,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.120]   ruling the kingdom of darkness.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.420]   He wants you to believe that your feeble attempt
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.960]   and strategy, it's your tactic,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.280]   that somehow it's going to work.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.960]   But we as believers, we're coming to a point
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.300]   for us to surrender.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.280]   God, none of this has worked.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.840]   Look at that.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   Look at the Old Testament.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.820]   It's never worked, and it's never going to work.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.660]   Why?
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.920]   Because what I am seeking is never provided
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.520]   by this kingdom of darkness.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.120]   What am I talking about?
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.840]   I want you to go back and think about why
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.560]   the pattern of sin, of lying that the people had.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.360]   Do you remember that we highlighted
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.800]   that these individuals were lying
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.760]   because they were trying to hide shame?
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.000]   What did you do?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.840]   Nothing.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.640]   These individuals were lying to find protection.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.640]   Oh my gosh, they're after me, just lie.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.880]   These individuals were lying to promote themselves.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.300]   These individuals are lying to escape.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.240]   These individuals are lying to find security.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   These individuals are lying to find provision.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.320]   These individuals are lying to get their way.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.440]   There is motivation behind all these things, you guys.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.920]   And that's what I'm talking about.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.420]   How does the gospel address that stuff?
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:10.280]   The gospel addresses that stuff in every single way.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.880]   And for that, praise the Lord.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:19.200]   God says, I not only take your shame,
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.040]   I expose it to the light.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.440]   I not only expose it to the light,
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.640]   I forgive you your guilt.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.440]   I 100% deal with your guilt by taking that debt
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.680]   of your sin upon the cross of Christ, and it's done.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.160]   It's dealt with.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.000]   I take that security that you're seeking,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.880]   and I want you to know I guard you in my name.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.160]   Listen to Jesus's prayer in John chapter 17.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.240]   Jesus says, I want you to sanctify them in your truth
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.220]   and guard them in your name, in your power, preserve them.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.500]   You want elevation?
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.740]   Do you realize that the gospel we have is,
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   God says, I will glorify you and exalt you in due time.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:05.340]   Every truth that God has given to us
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.660]   eradicates every motivation there is to lie.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:16.140]   Through the gospel, all inspiration for lies dissipates,
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.020]   because we're 100% provided for in the kingdom of light.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.460]   And that's why scripture says,
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.620]   if we are walking according to the light
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:29.620]   and walking in the truth, we can lie down in peace.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.540]   There's no threat, no worry.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.220]   There's no paranoia.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.780]   There's no suspicion, like, are you gonna hurt me?
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.660]   You're not looking around other people,
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.040]   seeing people as threats to your well-being.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.660]   Why?
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.340]   Because you exist in the presence of the God of truth.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.900]   And so my final last exhortation to you is you,
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.340]   we have to, we have to believe and walk in this God,
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.500]   who neither is powerless,
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.740]   neither he has any reason to lie to us.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.880]   He is 100% dependable,
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   that he by his character and nature never, never, ever lies.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.820]   Scripture tells us this.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.780]   So that's point three, God is a God of truth
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.220]   who sanctifies with truth,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.900]   and we have to make sure we're abiding in his presence,
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.140]   operating as his kingdom, according to his truth.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.860]   And say, God, I want all of that.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.340]   I want every single truth you have for me,
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.460]   and I want you to reach down
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.180]   into every single part of my life, and it's all there.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.220]   Why?
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.620]   Because scripture says, in Titus chapter one,
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.060]   which we're gonna be studying in the future,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.860]   Titus chapter one, verses one through three,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.420]   scripture says this, Paul, a bondservant of God
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.860]   and apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.740]   for the faith of those chosen of God,
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.980]   and the knowledge of the truth,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.180]   which is according to godliness,
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.260]   and the hope of eternal life, which God cannot lie,
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.420]   promised long ago, long ages ago,
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.420]   but at the proper time manifested even his word,
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.140]   and the proclamation with which I was entrusted
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.580]   according to the commandment of God, our savior.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.300]   Scripture says, God is not a man that he should lie,
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.540]   nor a son of man that he should repent.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.700]   As he said, and will he not do it?
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.820]   For has he not spoken, and will he not make it good?
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.820]   That's Numbers 23, verse 19.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.020]   Let's take a moment to do a compare and contrast,
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.580]   and just thank the Lord.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.100]   We're talking about essentially,
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.980]   in order to fight the temptation to lie,
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.680]   in order to address this problem
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.340]   that I think every single person struggles with
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.240]   to some degree, we need to see ourselves
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.940]   in these two massive different kingdoms,
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.500]   and here is reigned by the prince of darkness,
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.260]   and here is reigned by the God who never ever lies.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.980]   Here you have one who's duping you,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:57.540]   telling you, you can do it, just do this, it'll work.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.100]   Here's one who's telling you, they're after you.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.600]   Here's one who is telling you, wait a minute,
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.200]   now things are different, you need to do this,
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.900]   you need to do that, and all of that
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.260]   is feeble, vain, and empty.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:13.660]   Here's a God who says, when I say, it is so.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.140]   I'm not your boss at work who says,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.100]   you know, change of thought, I know I had you
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.180]   start this project, we wanted something
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.500]   that was just broad picture, but now I want more detail.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.700]   He doesn't sit there and say,
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.100]   you know, I had a different thought.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.660]   You know what I didn't catch?
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.520]   You have a God who says, I'm so powerful and true,
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.380]   you can bank on me for everything I say,
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.900]   and the scripture says, the sum of his word is truth.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.700]   Do you know what that means for you?
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.980]   Remember how I talked about the motivation?
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   You're secure.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.780]   Your fear is that make you just like,
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.580]   uh, uh, uh, but what if I look silly?
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.980]   What if I look inept?
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.060]   What if I look not capable of doing what you ask?
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.820]   What if I don't look as good as that other guy?
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.860]   Every what if fear.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.820]   Do you understand you have your securities
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.920]   in God who is true?
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.660]   And in his kingdom he reigns perfectly.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.800]   His truth and unchanging, and his mercies and his grace
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.820]   likewise share the same characteristic.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.480]   There's a passage that's really, really beautiful
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.520]   where God is talking about his promises to David.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.020]   Look at what he says, Psalm 89 verse 33, okay?
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.380]   Psalm 89 verse 33.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.600]   But I will not break off my loving kindness from him,
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.700]   nor deal falsely in my faithfulness.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.780]   My covenant I will not violate,
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.580]   nor will I alter the utterance of my lips.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.460]   Once I have spoken by my holiness,
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.700]   I will not lie to David.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.700]   His descendants shall endure forever,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.700]   and his thrones as a son before me.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.740]   Man, that is beautiful, isn't it?
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.980]   This is the God we have.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.820]   And his promise is what we have.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.940]   And if you revert back to that sermon
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.420]   that I referred to Pastor Peter preaching a while ago
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.500]   talking about Jacob, that was not to excuse his sin.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.220]   He's a conniving, cunning individual
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.280]   who lied in heinous ways.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.480]   But what does he have?
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.700]   He has this clinging to the God of truth.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.780]   But your promise.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.740]   But you promised.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.580]   You promised my fathers.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.420]   You promised us.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.960]   And I will seek your blessing then.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.740]   And you know what Jacob does?
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.500]   That's what causes him to move and walk.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.620]   There are people in the Old Testament narrative
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.980]   where because of the lack of fear of God
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.260]   and lack of trust in God, they were unwilling to move.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.920]   But Jacob, every time God said, I want you to move,
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.760]   do you know what he did?
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.340]   He looked at his posse, so to speak, his whole crew,
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.340]   and he said, put away your foreign gods.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.660]   They're moving.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.340]   Why do you think he did that?
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.900]   Because he trusted this unchanging, trustworthy,
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.060]   dependable, consistent God.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.020]   And so my challenge to you is if you struggle
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.940]   with the temptation to hide,
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:22.800]   you recognize that that is at the core of the sin
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.500]   of every single person I presented to you today.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.060]   Essentially, they would just wanna hide themselves.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.260]   But thanks be to God.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.900]   God in his power is dealing with you.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.660]   And do you know what he does?
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.360]   This is one great promise of the gospel and the scriptures.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   God has chosen you to be conformed to the image of his son.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.500]   God has chosen you to be holy and blameless as he is.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   And God has chosen you to be truthful as he is.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.100]   God is going to make you like him.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.380]   And that is a great, great blessing
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.140]   of the gospel promise of God, amen?
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.640]   And so I pray, and I'm gonna read a couple verses here
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.500]   as we start wrapping things up,
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.200]   that we turn not simply away from falsehood
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.560]   as a means to just like, oh gosh, I just can't do this stuff.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.660]   But you're seeing what I'm saying
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.580]   is we need to turn in faith and trust
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.420]   to believe this God who said this.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.780]   Zephaniah chapter three, verse 12 to 13.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.180]   But I will leave among you a humble and lowly people,
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.520]   and they will take refuge in the name of the Lord.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.520]   The remnant of Israel will do no wrong and tell no lies,
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.260]   nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths,
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.140]   for they will feed and lie down
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.000]   with no one to make them tremble.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.940]   As we close off, I wanna ask you this interesting question.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.220]   What makes for a revival?
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.520]   How do you have a revival in your life?
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.540]   Now for me, when I got saved as a senior in high school,
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.520]   our church, I was so thankful for the ministry,
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.920]   but our church, like, they wanted to provide opportunities
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.300]   for people to just come and cry out to God
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.900]   so they had revival nights, right, every Fridays.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.380]   Now for me as a young individual,
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.280]   I approached it the wrong way.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.500]   I approached it with like, okay, I'm just gonna come.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.020]   And I stick out my hands, and you fill me.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.860]   And back then we sang a lot of vineyard songs
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.340]   where it was just like, fill me, fill me, fill me.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.960]   Do it, you know?
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.060]   And you just came like this.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.780]   And sometimes, yeah, honestly speaking,
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.820]   I was just waiting for something to touch me deep.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.820]   And I wished that would produce in me a revival.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.380]   But brothers and sisters, revival is not nebulous,
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.060]   mystic, and strange.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.600]   Revival, according to the Bible,
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.680]   is any time revival happened, God presented himself
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.860]   and revealed, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.360]   I have made a promise to you.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.440]   Your blessing is with me.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.860]   This is who I am.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.300]   And the people, upon looking, just like Isaiah,
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.800]   just like Jacob, when they saw him and heard him,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.960]   what they said was, "What?
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.780]   "Who is me?
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.100]   "Put away all this stuff.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.460]   "Why am I doing this?
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.560]   "You guys, put away all this stuff."
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.100]   Whether it was King Josiah in the past,
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.320]   he read the word and says, "Let's put all those idols away.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.860]   "Put away the false gods."
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.040]   And all they had to do was say,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.200]   "God, I want to trust you,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.000]   "so all this stuff I'm retaining in my life,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.400]   "the idols are for blessings, the lies are for protection.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.160]   "This is for the people that I hold onto as idols
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.400]   "and they are for joy, this is for that.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.480]   "But with you, I can give it all up."
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.600]   Why?
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.560]   Absolutely secure in the God of truth, amen.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.840]   That to us is our revival here,
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.260]   and we could have it any given Sunday.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.600]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:15.660]   Lord God, as we think about the long journey
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.900]   and the long trail of sin,
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.300]   Heavenly Father, you are so good to us,
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.500]   and it's astounding.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.440]   I also think about, Lord, as we pray,
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.600]   your perspective where people have tried to lie to you,
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.420]   maybe making a case that our intentions or heart is good
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.400]   or making excuses here or there.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.500]   Father, today we want to come before you so open,
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.940]   exposed to your glorious light and your truth,
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   to say you are the God of truth who sees all things,
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.520]   and in you there is nothing that can be hidden.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.340]   You are the God of light,
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.660]   and Lord, in you there is nothing but truth.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.960]   I pray, Father God, that we would be so drawn to that.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.420]   Lord, I pray for the congregation now,
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.880]   if there's anybody struggling, so afraid,
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.620]   if anybody is struggling where they've already made a web,
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.220]   I ask God that you would grant to them strength
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.220]   in the power of your truth and your spirit.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.540]   Lord, grant to us to walk with spiritual strength
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.420]   that we might combat and fight against the flesh,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.380]   fight against the lies of this world,
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.820]   and fight against even the own motives of our own heart,
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.740]   and God, help us to walk in faithfulness to you.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.820]   God, we thank you this day.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.020]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.260]   Today, we're gonna be observing the communion,
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.700]   and so as we do so, what an appropriate time to think about
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:46.300]   for us to examine, are there any ways in us
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.900]   where we were not only untruthful, deceptive,
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.020]   but also if there's any residual sin in your life.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.860]   What I'm going to do is read you a passage
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.660]   from 1 Corinthians chapter 11,
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.580]   and give you some time to meditate upon it.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.580]   It says here in 1 Corinthians chapter 11, verse 23,
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.540]   Apostle Paul says, "I receive from the Lord
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.060]   "that which I also deliver to you,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.420]   "that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.100]   "he was betrayed, took bread.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.140]   "And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.320]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.740]   "Do this in remembrance of me.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.060]   "And in the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.620]   "saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.060]   "Do this as often as you drink in remembrance of me."
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.580]   And so we participate in this, remembering the amazing,
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.460]   perfect substitutionary sacrifice,
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.980]   where our Savior was broken, and he shed his blood for us.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.000]   But continuing on in verse 26, it says,
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.480]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.580]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.220]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.120]   "of the Lord in an unworthy manner,
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.780]   "shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.260]   "But a man must examine himself,
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.140]   "and in so doing, he is to eat of the bread
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.300]   "and drink of the cup."
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.180]   And so, take time now.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.020]   What we'll do is, I'll give you just a few moments
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.640]   to reflect upon your current faith
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.540]   and relationship with God.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.380]   And if there's anything you want to repent of,
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.700]   you know that God is a God of mercy.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.580]   Ask him to forgive you.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.100]   And then after I give you several moments to pray,
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.960]   we'll participate in this together.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.780]   I do wanna make mention that if you've joined us here today,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.780]   and you have not believed on Christ as Savior,
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.320]   do not participate in this yet,
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.120]   because this is an act where we proclaim Christ.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.300]   But I do wanna challenge you.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.300]   Our Savior is so good that he can break through any sin.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.420]   And if there's any part of you that desires
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.780]   the forgiveness of God, ask him for it today.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.180]   At this time, if you would,
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.620]   please take about a minute or two to pray,
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.420]   and then I'll gather us to participate in this together.
