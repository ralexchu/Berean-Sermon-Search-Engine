[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   - Hey guys, I'm Chris and I'm going into my fourth year at UCI and this is my testimony.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.520]   Growing up in the church and in a Christian household, I heard the gospel and attended
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.160]   church, Sunday school, and VBS at an early age.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.600]   I would always pray before meals, read and hear stories from the Bible, and discuss church-related
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.160]   topics with friends and family.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.000]   This all became habitual and I never really questioned it because it was what people did
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.520]   around me.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.140]   Others in the church would share the gospel with me at day camps and every year I accepted
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.260]   Christ as my savior without hesitation since I had already heard it and everyone else was
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.480]   doing the same.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.320]   I thought that as long as I was a good person attending church and simply knew that Jesus
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.760]   died on the cross for my sins, that I would call myself a Christian and deem myself a
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.960]   genuine believer.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.560]   Fast forward to middle school and high school, I continued living my life with this mentality
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.080]   and pursued academic success with Christ in the background.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.120]   I began to put all my efforts into school and in my academic accomplishments.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.440]   I had a strong work ethic, which is not inherently wrong, but it allowed me to excel in school
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.560]   and take pride in my success.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.680]   Living in the Bay Area only further motivated my pursuit of man's approval since I was constantly
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.580]   surrounded by successful and wealthy individuals and corporations.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.440]   I still consider myself a genuine believer and I did not go out and party or hang out
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.400]   with the wrong crowd, but I still wasn't different from the rest of the world since I pursued
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.520]   worldly success by constantly chasing the next grade and never being satisfied the next
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.320]   internship opportunity or achievement rather than turning to the word or to prayer.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.440]   In some instances, church became an inconvenience for me and I would skip it if I had too much
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.600]   work to do.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   I did all of this just to beef up my college application and in hopes of going to the best
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.200]   college I could possibly get into so that I could pursue a stable career and live a
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.480]   comfortable life.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.640]   By the time college admissions came around, I did not get into my dream schools and attended
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   UCI feeling ungrateful and filled with pride, thinking that I deserved to be somewhere better
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.640]   and continue to be consumed by school and success while church hopping every once in
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   a while.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.720]   But God quickly humbled me as I struggled academically for the first time in my life.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.560]   No matter how hard I worked, I was failing to meet the expectations I had set for myself.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.540]   This process of struggling made me realize how much hope I had placed into a temporary
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.840]   satisfaction and how far my heart was from God.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.680]   One Sunday while church hopping, I heard a sermon on Matthew 7.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.220]   Matthew 7, 21 to 23 states, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.120]   kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.400]   Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.040]   name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.880]   And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.960]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'"
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   Up until this point, I had only gone to God when I needed him or when I was struggling
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.440]   with selfish things like school.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.240]   My prayers were filled with self-centered desires to get me through difficult situations
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.560]   so that I could continue to pursue what I wanted from the world.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.620]   I had turned God into my therapist and created my own version of him, thinking that I could
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.680]   use him to glorify myself and achieve whatever was on my own agenda.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.240]   This all showed my lack of knowledge in the God that the Bible describes him to be.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.040]   And throughout my time in college, I gradually learned more about the loving and sacrificial
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.240]   God who sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for my sins that were blinding me from
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.200]   the rest of the truth of scripture and his sovereignty.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.080]   Through his perfect justice, I deserved to be condemned, but through his spirit, I now
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.640]   live to serve him and glorify his kingdom rather than my own like I was before.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.080]   I still struggle with sin, but no longer place my hope in perishable things like my success
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   or career, but the resurrection and eternity with him.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   Although my plans did not necessarily pan out the way I wanted it to, I can see God's
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.000]   faithfulness and patience with me.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.160]   He challenged my humility and revealed my brokenness by bringing me to UCI and placed
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.040]   people in my life who have encouraged me and challenged me in my faith as well.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.880]   Though I was undeserving and fell short many times, God was patient and welcomed me into
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   his body.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.000]   And through the gospel, I know that I can trust his hand in everything and place my
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400]   hope in eternity.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.120]   First Peter 1, 24 to 25 says, "All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   of grass.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.240]   The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever."
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   [applause]
