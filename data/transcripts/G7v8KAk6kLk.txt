[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.900]   and obviously fun and games.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   But they are asking you to sign up.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.900]   So if you are planning to bring your children,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   you do not need to be a member of the church,
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.900]   but you can come to that.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.820]   Because of space, what we're asking is
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.820]   if you are planning to bring somebody who is not at church
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   for the purpose of witnessing or introduce the church,
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.820]   please sign them up as well
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.820]   so that they'll know exactly how many people to prepare for.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   And so they're going to be preparing food and snacks
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820]   and candies and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.820]   So they're asking whoever is coming to sign up
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.820]   and if you're going to be bringing friends,
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820]   please sign them up as well.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   Thanksgiving Regional Dinner.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   I know it's in November 19th,
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.820]   but they're asking you to sign up as soon as you can
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.820]   so that they can place you in the proper groups,
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.820]   hopefully near your home.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   So there's going to be a group of maybe about 20, 25 people
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.820]   divided into homes.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.820]   So if you sign up early, we'll be able to put you in that area.
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   Otherwise, we're going to end up having to put you in places
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.820]   where maybe a little bit further away from home.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.820]   So if you're planning to and you are able to,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.820]   And then this coming Wednesday, there is a BAM fellowship.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   If you're in the singles ministry,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820]   there's a bowling night that's happening
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.820]   in the middle of the summer.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.820]   That's a great place to study.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   And then FAM 245.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.820]   If you are a regular member of the FAM 245,
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.820]   there's also a fellowship,
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.820]   bowling fellowship happening on December 2nd as well.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   Okay, I think that's it for the announcement.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820]   I'm going to pray for us.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820]   Again, if you have a physical offering to drop off,
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   we have a box in the back.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   And then afterwards, we'll have Nicholas Chen.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.820]   He's going to come up and give his testimony
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   Let's pray.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.820]   Thank you so much for the privilege that we have
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   to be able to come worship you.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   Help us, Lord God, to lift up our eyes,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.820]   to truly be able to know and to believe
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.820]   where our hope and our help truly comes from.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   Help us to understand who you are,
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.820]   that our worship, our giving,
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820]   may be an overflow of thanksgiving,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.820]   Father God, of the grace that you've given us.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820]   May your offering be given joyfully,
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   cheerfully, Lord God, as an act of worship,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.820]   and be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.820]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   Let us all rise.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   And continuing on from last week,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   let's spend a few moments just to greet
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   our neighbors around us.

[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   My name is Nicholas Chen, and I am a senior at UCI.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   I was born and lived my whole life in Taiwan,
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500]   coming to the States for college.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   Growing up in Taiwan, my father was agnostic,
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   and my mother was a devout Buddhist.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   Since she mostly took care of my siblings and I,
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   we all had a Buddhist upbringing,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   and she would bring me to the temples along with her
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   to pray and burn incense.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   I first learned of Christ from my mother,
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   whose Christian friends had offered to pray for her
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   when my younger brother was suffering from a medical condition
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   that neither conventional medicine nor Buddhist practices
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   could explain or cure.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   After this, my mother converted to Christianity
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.500]   and received Christ, and started bringing my siblings and I to church.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.500]   Seeing both the physical changes God made to cure my brother,
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   but also the spiritual change in my mother,
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   it was really easy for me to accept Christ
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   and think that I needed Christ, that I wanted Christ,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.500]   but not need him,
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   and that I needed a lot of worldly, personal evidence.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.500]   Unprompted, I approached my mother when I was eight
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   and asked to be baptized.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   However, I did not truly understand the gospel,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   nor would it have meant to be saved by Jesus.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   As a result, even though I had had knowledge of Scripture
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   and understanding of the existence of sin
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   and how Jesus saved me from it,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.500]   I lived my life no differently than from when I was a Buddhist,
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.500]   the only difference being that instead of praying to the gods at a temple,
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   I would pray to God at home.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   This was my incomplete understanding.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   Despite knowing that I was a sinner,
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500]   I never felt the weight of my sin,
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   because my standard for sin was just "doing bad."
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500]   I went through middle school and most of high school
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   living no differently than those around me.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   Like most of the boys my age,
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   we satisfied our worldly desires with Internet media,
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   all the while I was maintaining the image of a good Christian boy.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.500]   At the same time, I placed all my self-worth in the things of the world,
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.500]   like my aides, friends, and my parents' approval.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   As a result, when I failed one test in a subject I liked,
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   my entire worldview crumbled.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   Around this time, my parents had also asked me
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   to evangelize to one of my classmates who was seeking.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   And there, God let me feel the weight of my sin
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   when I realized that I had not been following
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   the very obedience that I was describing to my classmate.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   Afterwards, I recognized that I needed to truly surrender my life to Christ
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   and depend on Him,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   and I prayed to God confessing my sins while seeking repentance.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   Unfortunately, due to my own rebelliousness and fear of man,
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   I was afraid to confess this reality to anyone in my life.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   So after my prayer of repentance, I had no idea what to do from there.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   I can't say for certain when the Lord saved me from this situation.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   I think that in the years since that time,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.500]   the Spirit has been working in me to sanctify me,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   as it is written in 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 13.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.500]   My desire to be in the Word and prayer continued to grow,
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   and abandoning my pursuit of the things of this world began to feel easier
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   and less like I was giving something precious up.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   I'm thankful that God had brought me to Berean,
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.500]   where in the college ministry, my brothers and sisters around me
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   greatly encouraged me to continue to grow in my desire for Christ,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   and the Bible study had introduced me to inductive reading,
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   giving me a whole new way of approaching the Word.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.500]   As of right now, I'm confident in calling myself a believer,
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   knowing Christ as Lord, and being eager in my submission to Him,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   and being eager to take my next step in my submission to Him.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.500]   Thank you.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:55.500]   [applause]
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   [silence]
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   >> Do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   you're being united with Christ's death,
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.500]   and when you come out, you're being united to His resurrected life?
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   >> Thank you.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   >> I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   [water pouring]
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   [applause]
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   >> All right, thank you, Nicholas, for that great testimony.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:54.500]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 6, verses 27 through 30 this morning.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:06.500]   Luke chapter 6, 27 through 30.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   "But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you,
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.500]   whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also,
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   do not demand it back."
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   Let's pray.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.500]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   We pray, Father God, that we would not be just hearers of the Word,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.500]   but that we would hear your Word, Lord God, eager to apply.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:52.500]   Help us to understand not just your mind, your Word, but your very heart.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   If you've been following the news this week,
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:05.500]   obviously the news was filled with what's going on in the Middle East.
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.500]   And no matter what denomination, no matter what your background,
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   there's a universal agreement that if there is going to be a World War III,
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.500]   that it would probably be kindled in that area.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:22.500]   And so that's a very sensitive area that could possibly trigger the greater event.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.500]   So we don't know exactly how this will end,
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.500]   but obviously we are praying that the Lord would be upon this,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   and the Christians would respond accordingly,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   that we do not get caught up like the rest of the world
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   in thinking that as long as we're not shooting at each other,
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   as long as everybody is wealthy and live a long life,
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.500]   that somehow we have found peace.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   Our ultimate goal is to bring Christ to the world,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   and we pray that this situation will ultimately lead to greater spreading of the Gospel.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.500]   One thing that is clear, though, that obviously we've seen the atrocities
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   that Hamas, the terrorist group, enacted, which triggered all of this.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.500]   And I want to read to you one of their charter statements
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.500]   that was initially developed in 1988, Article No. 13.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.500]   And in their purpose statement, this is what Hamas says,
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   "There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through jihad."
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   You guys know what jihad is. Jihad is a terrorist act, basically committing suicide.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:37.500]   "Initiative, proposals, and international conference are all waste of time and vain endeavors."
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   And if you read the charter, their purpose statement basically is
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   "Until Israel is wiped out, there will never be any peace."
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.500]   And in that context, when you say, "You know what? We just gathered together.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   Maybe we just kind of learned to accept our differences and get along,"
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   again, it's a very naive statement, knowing that one side of the group,
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   the only way that they're going to find peace is if the other side is dead or wiped out.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   And so that's why this situation is so crucial, because of what's going on,
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   and there are neighbors surrounding Israel that desire the same thing.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   Now, the reason why I'm introducing to you, obviously because of what's going on in the news,
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   but it's to help us to understand the situation that the Jews were in when Christ walked this earth,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   that the Jews saw the Romans in a similar way.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   And there are different groups of Jewish communities, different sects of groups,
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500]   but one thing was universal.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   If you asked a regular Jew of the first century, "Who is your enemy?"
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   the answer would have been universal.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   It's the Romans. They are the ones who are suppressing us.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   They are the ones who are bothering us from religious freedom.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.500]   They are the ones who are taking our money. They are the ones who are suppressing us.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   And so the method in which they were going to overthrow their enemies was different,
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   but the goal was the same.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:04.500]   You had the Sadducees, who were the liberals, and they basically have given up on supernatural stuff,
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   and their idea of conquering their enemies is to join them.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   You can't beat them, join them. Become one of them. Make money. Become powerful.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:17.500]   And so they were the leaders of Israel of that time, and they were the Sadducees.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   And you had the Pharisees. They were the religious group. They were the scribes.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   And they were the ones who thought that if they obeyed the law,
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   that God's blessing would be upon them, and if God's blessing would be upon them,
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   that their Messiah is going to come and conquer the Romans, their enemies.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.500]   The goal was the same, except the method was different.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   The Pharisees believed that if they kept, especially the Sabbath law, perfectly,
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   that God would bless them, and what happened with Assyria and Babylon and the Persians
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   wouldn't happen, but their Messiah is going to come, and they're going to conquer their enemies.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   Then obviously we have the Zealots. They were the militant group.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   They were the ones who carried the knife, and they were willing to die.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   Even though the Pharisees and Sadducees and other groups may not have agreed with our method,
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   they were all praised, because they were willing to give their life and their family
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   and their children's life and their future in order to conquer their enemies, which was the Romans.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   So we would typically think that these are the guys who wanted the Romans killed,
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   and they were the enemy, so you have to understand the mindset of a Jew that Jesus is speaking to.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   The fourth group, called the Essenes, we naturally think that they were the peaceful ones.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   They didn't engage in battle. "I see no evil, hear no evil, do no evil,"
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   so they went out into the wilderness and lived in caves, and they lived in peace.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   That's what we typically think, but this statement, when Jesus says in Matthew 5, verse 43,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'"
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.500]   Now, "You shall love your neighbor" comes from the Old Testament.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   Leviticus 19, verse 18 and other passages teach us that.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   "You shall love your neighbor." But that second part, "You shall hate your enemy," where does that come from?
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   Well, that statement is a direct statement from the Qumran community, the Essenes.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   Even though they were living in the caves, they adapted a part of the Old Testament saying that
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:23.500]   we are to love our neighbors, but the practice of loving our neighbors is restricted to just our neighbors,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.500]   that our desire is, at some point, that we're going to conquer enemies, so we're going to hate them.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   When Jesus says, "You have heard it said that this was said," he was quoting the charter doctrine of the Qumran community.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.500]   You have to understand the kind of hatred that they had toward Rome.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.500]   So when Jesus says to love your enemies, to good to those who hate you,
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   the immediate application that you and I think of is our neighbors, family, friends, coworkers,
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   maybe our boss or somebody who's slandered you, an average Jew would have thought of the Romans,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   the soldiers, Caesar himself.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   Every time they went to the temple, they were reminded that they had a pagan nation governing them.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   Every time they came to collect taxes, they were reminded that their enemy was in charge.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:16.500]   So even though they had different ways of conquering Rome, their goal was the same.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   We need to get rid of these enemies one way or the other by religious zeal, by joining them possibly
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   and gaining more power somehow, by getting into some kind of battle,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   or just hoping that the Messiah will come and conquer them.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:40.500]   So you can see why, when Jesus gives himself up to be crucified on the cross,
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.500]   why they were universally disappointed with him.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:49.500]   Because Jesus, to them, was the person who was going to satisfy their anger.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.500]   They were the ones who were going to finally, they'd been waiting for the Messiah to come
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   to satisfy the desire for vengeance against their enemies.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   And instead of doing that, he gave himself up.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   Not only did he give himself up, he taught his disciples to love them, to pray for them, to do good to them.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:15.500]   In Philippians 3.20, we are reminded that we're no longer citizens of this earth.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   That the citizenship of heaven has a completely different standard.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.500]   And you cannot be a citizen of this world and be citizen of the kingdom at the same time
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   because they're in complete opposition.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.500]   You cannot be a citizen of the United States and you can't be a citizen of North Korea at the same time
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   because they are enemies.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   You can't even get a visa to get into North Korea.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   The only way to get into North Korea is to get in and the U.S. embassy would never know
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   because there's no relationship with them.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   In the same way, the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan has no place where they can coexist together.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   Either you are serving God or you are serving Satan.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   That's what the scripture tells us.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:05.500]   So can you imagine when Jesus says, in that context, "Love your enemies.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.500]   Do good to those who hate you.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.500]   Bless those who curse you.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.500]   Pray for those who mistreat you."
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.500]   If I said right now, like, it sounds good on the pulpit.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   You know, when we describe the love of Christ and how he loved us while we were enemies, it sounds great.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.500]   If I asked you to think of somebody that's wronged you, maybe right now, right?
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.500]   My guess is you don't have to think long.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   You already have somebody on your head.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   As soon as you read this, like, this person? Really? Right?
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:47.500]   Maybe some of you just got in a big fight with your wife or your husband or your children or your co-worker or your boss has mistreated you or somebody has slandered you.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   Love your enemies.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.500]   Is this even possible?
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:41:02.500]   Can you imagine how they must have been stirred up of all the things that Jesus has said to love your enemies?
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.500]   To do good to them.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   Most likely, if you've ever been slandered or somebody tried to hurt you, that your wrestling was not how to love them.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.500]   Your wrestling was not how to do good to them.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.500]   Your wrestling was not to hurt them.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   Right?
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   Not to take vengeance.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   If you show any restraint, that's about the level of restraint.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.500]   That's about the level of love that we can practice.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   Most people won't even do that.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.500]   If you slap me, I slap you back harder.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   Make sure that you never mess with me again.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   So you have to place yourself in the position of these Jews when Jesus says, "Love your enemies."
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   We looked at last week, "Love your enemies," "Do good to those who hate you."
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.500]   And then it says, "To bless those who curse you."
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.500]   Bless those who curse you.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   The word for "bless" in Greek is "eulogia," where we get the word "eulogy."
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   And typically, when we think of eulogy, eulogy is someone who stands up and praises and gives thanks to the person who has passed.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.500]   That's where we get the word "to bless."
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   To give praise and thanks.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.500]   When was the last time that somebody cursed you?
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.500]   Slandered you?
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   And wanted to hurt you by their words, and you responded in return, "God bless you."
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   It's beyond our paradigm.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   There's nothing that you've been taught since you were a child.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   Most likely even your parents.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   You've never been taught that those who try to hurt you do good to them.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.500]   You would only see this in scripture. You would only hear this at church.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   And it's a very strange thing to even try to practice, because it's so strange.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   "Bless those who curse you."
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   Romans 12, 14 says, "Bless those who persecute you."
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   "Bless and do not curse." Don't retaliate in cursing.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.500]   The word for "persecute" basically means to follow, to pursue somebody.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   It's a description of somebody who is actively out to get you.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500]   This is not just somebody who's annoyed with you.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.500]   This is not just somebody who happens to not be good to you.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.500]   The word "persecute" basically means somebody who is actively following to make sure that you are hurt.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:28.500]   These are people who celebrate when bad things happen.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   He says, instead of cursing them, he said, "Bless them."
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:42.500]   Again, sounds great up on the pulpit, but you go off the pulpit, and after the service is over, try to practice that.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.500]   You know how difficult that is.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.500]   Ephesians 4, 26-27, it says, "Be angry and do not sin."
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   "Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity."
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.500]   I remember early on in marriage, I had this passage memorized.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   Do not let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:11.500]   Every time I got in a discussion or fight with my wife, and my wife, when she gets angry, she's usually not verbal,
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:16.500]   but then when she gets angry, she gets even less verbal.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   The first thing that she does is she disappears, and she goes to sleep.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   I'm exactly the opposite.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.500]   If I get upset, I'm activated.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   I need to duke this out.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:33.500]   I remember this one particular night, we got into something, and she was upset, and she just stopped talking.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.500]   That would drive me crazy.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.500]   I said, "Okay, I'm going to control myself."
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.500]   Then she just went inside.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.500]   I'm waiting outside.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   I literally sat on the sofa from 10 to 3 a.m., hoping I'm going to outlast her this time.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.500]   I'm the one always pursuing her.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.500]   I'm going to wait until she can't take it, and she's going to come back out, but it never happened.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500]   It was 3 in the morning.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   I said, "Oh, my God. She's not going to come out."
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   I went in with this verse, "Don't let the sun go down on your anger," and I woke her up.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   [laughter]
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.500]   I said, "We need to figure this out now."
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   Obviously, it didn't work.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.500]   She got more tired and then went to sleep.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:23.500]   I got more frustrated, and clearly this isn't going to work.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:32.500]   Through trial and error, I realized that what this is saying, like literally try to apply it, and again, it would cause more frustration.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   But I realized what it was saying was if you harbor bitterness and anger in your heart and you let it linger, you give an opportunity for the devil.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   You give an opportunity for the devil to allow that bitterness and hatred to grow, and it bears fruit.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.500]   Where it bears fruit is with our mouth.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   Matthew 12:34 says, "You brood of vipers, how can you being evil speak what is good?
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart."
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:10.500]   When you give in to bitterness and anger and you are allowing it to bear fruit, eventually where it will show is through your mouth, what you say,
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   through slander, through lies, through deception.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:20.500]   Because the first avenue of attack is through our mouth.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.500]   And then, every once in a while, you see somebody just lose it and get physical.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.500]   It's like, "Where did that come from?"
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   And if you trace back where it happened, where somebody was wrong, you've allowed the bitterness and anger to percolate in your heart,
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:37.500]   you feel justified in being angry, and then once that bears fruit, it comes out of your mouth,
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   and after it begins to come out of your mouth, it destroys you and it destroys everybody around you.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   Your family is hurt, your relationship with your children, even churches, leadership.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   It's split because of the words, and the words come from allowing the devil an opportunity.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   You allowed it to bear fruit in your heart.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   In Ephesians 4:29 it says, "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth,
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   but only such a word as good for edification according to the need of the moment,
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   so that it will give grace to those who hear."
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.500]   Unwholesome.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.500]   When we think of unwholesome, we immediately think of cursing.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:24.500]   Unwholesome basically means anything that is slanderous, gossiping, lying, anything that tears the other person,
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.500]   anything that's destructive.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   And that comes out because it is an avenue in which we give an avenue to express what's happening in our heart.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   And we've allowed that to happen.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:47.500]   In fact, in the book of James, if you've ever studied the epistle of James,
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:53.500]   you know that the primary problem with the book of James is that there was this division between the rich and the poor.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:59.500]   So the poor people envied the rich, and they were shown favoritism at church.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   And so Paul rebukes them saying, "Do you not know that these rich people, they're the ones who are dragging you into court,
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   they're the ones who are mistreating you, why are you showing favoritism to them? Why are you coveting them?"
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:18.500]   And then he rebukes the rich, saying, "Do you not know, do you not know the low position in the kingdom of God
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.500]   that because of your pride..."
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:30.500]   And he tells them to humble themselves, but the avenue in which this division happened was with their tongue.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:36.500]   Because of the envy, because of the pride of the rich, and because of this division in the church,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.500]   they weren't able to tame their tongue.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.500]   And it was causing all kinds of division.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:49.500]   And so in James 3, 5-10, it says, "So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire."
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.500]   In other words, consider the destructiveness of our tongue.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:02.500]   And the tongue is a fire, a very world of iniquity.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:08.500]   This small piece of our flesh, it has the power to destroy.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:14.500]   "The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body," this tiny little thing,
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.500]   "and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell."
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:26.500]   The words that come out of our mouth, the bitterness and hatred and division that we've allowed to percolate in our hearts,
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:33.500]   it directs the path of our life, and ultimately it is from hell itself.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   "For every species of embers and reptiles and creatures of the sea is tamed and has been tamed by the human race."
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   But no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:51.500]   "With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who have been made in the likeness of God.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:57.500]   From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way."
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:02.500]   I remember years ago, I had somebody ask me just a random question.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:08.500]   Of all the senses that you have, all the things that you're able to do,
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:13.500]   what is one thing that you would get rid of?
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   And I thought about, is it your hearing? Is it your sight? Ability to walk? What is it?
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   And I thought about it a little bit, and I said, "It's probably my tongue."
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   And he was surprised, and he said, "Tongue? You preach for a living.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   If you get rid of your ability to speak, you can't be a pastor anymore."
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   So I could be a pastor. I can write. I can write.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.500]   And so I can still communicate. But the reason why I said tongue,
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:49.500]   because if you've ever tried to conquer your tongue, you know how difficult it is.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.500]   With the same tongue, we bless God, and we praise God, we preach the gospel,
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.500]   but the same tongue, we curse, we hurt people.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:02.500]   Because we allow what we have in our hearts.
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   And I could tell you that I have, as much as I preach the gospel for a living,
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:14.500]   that as I've attempted for years and years and years, I've got to watch my mouth.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   I've got to watch my mouth. And I'm a joker, so I like to joke around.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   And that's not going to stop. But I need to be careful.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:33.500]   And it's not the joking that I am concerned about, because there's no evil intent in that.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:40.500]   But if you've ever tried to not to talk when you're bitter and angry,
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:46.500]   when somebody has slandered you, and not to slander back, you know how difficult that is.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:51.500]   It kills the very being of who you are.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:52:01.500]   And Jesus tells us, when they curse you, to bless them.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:05.500]   Man, that is impossible.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:10.500]   1 Peter 3, 8-10, it says, "To sum up all of your harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly kindness,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.500]   and humble in spirit, not returning evil for evil, or insult for insult,
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   but giving a blessing instead, for you are called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing."
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   You know, when you think about Christian maturity, we think about reading the Bible, memorizing Scripture,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:27.500]   doing an inductive Bible study, being generous and giving.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:33.500]   But then it says, "You've been called to this purpose, to be a blessing to others."
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:38.500]   "You've been called to this purpose, for the one who desires life, to love and see good days,
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:43.500]   might keep his tongue from evil, and his lip from speaking deceit."
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.500]   He goes on to say, "To love, to practice this new kingdom love,
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.500]   praying for those who mistreat you."
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   Praying for those who mistreat you, I mean, praying for yourself is hard enough.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:04.500]   Praying for people that you love is difficult enough, but praying for people that mistreat you?
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:14.500]   It requires a surrender of everything in you, to be able to pray and ask for blessing upon people who want to harm you.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:20.500]   I remember when I was a kid, you know, we would take medicine, but in Korea, for whatever the reason,
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:24.500]   everything that, all the medicine was crushed into powder.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.500]   I hated that bitter taste.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:32.500]   And so, in order for my mom to make me take the medicine, she would always give me sugar water.
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.500]   This is out in Korea.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.500]   So she would promise me that if you take this, I'll give you sugar water.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.500]   And then I still couldn't drink it, so she would put it in the sugar water.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:47.500]   So every time I drank this, it was made sure that the sugar water was drunk with it,
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.500]   because I had such a hard time.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:56.500]   Praying for people that are mistreating you is like drinking bitter water.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.500]   It's bitter.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.500]   It's difficult.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.500]   And you strain.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   Yet, once you become, get in the habit of praying for them, you see the fruit that comes from that.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:15.500]   And the greatest fruit that you'll see are people that you've had problems with at one point,
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:19.500]   turning and loving Christ and loving you and you loving them.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   And it's the avenue in which he calls us to reconcile, to pray for them.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:28.500]   Apostle Paul writes a very difficult letter in 1 Corinthians,
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.500]   because they were engaging in all kinds of divisions and immorality,
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   and it was causing all kinds of chaos in worship.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:40.500]   And because of his harsh letter, they were beginning to question his apostleship.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.500]   That guy may not be an apostle.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:48.500]   Who's this guy, this latecomer, rebuking Peter and Barnabas in public?
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.500]   Who is this guy?
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:54.500]   And they were trying to discount him, discredit him, because they didn't like what he had to say.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:00.500]   So the whole 2 Corinthians is a letter written to defend his apostleship.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.500]   Can you imagine how difficult this letter must have been?
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:08.500]   It would have been easy for him to just kind of like, "Okay, I'm done with you.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.500]   I got so many other villages to visit.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.500]   I got the church of Ephesus. They love me.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.500]   I got all these other people who are supporting me. Forget you."
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:22.500]   Instead, he's wrestling, and he's writing this letter.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:28.500]   And in this letter, he says 2 Corinthians 5, 14-15, "For the love of Christ controls us,
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:32.500]   having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died, and he died for all,
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   so that they who lived might no longer live for themselves,
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   but for him who died and rose again on their behalf."
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   In his flesh, I'm sure he's a human being like everybody else.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:47.500]   He would have easily just shake the dust and move on, right?
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.500]   But the reason why he's wrestling with them, the reason why he's pleading with them,
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:55.500]   he says, "Because the love of Christ compels him."
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.500]   Unless the love of Christ compels you, this sounds good in paper,
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.500]   but you're not going to practice this. Are you kidding?
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:08.500]   Unless you are controlled by the love of Christ, this is a curse upon you.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.500]   This is not a blessing upon you.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:16.500]   It's difficult to love people who are irritating.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:21.500]   It's difficult to love people who are different than you.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:26.500]   It's difficult to love people who potentially might hurt you.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.500]   But people who are actually out to get you, people who are mistreating you,
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:37.500]   do good to them, and pray for them, that is not something that is within you or me.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:43.500]   Unless the love of Christ compels you, you cannot practice this.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:50.500]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 13, 4, the description of love, it says, "Love is patient."
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.500]   The word "patient" in Greek literally means "long-suffering."
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   To suffer for a long period of time. And we don't like that, right?
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.500]   Anything that causes discomfort, you know, we have to change.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.500]   I don't like my job, I change it. I don't like this relationship, I change it.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   I don't like this neighborhood, I change it.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.500]   Because we have, being rich, we have options.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.500]   So we don't like any kind of suffering for a long period of time.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.500]   So, sometimes we do that even with relationships.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   We fall in love, and just as easy as we fell in love, we fall out of love.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:33.500]   If our marriages are based upon you falling in love, you will easily fall out of love.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:39.500]   That's why when you make a covenant, it is an unconditional covenant.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:47.500]   It requires long-suffering. It's easy to fall in love, but it requires long-suffering to stay in love.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:52.500]   And so he calls us, he said the love that he called us to is a different kind of love.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:57.500]   It is an unnatural love. To continue to persevere in love.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.500]   1 Corinthians 13, 13, "But now faith, hope, love abide these three things,
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.500]   but the greatest of these is love."
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.500]   Think about that. We're saved by faith, right? By faith alone.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.500]   Our whole salvation is based upon faith.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.500]   Hope is what causes us to persevere, to make it to the end.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   And yet, of faith, of hope, and love, he said love is the greatest.
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:28.500]   Because faith without love, you missed the whole point.
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:36.500]   In fact, Paul says that at the first Timothy 1.5, he's instructing this young pastor to go fight for pure doctrine.
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   Instruct these men, instruct them, tell them, command them to stop teaching false doctrines.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:49.500]   And yet, as he is commanding them, he reminds them, he said, "But the goal of our instruction is love."
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   That in the context of fighting for pure doctrine, in the context of fighting for the pure church,
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.500]   make sure that your goal is clear, that it's love.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.500]   Because without love, it means nothing.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   Everything that we do, pursuit of holiness, has to be ultimately for love.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:11.500]   In fact, Paul says that even if you give your body to be burned,
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.500]   even if you get martyred, he says, without love, it is for nothing.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:21.500]   Even if you give your life, you did it for self-glory,
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   you did it for whatever the reason, if it is not motivated by love, he said, it is for nothing.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   Jesus practiced this love with us.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.500]   And that's why you and I are here.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.500]   That's why we worship him.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   That's why we give him glory.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   In fact, it is because of Jesus' prayer for his enemies that you and I are here.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:51.500]   In Luke chapter 23, 34, as Jesus is hanging on the cross,
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:58.500]   as he is looking at people who are mocking him, spitting on him, spearing him, humiliating him,
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:05.500]   this was Jesus' prayer, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.500]   When he tells us to pray for those who are mistreating us,
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.500]   all he's telling us to do is to reflect him,
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:19.500]   to follow him, do what he did.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:26.500]   Now, up to this point, it's like, this is impossible.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:32.500]   If you thought this is impossible, he tells us practically,
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.500]   "Okay, that's great, I can pray for them.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   I can swallow this bitter pill.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   I can try not to hate them and do something."
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:47.500]   But look what he says in Luke 29, 30, "Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also."
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   Anybody ever practice that?
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   Anybody in this room who's ever been hit, and then you turn the other cheek and say, "This one too?"
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   Most of us probably not only have not practiced it, don't remember anybody in your life.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:09.500]   And if you do, make a movie out of that person.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   Because it's just not done.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   You ever wonder why he says, "If they slap you, right?
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   If they hit you on your cheek or slap you on your cheek, turn the other cheek."
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   Why he didn't say, "If he punches you or slams you to the ground."
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:32.500]   The reason why he uses the imagery of being slapped or hit on the cheek is because it was an insult.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500]   It wasn't just for pain.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:40.500]   And the worst of the insult, if they back slapped you like that, boom.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500]   It wasn't just to hurt you.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.500]   It's basically telling that you're beneath me, you're scum.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.500]   You're not worth my time.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:51.500]   And so when they slap you, he said it's to humiliate you.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:57.500]   It's to show whoever he did it in front of that you're beneath me, you're nothing, you're scum.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:03.500]   And he says, "When that happens, turn the other cheek."
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.500]   So imagine somebody hearing this, like, "What?
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   Do you know what the Romans were doing to us?
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   Do you know what my boss is doing to me?
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   Do you know what my neighbor is like?
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500]   Turn the other cheek."
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500]   He goes further than that.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:26.500]   He says, "And whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either."
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500]   Now you and I are rich, right?
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.500]   So on Beringan Couponers, we have so many nice things, right?
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   One, because maybe it's outdated.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.500]   Maybe you gained a few pounds and it doesn't fit anymore.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   Simply because it's fall, right?
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.500]   And you've got to get rid of your fall clothes because you've got to prepare for winter.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.500]   And usually, I mean, that's where we're at.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.500]   So we don't fully understand because we're wealthy what this means.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   And average Jew at this particular time only had one coat and had one shirt.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   So when he says, "If they ask you for an outer coat, and you would have been frozen if you gave them that coat,"
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   he says, "Don't just give them the outer coat.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500]   Give them your shirt also."
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   You know what that means?
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   You know what that means?
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.500]   He has no clothes.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500]   He's to walk around in his underwear.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   They didn't wear underwear back then, so it would be even less than that, right?
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   I mean, think about that.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.500]   It's like, "What is he saying?"
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   Actually, give him everything.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   In fact, that's exactly what it says in verse 30.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   "Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back."
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   So if we were to take this literally, after this, I come and ask you for your car, right?
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.500]   You're supposed to give me your car.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   All right, let's pray.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:03.500]   If you were to practice this, like literally, "Oh, anybody who asks of you," and then if they take it away,
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.500]   "If you're not going to give it to me, and I take it away," don't call the police.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500]   Just be a good Christian.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500]   Like, suck it up, right?
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   Reflect Christ.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   What does Jesus mean here when he's telling them to give?
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.500]   He's basically calling us to die.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   For people who live their whole life building their reputation, trying to be somebody,
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   and to tell that person, "If you get slapped, turn the other cheek," is basically telling them to die.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.500]   For people who live all their lives to try to be comfortable,
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.500]   we compare, compete, compare with everybody else, and we're fine until we go to someone else's house,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   and we drive in someone else's car, and all of a sudden we don't have enough.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   And our whole pursuit in life is trying to be better than we were before.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:01.500]   And then he said, "If somebody gives to you or somebody takes away, don't fight it."
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   He's basically calling us to die.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   The things that we pursued, the things that mattered to us before we became citizens of the new kingdom,
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   he's just another way of saying, "He who wants to follow me, let him deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me."
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   The only person that would even think this is virtuous, or even attempt to apply this,
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:36.500]   is somebody who recognizes Christ as a greater treasure than your reputation.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:44.500]   That you recognize that whatever treasure you have is rubbish in light of knowing Jesus Christ.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:50.500]   Only an individual who opened their eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:58.500]   where you see treasure in Christ more than anything else that you have valued before you met Christ,
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:06.500]   can possibly even entertain turning the other cheek and losing for the sake of gaining Christ.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:13.500]   It is a call to die. It is a call to die.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:19.500]   That life that we have been pursuing before we met Christ, to crucify that,
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:25.500]   that desire to be better than before, the desire to be somebody in this world,
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.500]   it is a call to die. You cannot practice this. You cannot love your enemy.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   You cannot do good to those who are mistreating you until we crucify ourselves first.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.500]   We don't do that because we're more virtuous, or we're more disciplined, or we're better than other people.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   We simply do it because Christ is better. Because we're compelled by the love of Christ.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:59.500]   That's what he's telling us to do. In 1 Peter 2, 21-25, "For you have been called for this purpose.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.500]   Since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps,
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.500]   who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth."
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   There's only one person who has ever truly experienced injustice,
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:19.500]   because in order to experience true injustice, you have to be without sin.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:25.500]   Christ was the only one without sin, it says in verse 23, "And while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.500]   While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:38.500]   And he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   For by his wounds you were healed. You were continually straying like sheep,
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls."
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:52.500]   Everything that he's been saying up to this point, basically is Jesus saying, "Follow me.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   Follow me. Follow me.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:01.500]   What you think is going to lead to life is going to lead to destruction and curse.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.500]   You think I'm headed toward death, but I'm actually headed toward real life.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   He who drinks of this water will thirst again, but the water I give to you will well up in you in eternal life,
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   and you will never thirst again.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:19.500]   He who eats of this bread of this world, sooner or later you will go hungry again,
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:25.500]   but the bread that I give you will satisfy you for eternity."
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   Jesus is simply telling us to follow him. Follow him. This is a path to life.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   Galatians 2.20, let me conclude with this.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   I probably memorized and meditated on this verse more than any other verse in my life.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:52.500]   And the reason why is because at times when everything in my flesh doesn't want to love somebody,
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   and you know where that started?
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   With the people who are the closest to me.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   People who are the closest to me. Because the people who are not close to me,
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   all I have to do is stiff-arm them and, you know, just don't be around them.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   They're acquaintances, but they're not people I need to love.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   But you can't escape from your wife. You can't escape from your children.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   So I remember early on in marriage when I'd be so frustrated and she would go to sleep,
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   I would sit there memorizing, "I have been crucified with Christ. Die. Die."
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.500]   In order for me to learn how to love my wife, I needed to die first.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   That voice inside of me saying, "This is not fair," needs to die.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:45.500]   That voice inside of me that seeks justice needs to die.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.500]   In order for me to practice the love that Christ loved me with,
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.500]   I needed to first learn to die to myself.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   In order to love her as Christ loved her, loved me.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   Every time God convicts me to do something that I don't want to do,
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   I have been crucified with Christ. I am crucified. You're dead. You're dead.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   It is no longer I who live. The I in me that refuses to love anybody difficult to love.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   The I in me that wants to retaliate every time somebody tries to hurt me.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   The I in me that wants my reputation to be restored.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   The I in me. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:40.500]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God,
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:46.500]   who loved me and gave himself for me.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   As impossible as this may sound, as impossible as it may appear,
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:11:00.500]   Christ is simply telling us to follow his steps.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   True life, true life is found at the center of the will of God.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   We're going to talk next week of why this is so important.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.500]   What are the practical ramifications of following these commands?
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   And I think it will make a lot more sense when we wrap it up next week.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:30.500]   My prayer is, sometimes even the way we follow Christ, it is to glorify ourselves.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   Better life, better job, better friendship, better marriage.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:42.500]   We're still not dead. We just find Jesus to be an avenue to get what we were pursuing before we met Christ.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:46.500]   Except Jesus is an easier path.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   Until we die to ourselves, until the things that we learned, we put away,
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:58.500]   you'll never fully understand when Jesus said, "I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly."
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:04.500]   My prayer is that we would all know this life and be compelled by the love of Christ.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:12.500]   Let's pray.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.500]   Let's take a few minutes as our worship team comes and leads us,
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.500]   to come before the Lord and ask, "Lord, search me and know me. See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:29.500]   Things that I have excused. The bitterness and anger that I've allowed to bear fruit in my heart."
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:34.500]   That God would reveal these things to us.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:40.500]   That we would offer up worship, truly in spirit and in truth.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:45.500]   Let's come before the Lord and let the word of God richly dwell in us.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.500]   And His word bear fruit.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.500]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team guides and leads us.

[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:38.500]   (Piano music)

[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.500]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.500]   and the fellowship and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:37.500]   and the eternal powerful love of God the Father,
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:43.500]   rest, restore, empower, and compel us
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.500]   to be the aroma of Christ wherever you send us this week.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.500]   Amen.
