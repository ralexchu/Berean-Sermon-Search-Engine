[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   provision in our lives. We pray, Father God, that every word that you've spoken,
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000]   every word that you, that we've studied and will discuss,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   will serve to strengthen your church and cause us, Lord God, to be mindful
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   of all that we have in you. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I hope that through your study and through your quiet times and,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   you know, answering some of these questions that you've recognized that there's
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   been some transition, yes? Without me pointing it out?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Which I already did, right? Clearly the tone is different.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   The tone, like there is, chapter 1 through chapter 39, the tone is,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   is judgment coming, why the judgment is coming, who the judgment is coming for,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   how long the judgment is, and then in between God would make promises of,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   even though that's happening, God's going to restore you. But in chapter 40 and on,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   you'll see that the tone primarily is about comfort. Now, that doesn't mean that
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   God doesn't mention judgment. Judgment is still there, but you'll notice that
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   the tone is very different. Have you noticed that another transition
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   between chapter 39 and 40? Besides the tone?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   [no audio]
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   History, like in what way?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   [no audio]
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Okay, alright, that's good observation. So you'll notice that in between chapter 39
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and chapter 40, where chapter up to that point is talking about what's going to
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   happen because of their sins, and then starting from chapter 40, he begins to
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   explain what happened, right? Why this happened, and so basically what's
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   happening starting from chapter 40, there's about, so chapter 39 to 40,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   basically what's happened is the Assyrians came and then they fell.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   God already judged the Assyrians. Up to this point, up to chapter 39,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   it's been judgment against the nation of Israel, right? So judgment has taken
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   place, and then again, it doesn't mention Assyria, it doesn't mention Persia,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   it doesn't mention Babylonians by name, but if you look at the historical
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   context, that's basically what happens, right? He raises up a nation from the
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   east, right, to bring judgment, and so most commentators believe that's talking
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   about the Assyrians who were judged, they've already been conquered. The
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Babylonians already came and conquered them, but it goes even beyond that. It
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   talks about probably King Cyrus who's come and allowed them to restore back
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   into Jerusalem, okay? So about 100, 120 years of history already took place,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and so starting from chapter 40, he begins to look at it and say, "This is what
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I've done, and this is why I did it." And the whole reason why is now he's coming
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   to comfort and to restore, okay? So that's a big shift in chapter 40, right?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, that doesn't mean starting from chapter 40 that it's going to be
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   chronological. Just like chapter 1 through 39, it's very thematic, so he may
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   jump back and forth, he may be talking about the restorations of Jerusalem, and
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   then go back and then talk about judgment against Babylon. So he'll do that
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   also in the second section, but again you'll notice that the tone has
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   definitely changed, okay? So if you look at the first chapter, or chapter 40,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   verse 1, "Come forth, come forth, my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended." Okay, so all the
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   judgment that was prophesied in the first 39 chapters, he said all of that
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   has ended. Okay, again not completely, just historically. All the stuff
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   prophesied about the end times obviously hasn't happened yet. But the
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   historical application, he says, "Warfare has ended, that her iniquity is
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   pardoned," right? All this time saying, "Because of your sins, these judgments
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   are coming." God carries out his judgment, and now they're taken into captivity,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   and then now they're returning back to Jerusalem. Okay, so all of that has
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   already taken place between chapter 39 and 40. "That she has received from the
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Lord's hand double for all her sins." Right? So as much as they were judged for
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   their sins, when God restores, His restoration is going to be double,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   whatever it is that they lost, right? So that's the context in which we're
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   starting. Okay, so the first question, "Why is a valley lifted up a mountain, and
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   a hill made low, to prepare for the coming of the Lord?" Okay, again it
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   doesn't say within that context, remember we talked about that, how all the roads,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   right, that leads to the, what cities? Cities of refuge. How many cities of
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   refuge were there? There were six of them, and where were they?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Huh? They're all spread out in Jerusalem, on top of the hills, right? And they're
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   all Levitical towns, where the Levites basically were the residents in
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   those towns, right? So it doesn't mention that in specifically, but any Jew would
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   know, and like when talking about the best roads, is talking about cities that,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   the roads that lead to the, to the cities of refuge. But again, when it's talking
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   about the mountains being, being taken down, and valleys being lifted up, what is
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   the imagery there? Just making the, making the road easy access, right? So that the
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   mountains, they don't have to climb mountains, they don't have to go down the
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   valley. What's another metaphor for that? High being brought low, low being brought
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   high, proud humbled, right? The lowly being, being brought up, right? When I think
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   about that, the picture that I always get is in John chapter 3 and 4, where Nicodemus,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   you know, he's a spiritually or by, by law, he's kind of on the top of the hill.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And then you have the Samaritan woman, the next chapter, who's kind of like the
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   sin, sinner among sinners, and even other sinners wouldn't associate with her, how
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   God interacts with both of them. And he brings the high low and the low high,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   right? So that's the kind of picture we get. It's to make the path to the Lord
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   the easiest and the quickest.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You know, that's another imagery. When we talk about the gospel, you know, the
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   barrier that existed between us and God has been taken away. So again, that's
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   another picture of the, of the gospel message, where the roads that were, were
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   impossible to take, the mountains have been brought low, the valleys have been
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   filled, so that our path to our God has been, has been laid, right? Again, as I
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   mentioned, the other imagery is for the, the proud to be humbled and the lowly to
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   be raised up. And that's exactly what the gospel does, doesn't it? Right? The proud
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and the mighty and the honored and the educated, they don't have special access
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   to the kingdom, right? And the lowly and the poor, the uneducated, the ungifted,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   they have equal access to God, right? The gospel brings us all through the same
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   door, right? And so after so much warning God's wrath against the enemies of
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Israel and His discipline against Israel, God now turns to restore what He has
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   always intended, to restore and comfort Israel. They will receive double the
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   blessing than punishment for sins, just as I, we read in verse 2, right? That she
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins, right? So just as they
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   have been judged, God will pardon them, not much more.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   So again, the period of discipline is, is over, now God will restore.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   So what, when He comes to do this, what will be revealed? Right? It says the glory of
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   the Lord. Can somebody go to Colossians 3, 4?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Martin, can you go to Colossians 3, 4?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And then Shane, can you go to 1st Corinthians 13, 11? And just read it out
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   loud for us.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Yeah, Colossians 3, verse 4.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Okay, so whenever we, the Bible prophesies about Him coming, it says that we will see
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Him in His full glory. And in His glory, His being, being able to have access to
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   His glory is what's going to change us, right? 1st Corinthians?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Okay, so 1st Corinthians 13 talks about how everything that we've experienced about
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   God is only partial, right? Like the theologians say, we're here and not yet.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   We've gotten a taste of His kingdom, taste of His goodness, taste of His glory,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   but His full revelation of Himself is going to come when He comes in His full
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   glory, right?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So again, if verse 9 through 11 describes Him coming in might, right? But along with
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Him coming in His might, in His full glory, God is described as a caring, gentle
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   shepherd that takes care of His flock in tenderness, right?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   So again, the image is very different, right? When He was talking about judgment,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   He's talking about His might, He's talking about His power, and He still does that
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   in this section, but He comes to restore. And in gentleness, He cares for this
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   flock that has gone astray. And again, the imagery that we have is, you know,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   when He says that He leaves a 99 to go chase after the 1, and that's the imagery
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   that we see here. When the Lord comes in His full glory, He's come to restore.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   So there's a tenderness in Him, there's a gentleness in Him that's drawing His
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   lost sheep back to Him.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Third question was, what do verses 6 through 8 teach us about God's word
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   compared to everything else, right?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Only God's word does not change. So everything He has said has happened,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   right? Where first 39 chapters were like, "This is going to happen, this is going
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   to happen," and He's warning them to turn from their sins, right? And then it
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   happens. Now He's returning back and He says, "See, everything I said has
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   happened." Like, everything like grass will fade away and disappear, but the word
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   of God will be fulfilled. This is why I think that, you know, faith ultimately is
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   something that God gives, but how do we, what avenue did God give us so that our
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   faith can grow? Faith comes from hearing, right? Hearing the word of Christ, right?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Faith comes from hearing and hearing the word of Christ. So here He says, He tells
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   them, "This is what's going to happen." Now He's looking back and He says, "Just
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   like everything else, like everything has passed away, everything that you've
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   relied on, right? You've been running to Egypt. Where are they now? You were
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   afraid of Assyria. Where are they now? You were aligning yourself with the
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Babylonians. They've been judged. They've disappeared, right? So where are they
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   now?" He's saying, "Everything that you've relied on, all the confidence that you
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   have, they've all disappeared, and now you're on this end. What remains for you?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   His word, right? The only thing that was constant was His word, His promise." So
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   when He says His word, obviously He's not talking about the pages of His word.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   He's talking about God Himself. "Everything I tell you is going to happen."
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's basically what He's saying, right? So instead of relying upon the
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Egyptians when you were running to them, you should have relied upon Me and My
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   words. That's basically what He's saying. He's not simply saying, like, you know,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   this is just cling on to this, right? He said, "If you're going to put your
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   confidence in anything, put your confidence in what I tell you, in the
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   promises that I make, right? If you fear anything, fear Me, right?"
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Okay, I had one question on Friday. "It takes some time to list all the
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   different attributes of God listed in this section. Be as detailed as
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   possible." Okay, so instead of just going over it, let me give you just a few
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   minutes in your table to discuss in that section what are some things that you
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   found, okay? Because every promise that God, when He says, you know, all the
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   stuff, all the other things are like grass, they pass away, only His word
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   lasts forever. We're just talking about what He said, right? So recognizing and
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   understanding who He is and believing who He is, is at the foundation upon
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   what they will build on top, right? So what does He say? How is God presented
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   to us, at least in this section? So take a few minutes to talk about what you
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   found, what are some things that kind of stood out to you, right? Not just like,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "Oh, he says this, he says this," but what kind of stood out to you that gives
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   you confidence? When you think about God, "This is something that really like
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   causes me to have confidence and strength. This is what causes me to run
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   to Him," right? That you can put your trust in Him because of this. Not just
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   objectively, but subjectively. Don't do your study now, okay? Discuss what you
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   found, okay?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   [Pause]
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   If you guys can just...if I can get your attention back up here for a minute.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   So again, you know, we're not talking about objectively, you know, we all know
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   how to read. I'm asking you guys like, "What kind of stood out to you? What are
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   some things that kind of stands out and say, 'This is what I think about and that
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   gives me confidence and strength.'" Right? Share your blessing with all of us.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   [Pause]
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   So how does that comfort you? How does that give you strength?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   [Audience member] It tells me that, like, you know, this stuff about ISIS going on,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   communities of hopeless, but God, He has all of this in mind already, no matter
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   what happens.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   [Ross] So it gives you...so it gives you peace that you...okay.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   [Audience member] As I looked at verse 30 and 31, it made me think about how God is
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   our source of life, and He's not only the source, but He's the sustainer. So how it
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   applies to me is, I guess, over the years of us being involved in church, I hear, you
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   know, I've heard from different people this phrase of "burnout." I burned out, you
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   know, because, you know, when I first started something, I just did it, like, to the max.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And then I got burned out. So then I stopped. But I realized that, you know, as I've been
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   evaluating, kind of, even the last five, ten years, I think it's been a good, I think,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   kind of, it's been evident to me that God has, I think, helped me do it in my spirit.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So if I'm going through a busy weekend or a busy month, I'm like, how could I get up
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   for a walk, and I'll jump in. But, certainly, I trust that it's not because I'm in
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   juvenile, and automatically, in general, I'm not, you know, in my spirit.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   >> Right. Right. Yeah, I think that's crucial. I mean, that's kind of like the main point
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   he's making, right? He's talking to the nation of Israel, who's constantly jumping
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   to, you know, like, other nations, or wealth, or political power, and then when it got bad
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   enough, they jumped to idols, right? And in the end, and now he's looking back at
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   this, see what happened, what did that buy you? What happened? At that moment, you felt
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   secure, but when you look at the totality of what happened, it's like they're all
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   gone. The only thing that remained was God, right? And I think that, again, throughout
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   our spiritual maturity, as we're growing, I mean, we're human, so we're motivated by
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   all kinds of stuff, right? Came here motivated by the snacks, right? We saw the
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   pictures, and we're motivated, right? We're motivated by our friends, we're
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   motivated by community. None of these things are bad, right? But in time,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   everything is going to change. Everything is going to disappoint to a certain
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   degree, right? The only thing that remains that consistent forever, and he says, "He
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   who waits upon the Lord, he'll renew his strength," right? People wait upon people,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   people wait upon organization, people wait upon anything. At some point, yeah,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   burnout's going to happen because disappointment's going to come, right? I
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   don't think it's wrong. I don't think those things are necessarily wrong, but
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   God has a tendency to kind of bring you through all of that to make you see that
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   the only thing constant is God, right? And he who waits upon the Lord, they're the
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   ones who are going to renew the strength. So that's really the point that he's
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   trying to make through all of this, right? Okay, what else? Have we exhausted it
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   already? What else? What did you guys talk about in your group? Let's have a couple
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   more people share.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   [inaudible]
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   [inaudible]
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Right. Like it says in verse 27, "Why do you say with Jacob, 'And speak, O Israel,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   my ways is hidden from the Lord, and my right is disregarded by my God,'" because
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   he wasn't answering right away. It seemed like God doesn't care, right? And
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   sometimes God allows us to go through all of that so that we figure out that God
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   is exactly what we want, right? Okay, let's have one or two more people share.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   [inaudible]
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   How does that comfort you?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   [inaudible]
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I think I shared this many times before, but the thing that always stands out to
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   me is his immutability, right? Like he doesn't change. He does not faint or grow
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   weary. I think the older I get, the more that, like how important that is, because
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   everything changes. Everything changes. Like everything changes. Anyway, I don't
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   want to milk it. It just seems like the older I get, the more like to see
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   something constant because nothing is constant, and to know that all the
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   attributes of God is constant. The God that I met over 30 years ago is the same
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   God, has the same passion, same love, the same forgiveness. Like it's the same.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And the fact that he did not grow weary, he did not grow tired, even when I'm
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   tired, even when I grow weary, like that's a comfort. You know what I mean?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Kind of like, you know those of you who've been out of your, you know, you're
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   old enough, you've moved out of your house, you haven't lived in your home for a
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   long time, and every once in a while you go back to your parents' home and you
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   just feel safe. Does that happen? Yeah, sometimes, right? You know what I'm
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   talking about, right? It's kind of like that. Like it's like going to your God
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   is always like he's the same God. That same God that heard you crying when you
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   were lonely and beaten up, and you know, when you felt like he wouldn't forgive
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   your sin, he came back and he received you, and all of that, all of that. He's
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   that same God. You go to him today, he's that same God. Nothing has changed, right?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So to me that's a huge source of comfort, to know that that's the same God I knew
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   30 years ago is the same God I know today. Okay, you don't have to write this
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   down. These are just, these are the objective things that are talked about,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   right? He's sovereign, he's all-knowing, he's immutable, he gives power to those
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   who faint.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   The challenge is not to simply know this, but to experience this, right? That's the
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   challenge. It's easy to know this, and we have the Bible, but how is this fleshed
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   out in your life? How is his sovereignty, like, how does that affect your
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   decision-making? How does this cause you not to fear what's going on? Just like,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   you know, why I wanted you guys to share in your group is not simply say, "Oh,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   this is what the Bible says about God." But how does his immutability affect you,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   affect your affection for him? How does the fact that God is unsearchable,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   all-knowing, right? How does that affect your life? The fact that he provides
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   water for the thirsty, right? Where there's no water to be found, but then
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   it's in Christ. Like, how does that affect you? That's the challenge for us.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Like, how is that real in our lives? Like, how is that being fleshed out?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Alright, so let's transition to chapter 41. So chapter 41, he begins in verse 1,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and says, "Listen to me in silence, O coastlands, let the peoples renew their
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   strength. Let them approach, then let them speak. Let us together draw near for
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   judgment." So that part where he says, "Let them approach, then let them speak,"
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   right? So he's basically gathering all the peoples, and before you go around and
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   tell people about who I am, what I have done, come and listen first, right? He's
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   going to lay out who he is, and he's going to show them. So in what way? The
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   first question was in verse 4. In what way is he the first and the last? So
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   let's look at it in the context. "Who stirred up one of the east from the
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   victory, meets at every step." And so, most commentators believe that that's in
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   reference to Persia. Persia coming in from the east, conquering the Babylonians,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and he gives up nations before him so that he tramples kings underfoot. He
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   makes them like dust with his sword, like drawn, driven stubble with his bow. He
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   pursues them and passes on safely by path his feet have not trod. "Who has
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   performed and done this, calling the generation from the beginning, I the
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Lord the first and with the last, I am he." So all these nations, these are all
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   superpowers, right? And at the time they were in power, it seemed like, how can
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   you possibly destroy the Assyrians? But they went. And when the Babylonians, that
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   was the most powerful empire, probably before any other empire, before the
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Roman Empire came, the Babylonians were the greatest empire ever, right? But even
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   they disappeared. At one point, Egyptians seemed like, you know, like how can
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Egyptians, who's going to conquer the Egyptians? But they came and went. And now
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   the Persia here is in power, and he said, "These are my servants." Right? As
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   powerful as they are, I am the first and the last, not them, right? So he has
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   absolute sovereign control. That's why he's laying out all these nations have
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   come and gone, right? But in the end, they only do what I have purposed, because I
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   am the first and I am the last. I remember years ago, a missionary was
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   sharing about, you know, a book of Revelation, and I said, "Okay, this guy's
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   going to go talk about, you know, what the white horse is and all that." But I was
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   really encouraged because he was sharing from Revelation, like the end history,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   right? And he said, after he shared that, he was basically sharing with us how
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   book of Revelation comforts him, because the end history is already determined.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   He's not predicting. He's saying like, "Oh, if you make the right choices, and if
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   you make the right, you know, place the right thing, and if the church works
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   hard enough, and if we spread the gospel, if we were strategic enough, if we
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   gathered enough, like we're going to be able to do this." He said, "No, that's not
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   what Revelation is saying." Right? Revelation is saying, "This is what's
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   going to happen." He conquered, period. Right? He's not saying, "It wasn't a
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   challenge to get your act straight, or this is not going to happen." He said,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   "No, this is determined." Right? And so, he was sharing how every time he
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   reads the book of Revelation, it kind of reminds him that we're playing a small
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   part in the way he's carrying his plan out, but in the end, it's already been
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   determined. Right? And a source of confidence in that, and in the end, like,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   you know, we get so caught up in what we need to do, don't need to do, and we
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   forget the big picture. Right? This is a sovereign God we're talking about. God
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   has never lost control of anything. Right? So, he is the Alpha and Omega, not the
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   United States, not ISIS, not our economy, you know, not our intellect, not our
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   decision-making, but him. Right? Ultimately, what was the cause of fear?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Right? And he said, "Why are they commanded not to be fearful?" So, look at
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   verse 6. It says 6, it's 670, but I forgot to erase the zero. Okay? What is he
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   saying here? "Everyone helps his neighbor and says to his brother, 'Be strong.'
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer, him
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, 'It is good,' and they
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   strengthen it with nails so that it cannot be moved." What is he saying there?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   >>Sounds like the pagan idol worshippers are wavering in their own faith toward
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   their idols, and so they're encouraging the craftsman to do a better job making
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   idols so that the idols don't fall over. Such is the weakness of their own trust
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   in their false gods, because God, the true God, is judging them and causing them to
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   be shaken up and poured out. >>Right. Did you guys catch that? You see how verse 5
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   says, "The coastlines have seen and are afraid. The ends of the earth tremble.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   They have drawn near and come." So all this disaster is happening, and so when
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   that happens, they're going to each other and comforting each other, right? Which
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   is exactly what we do, you know? When disaster comes, we send email, we say,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   "Hey, we're with you," and we try to bring comfort. And then it said, "The
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   craftsman strengthened goldsmith." In other words, whether it is idols that
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   they're building, or they're just kind of fortifying their walls. So it's like if
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   disaster is coming, make sure we get proper insurance, you know? Like we put up
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   boards against the windows, and we're doing everything in your power to protect
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   yourself. But in the end, what happens? Nothing. The winds are too strong, right?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   The disaster is not something that you can hold back, right? So he's saying when
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   disaster comes, the men are running to each other for comfort. They're running,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   like they're going to work harder, right? "Hey, we don't have, the economy is bad,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   so let's be smart, let's work harder." And he said, "In the end, what has it done?"
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Right? Only the Word of God lasts forever. So they're trying to deal with their
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   fear by running to things that really aren't going to help them. Whether it's
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   hard work, or idolatry. But he says to the nation of Israel, he said, "But your
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   comfort," right? In verses 8 through 10. This is what they do, verses 6 through 7.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   "But you, Israel, my servant Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   my friend, you whom I took from the ends of the earth and called from his farthest
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   corner, saying to you, 'You are my servant, I have chosen you,' and not cast you off.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Fear not, for I am with you. Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Right? So the world will run to each other. They'll run to hard work, they'll
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   run to idolatry, whatever it is that brings comfort. But he said, "You, your
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   source of strength should not be like the others." Right? He said, "You shouldn't
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   fear because I am with you." Right? Not because you have friends, not because
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   you have a bank account, right? Not because you're part of a good community
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   that loves you, but your fear should be dealt with because I am with you. I have
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   chosen you. Right?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   What will happen to those who contend with God? Right? Those who war against
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Israel will perish, basically, in verses 11 and 12. In other words, after all these
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   years, right? After all these years of their rebellion, after all these years of
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   God's judgment upon them, God has still not forgotten about His people.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Do you remember when Hosea was written? Was it pre-exile or post-exile?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Anybody remember? Pre. Right? Hosea is written pre-exile.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Do you remember the theme of Hosea? He names his children, "You are not my
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   people. I will not have compassion." Basically, he's saying that, "I loved you
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   like Hosea loves Gomer." He chased after Harlot who kept on adulterating
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   themselves. And God warns the nation of Israel that because of that, judgment
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   is coming upon you. Right? And so, he says in his judgment, "I'm going to treat
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   you like you're not my people. I'm going to let you go. If you're going to keep
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   adulterating yourself, you're going to do that." And now we're here. So, this is
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   written, obviously, post-exile. Right? And even after all of that, even after all
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   his frustration, God has still not forgotten about Israel. Right? He's saying,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   "You are my people." He's still saying that to this nation. Right? So, when you
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   look at the history of Israel and just how often and how many times and how
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   easily they forget who they serve. You know, and God disciplines them. God doesn't
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   just sweep sin under the rug. He disciplines them. But he still, still he's
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   saying, "You're my people." Right? Because he made a covenant. He said, "Everything
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   else will pass away. You may frustrate your parents. You may frustrate your
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   friends. You may, you know, you may have even your best friends may not be there
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   next year. But the Word of God will remain forever." Right? Because he said, he
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   said, he made a covenant with Abraham. Right? And he is faithful to his own
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   covenant. And so, even now, right, when you understand the context in which he's
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   saying this, even now he says, "You're my people. And anybody who messes with you
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   messes with me." Right? "In what way will he protect them?" He said, "I will hold you
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   with my right hand." Right? "I will, I will be the one who helps you."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   [Pause]
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   "The Lord will send the kinsman-redeemer." I mean, it's, in your translation, it
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   doesn't, it doesn't say "kinsman-redeemer," but basically that's the same word.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Right? "Boaz, who comes and redeems." Right? It's written into the law of God
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   that a kinsman-redeemer will come, the nearest kin will come and redeem, redeem
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   that line. He said, "I will send him." Who is this in reference to?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Christ. Right? So again, a reference that his ultimate restoration is going to come
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   in Christ. You notice how in verse 14, that even in the context of his judgment
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   and restoration, he says, "Fear not, you worm Jacob." Right? Just in case you become
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   arrogant, thinking that somehow you've earned my favor. Right? Don't forget,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   right, it's not because you're righteous, it's not because you've paid off your
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   sin and now you're righteous before God. He said, "Don't forget, you worm Jacob,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   you men of Israel. I am the one who helps you," declares the Lord. Right? In other
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   words, God's having compassion on you. "Your redeemer, kinsman-redeemer, is the
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Holy One of Israel. Behold, I make you a threshing sledge." So, you see how he
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   says, "You are a worm, but I will turn you into a threshing sledge, because I will
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   have compassion on you." Right? So, for whatever the reason, because God has
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   mercy on you, you start becoming arrogant. Don't forget who you are. I'm the one
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   who's being gracious to you. He says, "The Lord will answer the needy and those who
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   seek water, and not abandon them." That even in the, even as you're in the
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   desert and there's no hope for life. Right? He said, "I will provide."
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   [Pause]
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   So, who's the Lord speaking to in this section? Starting in verse 21, when He
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   says, "Set forth your case," says the Lord, "bring your proof," says the King of
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Jacob, "let them bring them and tell us what is to happen. Tell us the former
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   things, what they are, that we may consider them, that we may know their
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   outcome, or declare to us the kings to come." Who is He referring to?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   [Pause]
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Huh? I didn't do "eat"? Oh, okay, I didn't. So, He says, "When He does all of this,"
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   in verse 20, "that they may see and know, may consider and understand together, that
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   the hand of the Lord has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created." So, again,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   He starts in verse 16, "Fear not, you worm Jacob." In other words, don't become
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   arrogant because God is being gracious to you. Because, remember what the
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Scripture says? Right? The constant sin of the nation of Israel and the people of
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   God is when they cry out, God has compassion, He feeds them. When they are
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   fed, they become proud. When they become proud, they forget Him. And when they
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   forget Him, they turn to idols. Right? And that's the constant cycle. So, He says,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   "I'm going to restore you, but don't forget it is I who will restore you, not
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   you." Right? That's why, again, I think, you know, as we talked about on Sunday,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   justification by faith, right? Meaning that in the end, we didn't earn it. So,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   anytime we see any kind of pride in our righteousness, that's the beginning of
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   the fall. Right? So, who's the Lord speaking to, verse 21 and on?
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Who's He referring to?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Huh?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Who?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Judah.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Judah. Okay.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Is there a why you say Judah?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It just seems, well, I put Judah question mark. And it was just, because it seemed
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   like there was this aspect of, like, because Judah was like the better of the
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   two kingdoms as far as like following Him. So, there's this aspect, like, for me,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   it seemed like there was this strength of, like, or a strength of, like, that
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   parent talked to their child, like, "I don't want to punish you. Like, tell me
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   why. I'm like, just please give me a good reason why." So, that's, it just, that
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   was my, preserving the right.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Okay. Okay. Anybody else?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Could it be idols? Like, God's calling their idols into account. What's you
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   telling what's going to happen in the future if you're so powerful and Judah's
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   insisting on worshipping you? Well, prove it. You know, here's my proof, here's
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   my qualifications in Most chapter 40. What do you got? So, God's, it sounds like
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   He's challenging your idols.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Right. Right. I think it pretty much includes everything. Like, everybody and
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   everyone who didn't put their confidence in God, right, He's looking back and
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   saying, "Why don't you predict? Why don't you thwart the nation? You know, let's
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   see you predict what's going to happen. You tell me what's going to happen
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   tomorrow." But it's kind of a bit of sarcasm. You know what I mean? And so, He's
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   basically taking it to them. It's like, "See all the things that you've trusted,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   all the false prophets you went to, all the priests that you've relied on, all
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   the other nations, all the other idols, right, where are they now? You know, tell
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   them to save you. Where are they now?" Right? Right. So, basically, He's
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   challenging them. Like, now He's on this side and we have 120 years of God, God
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   judging, preserving, restoring, right, doing exactly what He said He was going
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   to do. And He's looking back at it and saying, "Now look at all the things that
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   you've been, you've had confidence in. Where are they now?" Right? Were they able
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   to accomplish anything that they said? Did anything they say come true? Right?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Remember the last week we talked about in chapter 36 through 39? Remember how the
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   general of the Assyrian army comes and he begins to mock Israel and say, "Where's
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   your God? If there is a God, He's for us and not for you." Right? He's like, "Hezekiah
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   is not going to be able to save you. You watch." Right? So, kind of like, now we go
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   to chapter 41 and say, "Where are they now?" You think about everything He said.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Did that come true? Right? All right. So, the last part of it is, consider how
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Israel saw, and this is one of your, the last question. "Idols time and again in
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   their history, when it is end, it is nothing but man-made objects. Why would a
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   nation favored by the living God be so tempted by something so trivial? Why does
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   the sin of idol worship in Israel's history reveal about, what does it reveal
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   about the sin that resides in all of us?" This temptation to, you know, I know, I
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   know at church on Sunday, and I know in Bible study, and I know in small groups,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   God is huge. Right? But in our day-to-day lives, that's our struggle. That this
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   same God that we talk about in this room, is He, is He big in our daily lives?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Right? And I think that temptation, you know, like everything that we see in the
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   nation of Israel, we struggle with the same temptation on a day-to-day basis.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   You know, we look at it in history and say, "Why would a nation who's been
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   favored by God, protected by God, loved by God, you know, seen the miracles of
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   God, so easily turn away and turn to idols?" Because that's all in us too.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Right? We wrestle with that. So, that question, I'm just going to leave it up
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   to you. Take some time to discuss in your group, and I'll just kind of end it
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   All right.
