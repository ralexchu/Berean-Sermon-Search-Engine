[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180]   I know we're all excited this morning to come
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.900]   and to worship, to remember what Christ has done for us
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.900]   and to celebrate Christ and as Christ our savior,
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.580]   Christ the newborn King,
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.740]   who brings joy and peace to this world.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.380]   So as we begin this morning with our service,
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.740]   let us come with gladness and with joy.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.820]   And so we're gonna start with the song Christmas Offering.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.160]   ("Christmas Offering")

[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:22.100]   - All right, good morning.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.500]   Welcome to our annual Christmas service.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.880]   And as you guys know, can see by the setup
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.620]   that we have a special presentation.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.460]   We have choir, we have our children's ministry
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.580]   gonna come up and I know some of you guys
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.740]   came to see your nieces, nephews, grandchildren.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.340]   So we'll let you know when it's time
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.020]   for you to take out your cameras and take pictures.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.980]   But obviously that's gonna be happening soon.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.020]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.860]   We have a mission team going out to South Korea
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.980]   in a few weeks and so they have a hoodie fundraiser
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.580]   going on and it's gonna be going on every Sunday
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.100]   until they leave in about two weeks, I believe,
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100]   two or three weeks.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.060]   And so if you go outside, there's a table out there
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.340]   where you can purchase the hoodies
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.020]   and those funds will help support some of them
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.860]   that are going out to the missions.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.860]   On New Year's Eve, we have a ping pong tournament
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.100]   that happens at 5 p.m. before we have our service at 11.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.820]   And so if you're planning to participate, please sign up.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.500]   Today is the last day you can sign up.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.380]   It is a doubles tournament.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.700]   So you can go out there and sign up for that.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.940]   And again, you don't have to be too skilled.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.860]   You can just come and participate.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.380]   So today is the last day to sign up,
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.540]   so make sure you sign up for that.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.220]   Again, today, after you go out,
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.180]   there'll be a table where you can sign up.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.740]   Today, after the Christmas or after the service,
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.220]   if you go out to the courtyard,
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.300]   you'll see a table with a white tablecloth.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.580]   There's some cookies on the table.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.700]   And so Pastor Mark and some of our outreach team members
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.340]   are gonna be stationed over there.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.860]   So after the service, if you come and visited us as a guest
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.180]   and you have some questions
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.980]   and you want some clarification on certain things,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.500]   if you could visit that table,
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.580]   then they'll be able to answer
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.260]   any kind of questions that you have.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.020]   And so that table is reserved for us.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.660]   If you go out, again, as you're exiting,
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.100]   where all the planters are, that's where the table is.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.980]   So please, we invite you to come and visit that table.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.900]   And then finally, today is our last day
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.860]   that we're gonna be connecting
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.740]   for the Lottie Moon Christmas mission offering.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   And so if you are planning to give to the missions offering
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.500]   to support our missionaries overseas,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.020]   please make sure you designate that
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.700]   as Lottie Moon missions offering when you give.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.980]   And then again, that offering will go to support
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.220]   our missionaries that we're supporting overseas,
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.140]   okay, through the IMB.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.940]   Okay, let me ask the choir to come up.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.580]   And as they come, I'm gonna pray for our offering
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.700]   once they begin to set up here.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.760]   And then after they're done,
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.180]   the children are gonna come up
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.280]   and they're gonna do their presentation as well.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.260]   So let me get it.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.860]   When a good number of them are here,
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.020]   I'll pray for the offering.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.380]   Again, so if you have a physical offering,
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.500]   there's a box in the back.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.720]   As you go out, it'll say offering.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.980]   You can drop it off there.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.460]   Otherwise, we'll give you a minute to give your offering.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.700]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.820]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.140]   for what this day means to all of us.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.360]   Help us, Lord God, to give you our full heart,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.560]   that we would worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.120]   Help us to understand what it is that you've given us
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.520]   so that we would respond appropriately, reasonably.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.460]   I pray that our singing, our giving,
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.480]   all of it, Lord God, may bring glory to your name.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.760]   And I pray that the offering that we give now
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.840]   that greater and greater glory would come to you.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.680]   We thank you, Father.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.840]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.680]   Amen.

[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.020]   - You know, I wanna read something to you.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.020]   It's gonna take about three, four minutes,
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:39.020]   but I wanna read this to you as I conclude my sermon
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.020]   because I've been looking for my journal
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.020]   probably for over 10 plus years.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.020]   This is a journal that I wrote
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.020]   while I was out on the street for a few days.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.020]   I think I shared with you in the past
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.020]   that there was a period where I thought
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:56.020]   when Esther and I first met
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:59.020]   that we were gonna be doing homeless ministry full time.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.020]   And so I wanted to go out on the street
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.020]   and experience what it was like,
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.020]   even if it was a short period of time,
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.020]   just to see what it is exactly that they needed.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.020]   And so by God's providence,
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.020]   somehow I was looking for something else,
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.020]   and I found this journal.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.020]   So I wanted to read a portion of,
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.020]   and there's a point that I'm trying to make.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:22.020]   So be patient with me as I read to you
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:26.020]   what I wrote down while I was there for a few days.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:30.020]   On March 26th to March 28th, 1991,
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.020]   I went to stay among the homeless to see how they lived.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.020]   After feeding the homeless people,
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.020]   everyone left at 8.45 p.m.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.020]   It was pouring rain that night.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.020]   When everyone left, I stayed behind with one backpack
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.020]   containing a notebook, Bible, and a book to read.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   I stayed with four homeless friends that I made.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.020]   They were laughing and amused that I would sleep with them.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.020]   They didn't think that I would be able to last one night.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.020]   It began to really pour down around 9.30 p.m.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.020]   Fernando fixed the blankets in such a way
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.020]   that five of us would be snuggled together in a small area
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.020]   with a small piece of blanket to cover all of us.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020]   Angel, Fernando, Jorge, and another friend, Martin,
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.020]   had to sleep by himself because he came late.
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.020]   I didn't want to be too assertive
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020]   in voicing my ideas or opinions
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.020]   because I didn't wish to offend anyone
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.020]   in their own home, in quotes.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.020]   It wasn't as cold at first, but around 11 p.m.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.020]   the cold winds began to blow,
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.020]   and three of us shared one blanket,
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   the one that I took out there for myself.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.020]   I slept or tried next to Jorge.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:36.020]   We were so snug I couldn't even move my arms.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.020]   Every hour I looked at my watch
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.020]   and hoping that the time would pass faster.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.020]   It was a long, cold, rainy night.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.020]   During the night I heard loud sirens many times,
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.020]   but the sounds didn't seem to bother any of the other guys.
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.020]   Angel woke up at 5.30 a.m.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.020]   and woke up Jorge to a lady's home about three blocks away.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.020]   It was raining very hard.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.020]   I was hoping that they would wait until the rain stopped,
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.020]   but they walked right through the rain.
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.020]   Jorge had to jump the fence to let Angel and I
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   into the apartment complex.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.020]   Fernando knocked on the apartment door.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.020]   When the door opened, I saw several people
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.020]   sleeping in the living room.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   Her name was Julia.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.020]   She had three boys and a sister in that apartment.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   She was a petite Spanish lady
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.020]   who opened up her home for homeless people.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.020]   As far as I could see,
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.020]   there were three homeless people sleeping there.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.020]   There might have been more.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.020]   The apartment had cockroaches everywhere.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.020]   After Julia finished praying,
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.020]   she came over to where we were and held our hands,
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:36.020]   and we read Scripture and prayed together.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.020]   After prayer, one of the homeless guys made coffee for us.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.020]   We sat there for about 30 to 40 minutes.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.020]   All that time, Angel gave me his testimony.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.020]   God seemed to be really working on him.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.020]   He has high motivation but low direction.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.020]   What can you possibly do as a homeless person?
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.020]   We left the apartment around 8 a.m. in the morning.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.020]   It was pouring even harder than earlier,
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.020]   but they walked right into it.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:03.020]   I wanted to ask them to wait until it stopped raining,
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.020]   but I also wanted to know their life as they lived it,
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.020]   so I kept silent.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.020]   I got soaking wet, especially my feet,
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.020]   as we walked close to one mile in rain
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.020]   to a Christian home that gave out food
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.020]   every Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.020]   Jorge decided to catch a bus to his friend's apartment.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:22.020]   They didn't even have 50 cents for bus fare.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.020]   Luckily, I had 50 cents in my notebook,
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.020]   which I was saving for the phone call I was going to make
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.020]   to get picked up on Thursday.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.020]   Next home we went to was packed with homeless people,
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.020]   maybe 50 or more.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.020]   It was sort of scary to be among these people at first,
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.020]   but it didn't take long for me to get used to it.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:41.020]   I felt like I was in a whole different world.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.020]   After staying there for three to four hours,
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.020]   we left to a nearby park.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:48.020]   We sat there for another three to four hours just waiting.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.020]   Waiting for what? I don't know.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:55.020]   The life of the homeless is just a lot of waiting.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:58.020]   The biggest problem is not food or shelter,
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.020]   but it is the feeling of hopelessness and emptiness.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:04.020]   Santa Ana Civic Center will not open up to the homeless
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.020]   until 6 p.m., so Angel, Fernando, and I
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.020]   began to just walk around Santa Ana.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.020]   I felt like a little kid again.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   I had time, I had no worries, no problems,
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.020]   no responsibilities, at least for that moment.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.020]   These two guys were no longer just homeless people
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.020]   that I hung around with.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.020]   They began to become true friends.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.020]   This made me happy and sad at the same time
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:26.020]   because I knew I had to go back
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:29.020]   and leave them behind a day later.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.020]   Fernando found $5, so he bought some bread
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.020]   and some beans to eat for dinner.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.020]   It was so cold, I was very hungry.
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:38.020]   Every little thing seemed to be sweeter
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.020]   when you don't have too much of it.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.020]   In the evening time, Fernando suggested
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:46.020]   that we go to a shelter provided by Salvation Army.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   They come around on those days when it is extra cold.
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   That day, it was very cold, around 7 p.m.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.020]   The bus came and everyone got on.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.020]   It was like a zoo.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.020]   Everyone was pushing and shoving to get in
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.020]   after entering the bus.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.020]   I realized that I was amongst a group of people
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.020]   that are familiar to a completely different life.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.020]   To them, fighting and cutting and killing
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.020]   are not that foreign.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.020]   It is something that they are exposed to constantly
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.020]   and I was right in the middle of these people on the bus.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.020]   I began to pray and it was the longest bus ride
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.020]   I have ever ridden.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.020]   I slept in a shelter with about 200 to 300
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.020]   other druggies, ex-convicts, alcoholics,
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.020]   and some who seemed perfectly normal.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.020]   Though this situation was not the most comfortable place,
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.020]   the place that I could be in,
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.020]   that night I slept like a log because I was so tired.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.020]   I'll just stop there.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.020]   Some of these things I completely forgot for years.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.020]   As I was reading, it brought back memories
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.020]   of the few people that I met, but a few things
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.020]   that I learned that I would not have understood
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.020]   if I wasn't there.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.020]   One, when we see homeless people,
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.020]   we typically think that the biggest problem
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.020]   is they don't have shelter, they must be cold,
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.020]   they need food.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.020]   During the short time that I was there,
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.020]   I realized that that was not an issue.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.020]   There are many saints out in that area
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.020]   who are more than willing to open up their homes,
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.020]   and if it gets cold, immediately blankets come out,
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.020]   and they know where to go to food
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.020]   from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, all the way to Sunday morning.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.020]   It's just a matter of them willing to go
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.020]   and walk a little bit to get there.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.020]   The biggest problem, what I saw,
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.020]   was a sense of insignificance and hopelessness.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.020]   When I asked them, "What's the hardest part
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.020]   "of being homeless?"
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:32.020]   I was expecting them saying, "It gets cold,
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:35.020]   "it's dark, it's not safe."
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.020]   What they said to me was,
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.020]   "Most people are pretty cordial.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.020]   "They're not rude to us.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.020]   "Every once in a while, they'll hand us things for free."
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:48.020]   But it says, "Most people don't like to make eye contact
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:51.020]   "because they know they don't want us there."
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.020]   Whether we are inside the restaurant
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.020]   or outside just resting,
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.020]   as soon as somebody walks by,
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.020]   you could tell in their eyes they just don't want us there.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:04.020]   And the feeling of insignificance and emptiness
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:09.020]   is the hardest part, he says.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:13.020]   I realized that shelter was not safe for most people.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.020]   In fact, that night, I slept with 200, 300 people.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:18.020]   I was sleeping right next to-- in the cots
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.020]   with somebody who was screaming in the middle of the night.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.020]   An alcoholic who was drunk was grabbed by my arms
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.020]   in the middle of the night, pulled him to himself.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020]   And I didn't feel safe.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:31.020]   I had to move my cot up to the stage where no one else was.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:33.020]   And I realized that if you were--
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.020]   if you didn't struggle with those things,
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.020]   that a shelter is the last place you'd want to be,
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.020]   that it'd almost feel safer to be outside.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.020]   And that's something that I would not have known
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.020]   if I wasn't there, even though it was just a few days.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:48.020]   But the biggest thing that I learned while I was out there
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.020]   was that the biggest problem of homelessness
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:54.020]   is no different than the biggest problem with all mankind.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.020]   It was not physical, it was spiritual.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.020]   Their homelessness was not simply because they didn't have a home.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.020]   They were not homeless people,
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:06.020]   they were people who just didn't have homes.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:11.020]   Their biggest problem was that they were spiritually lost.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:17.020]   Their wandering, I came back thinking,
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.020]   their need is no different than ours,
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:21.020]   that we don't solve their problem
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.020]   because we give them a warm place to stay,
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:27.020]   we don't solve their problem because we give them warm food to eat.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   Their problem is like all mankind, where death reigns.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.020]   They've experienced it at another level,
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:41.020]   but sometimes the deception is that because our bills are paid,
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:44.020]   because our children are sleeping in a warm house,
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:47.020]   that we think that we're better off.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.020]   The Bible says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:57.020]   The only true life can be had when we're reconciled with this God.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.020]   We are all separated from God,
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:04.020]   and in our separation are homeless and wandering
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.020]   from one stage of life to another looking for rest
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:13.020]   because that Sabbath that He brought us in at the creation was broken,
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:19.020]   and all of human history is striving, working, laboring, sacrificing
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.020]   to find that rest.
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:26.020]   And Jesus said, "Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden,
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.020]   and I will give you rest.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.020]   Take my work upon you and learn from me,
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   for I am gentle and humble in heart."
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.020]   That invitation still stands today.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:40.020]   Christ came and took on human flesh,
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.020]   emptied Himself of any glory and honor
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:45.020]   so that He can become a sympathetic high priest,
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.020]   so that we can draw near to Him,
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:53.020]   and so that we can come be reconciled to the only one that can give true life.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.020]   That is what we are celebrating today.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:01.020]   So as we sing, as we worship, as we fellowship,
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.020]   let's fix our eyes upon Christ.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.020]   Let's fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.020]   the author and the only perfect of our faith.
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.020]   Let's pray.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:20.020]   Heavenly Father,
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:24.020]   Lord, I know many of us have been churched
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   all our lives,
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.020]   or for many years,
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.020]   and we have gone through so many Christmases
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:35.020]   with our families, with our church.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.020]   And Lord, we wrestle
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:44.020]   that we do not spend this time of the year like the rest of the world.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:48.020]   I pray that the weight of what it is that we celebrate
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:52.020]   would sanctify us, challenge us, rebuke us, strengthen us,
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.020]   that we may worship You in spirit and in truth,
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:58.020]   that the rest of the world will know
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.020]   that God Himself came and took on human form,
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.020]   emptied Himself of all glory,
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.020]   that He may become a bondservant
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:10.020]   to reconcile us to You.
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:14.020]   And may glory, honor, praise, love, adoration, obedience
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.020]   belong to You and You alone.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.020]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.

[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.020]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.020]   the eternal love of God the Father,
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:48.020]   was sent his only begotten Son,
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.020]   who though in very form God,
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.020]   did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.020]   but he emptied himself,
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.020]   taking on the form of a bondservant,
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.020]   as a form of a man,
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:03.020]   even to the point of his humiliation on the cross.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:06.020]   I pray, Father, that as we celebrate this day,
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.020]   that the impact of what you've done
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:12.020]   would sanctify us,
