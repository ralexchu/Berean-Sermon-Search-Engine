[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Good morning.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.400]   My name is Eddie Kim and this is my testimony.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.080]   Growing up, there were many painful moments I faced in life.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.640]   I grew up in a single parent home since my birth mother abandoned my older brother, me,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   as a child.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.920]   Thanks to my aunt, I grew up in the local church during my childhood.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.160]   Church was nothing more than an activity I did twice a week with occasional retreats
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   and outings.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.280]   Whenever things grew tough in my life, I would go to the basketball court seeking refuge.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.920]   However, the storms grew stronger and basketball could no longer provide the comfort that I
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.360]   needed.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.520]   On a church retreat in eighth grade, I decided to go to the cross to lay my burdens down.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.240]   I felt an urge and need to tell God all my worries and pains I had experienced.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.320]   At that very moment, I dedicated my life to Christ, or at least that's what I told myself.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.880]   I went back to living life as if nothing had changed, but with a false perspective that
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.500]   God would surely bless me now that I dedicated my life to Him.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.060]   My relationship with God was surface level and shallow at best.
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.220]   My childhood continued to be unstable, and at times I had no place to call home.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.060]   As the years passed into my adulthood, my main priority was worldly riches so I could
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.200]   build a life and future that was much better than the childhood in hopes that my anxiety
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.460]   and fear would slowly fade.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.440]   When things started to look brighter, I would put God on the back burner and focus and prioritize
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.140]   my pursuit of success as my hope was placed in achieving the next goal.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.360]   I was blind and conditioned to believe that there was no one I could rely on but myself.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.060]   In order to be happy, I thought I had to take control of my future and be successful for
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.600]   a better tomorrow.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.500]   However, tomorrow always changed, and happiness was temporary.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.040]   My hope was falsely placed in man and this world.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.760]   I realize now, no matter how hard I tried, nothing was ever in my control, and success
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.920]   was just an illusion.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.280]   A distraction from the truth that my hope is in Christ alone, but was too prideful and
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.160]   stubborn to accept.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.940]   There were many storms from being bounced from home to home when my father was absent
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.100]   to him passing away from brain cancer, but nothing compelled into comparison to losing
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.200]   my brother who recently passed away.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.620]   The one person that was a constant figure throughout my entire life and whom I love
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.780]   so ever deeply.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.920]   At my breaking point, I was humbled before the Lord and he showed me that even in the
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.620]   challenges he has been with me every step of the way, I could feel God's love and
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.660]   presence and was overwhelmed with gratitude.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.640]   It was a familiar feeling I had experienced many times before, but chose to ignore.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.840]   How could this great God continue to love an unworthy sinner like me?
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.060]   I could no longer ignore God's calling and response.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.580]   I dedicated my life to Christ, but this time it was genuine.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.100]   To be clear, I am not saying that my life is now perfect without any pain, suffering,
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.420]   or sorrow.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.320]   What I am saying is that God revealed his goodness in each step of my journey.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.020]   I can clearly see and recognize that God's hands were in all things as nothing was in
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.060]   my control.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.500]   Through these challenges, God graciously and mercifully sanctified me to see that the storms
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.860]   will always come and go, but God's promise and hope are everlasting.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.860]   Prior to this realization, any challenges were reason to be angry with God, but now
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.020]   they are reason to praise God for all his goodness, even through the darkness.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.460]   While I am still processing my emotions and deep sorrow for my brother's passing, I
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.260]   find joy knowing there is hope in eternity through Christ.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.140]   I am getting baptized today to publicly profess my faith and submission of my life to Christ,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.940]   in obedience to his will, and dedicate myself to be anchored in him.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.940]   Thank you.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.940]   [applause]
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:28.940]   >> Thank you.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:52.940]   [applause]
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:12.940]   [applause]
