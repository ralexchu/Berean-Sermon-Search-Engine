[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 9, I'm going to be reading
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:15.360]   from verse 1 through 5. Romans chapter 9, verses 1 through 5. And I'm going to be focused
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.880]   on verses 1, 2, and 3. Reading out of the ESV. I am speaking the truth in Christ. I
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.480]   am not lying. My conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.440]   and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.040]   from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen, according to the flesh. They are
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.120]   Israelites and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.320]   law, the worship, and the promises. To them belong the patriarchs from their race according
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.360]   to the flesh is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen. Let's pray.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:08.320]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for calling us, for bringing us, and guiding us, Lord
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   God, to yourself. We thank you for your living word that continues to speak and reveal and
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.120]   sanctify. We pray that you would bless this morning, that your presence, Lord God, would
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.240]   be felt, that we would know that you are the head of this church, that all that we do may
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.480]   be surrendered for the sake of your name. I pray that the preaching of your word would
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.760]   go forth and would not return as you have promised until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.280]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Last week, our brother James did a great job presenting about
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.880]   India and I asked him to kind of give a summary about what happened. He has volunteered to
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.720]   kind of spearhead what we are doing in India. So he is going to be our point person next
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.840]   year and hopefully the other things that are going on. So he is going to be the guy as
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.960]   far as India is concerned. So I appreciate him sharing about that. I didn't really get
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.680]   to share much about it and I am not planning to do part two about our missions this morning.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.560]   But every time I go out, obviously it is physically exhausting. It was a pretty long trip. I think
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.840]   our flight and travel time was somewhere near 40 hours, about 38 hours or something like
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.080]   that and the 38 hours coming back. So every mission trip that we go, they usually take
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.440]   a picture of me knocked out somewhere. You know, whether in somebody's apartment or in
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.000]   the car and I think there was one in last week's slideshow. It is physically exhausting,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.200]   but it is also very rewarding. You feel refreshed. Not that we don't do missions here. Not that
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.080]   we don't do evangelism here. But that one week, that 8 to 10, 9 days that we are out,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.440]   it is intensified obviously. So every ounce of energy that we have is being spent doing
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.080]   God's work. So by the time we get into our room, we just pass out and we wake up and
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.640]   we start over again and then we come back. And I think the reason why, even though physically
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.720]   it is exhausting, we feel refreshed. I think everybody who has been out to missions will
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   testify to the same thing. That we feel refreshed because at the core of God's heart, this is
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.620]   where He is. Everything that we know of scripture is in the context of God pursuing sinners.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.260]   So when we say that we are followers of Christ, we are not saying that we adhere to certain
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.120]   doctrines. Of course that is part of it. When we say we are followers of Christ, we are
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.480]   not simply saying that we attend church or we serve the church. Of course that is part
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.420]   of it. But there is the most common sense application of when we say we are followers
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.040]   of Christ, we are following Him. That is what we mean by we say follow. So I am following
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.800]   you. It means wherever you are going, I am going. Whatever you are doing, I am doing.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.880]   That is what we mean when we say I am following him or I am following her. So when we say
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.680]   we are followers of Christ, it means that we are going where He is going. We are doing
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.360]   what He is doing. We are thinking what He is thinking. That is what it means to be a
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:18.120]   follower. If at the core of God's heart, if all that we know and everything that we are
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.960]   studying in scripture is in the context of this holy God pursuing sinners, to be a follower
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:32.280]   of Jesus Christ means that we follow His path of pursuing sinners. How He pursued us and
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.000]   as a result of us being pursued and being saved, now we follow Him to pursue other sinners.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.980]   That is what Jesus told His disciples when He said follow me, I will make you fishers
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.000]   of men. Because that is exactly why He came. To be fishers of men. And He trained them
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.640]   for three years to be fishers of men. And when He died, resurrected, and then He commissioned
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.880]   them to go, He said now go make fishers of men. Our whole purpose of why we are not in
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:10.060]   heaven yet and to call ourselves followers of Jesus Christ is to participate in this
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.520]   great commission. And if you want to have fellowship with Him, if you want to have intimacy
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.480]   and to be disconnected to this great commission, it means you are disconnected from the heart
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.040]   of God. In fact, all of scripture is written in that context. But if you really want to
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.240]   understand what Paul is saying in the book of Romans, you have to understand in the context
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.640]   of Paul pursuing sinners because that is what Christ commissioned him to do. The whole purpose
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.000]   of the book of Romans is introducing himself to the Christians in Rome, telling them this
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.720]   is the gospel that I have been preaching. That you have been hearing about. And he is
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.440]   hoping that he would come to Rome and maybe recruit some people to go with him to Spain.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   So if you see this just as a doctrinal statement, as just certain things that he is saying,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.480]   well he is just introducing himself, he is just going into detail. No. Obviously that
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.040]   is what he is doing, but it is in the context of recruiting other people to go preach the
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.680]   gospel. All of the New Testament is written in that context. So if we are not actively
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.880]   engaged in the Great Commission, the Bible eventually is going to begin to sound like
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:29.840]   IKEA furniture how to build manual. If you are not actually building a shelf, if you
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.040]   are not actually building furniture, reading that is going to be irrelevant to you. It
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.200]   is knowledge, it is nice to know where these screws go to, it is nice to know this. If
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.240]   somebody asks you, oh yeah you put the screws here, you put the building blocks here. But
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   it has no real application because application of what we are seeing in scripture is in the
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.920]   context of pursuing sinners. The reason why I say all of this is because what Paul is
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.000]   beginning to say in chapter 9 is directly related to what I have been saying. Chapter
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.200]   9 verse 1, 2 and 3 is not going to make a whole lot of sense to you. It is going to
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.000]   be, oh yeah Paul, he is really passionate about the Jews. He must have been a real nationalist.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.120]   He is a patriot. And that is why he was saying these extreme things. He is willing to give
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.040]   his life if it meant that he can save them. We can kind of gloss over that and read that
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.080]   and say, well you know Paul, he is not like us. God is not saying that this is how we
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.040]   ought to be. He is saying this is not possible. Of course, he may say that. Maybe he is even
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.840]   exaggerating. But we will never fully understand the heart of Paul, which is ultimately a reflection
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.080]   of the heart of our God, if we are not actively engaged in the Great Commission. Now, engaging
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.360]   the Great Commission does not mean you have to be overseas somewhere. It does not mean
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.240]   you have to go to India or China. Obviously, you can engage in the Great Commission here.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.000]   But a Christian life that is disengaged in the Great Commission is disengaged in the
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   heart of God. You are understanding church outside of the context of the larger picture
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.880]   of what Christ is trying to do. You are understanding fellowship and community outside of the context
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.760]   of what Christ is trying to do in the church. You are understanding the purpose of the church,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:31.200]   the use of finances, all outside of the heart of what Christ is trying to do. Great Commission
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:40.280]   is at the core, not only understanding these texts, but the heart of God. See, for three
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.160]   chapters in chapter 9, 10, and 11, Paul is going to expound in response to the eight
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:53.560]   chapters of the exposition of salvation by faith and by grace alone. But he is responding
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.000]   to these Jews who may have been thinking, "Well, if that's the case, where does that
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.280]   leave us?" You know, for the Jews, the law was not just a part of who they were. That
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.360]   was their identity that separated them from the world. So, if Paul, you're saying that
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:16.800]   the law doesn't distinguish us from the world, then who are we? What are you saying? So,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.480]   Paul's answering that question that the Jews naturally would have. For centuries, they
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.120]   believed that if they obeyed the law, that God's favor is going to be upon them. That
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.480]   their nation was going to be restored. That they have a special place in the Kingdom of
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.800]   God. That they're in a higher plane than the rest of the world. And all of a sudden, he
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.320]   says, "No, we're all, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." So, obviously,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.680]   we're going to be focused on these three verses today, but I want to just, again, help you
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:52.560]   understand 9, 10, and 11. Paul is really trying to answer two questions. One is that God is
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.440]   not done with Israel. That God's promises are faithful. That the Gospel is not Plan
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.480]   B. That He didn't start with Israel, and because they failed, now He's going to go to Plan
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.520]   B and He's going to be preaching the Gospel. He's basically reassuring the nation of Israel
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.840]   that what you've been learning all this point, you may have missed a point, but God's intention
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.280]   at all times was to continue the Gospel. And He's going to point that out. He's going to
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.680]   show the connection between the Old and the New Testament of the Gospel He's been preaching
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.160]   in the first eight chapters. But in the larger picture, and not just to the nation of Israel,
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.200]   He's going to be demonstrating His faithfulness to His promises, which is relevant to all
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.360]   of us. That what God said in the Old Testament, what God said in the New Testament, what God
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:49.120]   said to the Apostles 2,000 years ago, He is faithful. God is not man that he should lie,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.720]   nor the Son of Man that he should repent. He never changes His mind. What He says, you
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.360]   can bank on. And that's the second theme of chapter 9, 10, and 11. And so we'll get to
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:05.040]   that. We're going to go through these passages, but I just wanted you to see the larger theme
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.620]   of the three chapters that we're going to be covering. But today we're going to be looking
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:15.000]   at the first three verses. How does He introduce this? Well, if you look at it, again, read
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.320]   with me just the first verse. It almost seems like He's kind of disconnecting and starting
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.900]   something new. But in actuality, He's asking a question that He already knows that these
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.000]   Jews probably were asking, or maybe even grumbling in their hearts. If what you said in chapter
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.500]   1 through 8 is true, what about us? I am speaking the truth in Christ. I am not lying. My conscience
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.400]   bears me witness to the Holy Spirit. He hasn't said it yet, but in verse 1, He's basically
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.800]   setting them up and saying, what I'm going to say is true. What He's about to say must
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.280]   be really, really important. Usually if you have a conversation with somebody and you
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.380]   want them to really pay attention, there's some conversations we can have and they're
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.920]   kind of wandering off and you can talk. It's not that important. But if you really have
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.080]   something you need to say, right? If you're a parent and you need to give instructions
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.720]   to your child and he's just kind of wandering off, he said, no, pay attention. Right? I'm
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:22.800]   not messing around. Listen to me. Look me in the eye. What did I just say? Right? This
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.160]   is Paul's version of telling the readers, pay attention. Listen, look me in the eye.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.100]   What I'm about to say is true. I am not lying. He says it in the positive and then the negative.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.600]   He says, he's confirming that I am not lying in Christ. The Holy Spirit bears witness and
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.880]   he invokes the two heads of the Godhead to say, what I'm about to say is absolutely certain.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:56.700]   It's absolutely true. Now, why does he go about doing that? Because the easiest way
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:04.540]   to dismiss the gospel is to dismiss the messenger. Right? We do that in politics. If somebody
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.780]   has an opposing view of politics, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, our natural
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.580]   knee jerk reaction, the easiest thing to do is before engaging in what we disagree on,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:21.460]   we say, oh, he's an idiot. He's a racist. That's why he believes that. He's been raised
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.140]   this way. So we don't talk about this issue. If you nullify the speaker, then his message
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:33.340]   is nullified. We do that in politics and things that we disagree in. We do that oftentimes
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.220]   even in theological debates that we have. If you happen to go to that church, oh, if
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.140]   you go to that church, you must be like that. You must be ignorant. You don't know anything
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.820]   about the Bible. That's why you attend that church. You believe this. You're Calvinist?
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:57.140]   No, you must hate people. You're an Armenian? Did you read the Bible? So even in the Christian
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.780]   realm, if somebody has an opposing view, the easiest way to argue that is to dismiss the
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:10.580]   person. He's dumb. He's stupid. His personality is this way. We don't really need to talk
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:15.860]   about this issue. See, that's what Paul is dealing with. He preached the gospel and it
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:21.220]   was unsettling. He basically told them that everything that you thought about life was
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:29.580]   wrong. So the natural response is, this guy must hate the Jews. That's why he's saying
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.540]   what he's saying. Something must have happened to him. And I'll bet you there were conversations.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.380]   Maybe Gamaliel was about to flunk this guy. And maybe that's why. Maybe he was up for
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.420]   promotion and he was going to sit in the Sanhedrin and they voted him out. Something must have
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:50.780]   happened. Why is he doing that? See, in order to answer his critics, he first says, "I am
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.060]   not lying. I am speaking the truth in Christ. My conscience bears witness." And what is
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   he about to say? "I actually have sorrow and unceasing anguish. I don't rejoice of pointing
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:10.820]   out that the Jews will be condemned under the law if they continue to go down this path."
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:18.380]   See, our life, the way we live, it does matter. It does matter. You know why? Because the
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:26.420]   gospel that was given to us is a hostile message in this world. It is a light in darkness.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.500]   You ever have somebody that you just flip the light on, they're just sitting in darkness,
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.860]   they're watching a video or they're sleeping, you flip the light and they're like, "Ugh!"
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.380]   Immediate reaction is, "Ugh, turn it off!" See, when we preach the gospel, it's turning
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.180]   the light on in the darkness. So the first reaction that oftentimes we'll get is, "They'll
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:52.980]   nullify you. You bunch of hypocrites. You're not any different than me, judging me. You're
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:59.700]   thinking better than I am." See, that's why we are told in 1 Peter 2.12, "Keep your conduct
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:06.820]   among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:12.020]   may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation." What Peter is saying
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.100]   is when you preach the gospel, they're going to accuse you of being evil. Because they
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.380]   want to nullify the message. They don't like what they're hearing, so they're going to
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:27.220]   try to nitpick at where you are. And there's a reason why the scripture says the elder
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.380]   must be above reproach. Because you're going to be accused. The message that you're going
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:38.980]   to take to the world, they're going to accuse you of being a hater. And so if they have
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.940]   anything that they can trip you up on, it's going to nullify you, therefore nullify the
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.900]   message. So some of you guys may be thinking, "Well, that's why I don't want to be an elder."
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.580]   You know? See, that passage in 1 Peter 2 is not talking simply about elders. We may be
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:17:00.060]   an elder at this church, but you are an elder to the world. You may examine my life or the
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:06.100]   life of the leaders, but your life is being examined by the world. And if they find something
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:13.340]   to accuse you of that you are guilty, then automatically the message will be nullified.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.940]   That's why Paul is standing and saying, "What I'm saying, I say with a clear conscience.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:24.420]   It's not because I hate the Jews. In fact, I love them to the extent that I would even
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:32.980]   give my life." It matters the way we live. Years ago, in 2004, some of you guys may remember,
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:39.180]   there was a huge earthquake off the shores of India and between Indonesia, and over 230,000
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.920]   to 280,000 people died. So some of you guys may remember that. This earthquake was so
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.020]   damaging and this one particular area of the world got the brunt of it. There was a little
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.060]   city on the tip of Indonesia. Some of you guys may know about Indonesia, but the highest
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:02.860]   concentration of militant Muslims are in Indonesia. We don't hear much about that area because
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.140]   we get so much news about the Middle East. But we have friends who have been missionaries
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:13.260]   there for a while, and when all of that happened, I was having a conversation with him and he
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.220]   said that this little area, I mean Aceh, there's no Christian presence whatsoever. They're
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.220]   so violent against Christianity that there's no missionary that is ever allowed to be in
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:30.820]   the city. Well, when the tsunami hit, they were in the coastal city and they had about
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:38.420]   300,000 people, and out of 300,000, over 30,000 people got wiped out who lived near the shore.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.720]   So when this happened, obviously they had to open doors and outside relief began to
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:50.900]   come in. And the predominant presence of this relief came from Christians. And as a result
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.940]   of that, they said that the door got opened for the Gospel to be preached. And he was
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.980]   saying it was really exciting because for the first time, they were actually allowing
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.720]   Christians to come in. And he was telling me that one of the testimonies of the people,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.900]   the Muslims that were there, they were crying out, "Where are our Muslim brothers? Why
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:15.540]   are they not here? How come only the Christians are coming?" As a result of these good deeds,
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.700]   the Gospel began to get preached in this city. See, how we live matters because we are constantly
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.460]   going to be accused. Live in such a way that even though they want to accuse you, they
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:33.560]   can't because of your good deeds. See, Paul, this message of the cross was so offensive.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.900]   He was constantly being attacked. He was constantly trying, they were constantly trying to nullify
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.060]   his message by nullifying him. We typically think of opposition as being, rocks being
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.060]   thrown at them or them being dragged into jail. You know, all of that stuff obviously
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:56.060]   was difficult. But he was constantly being attacked by the Jews, by the Gentiles, and
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:02.480]   oftentimes even within the church. From the Jews, Romans 3.8, "And why not do evil that
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.780]   good may come as some people slanderously charge us with saying." Paul, if what you're
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:13.100]   saying is true, this guy just wants to live in debauchery. You know, live by faith and
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:19.560]   not by the law. And they were accusing him of preaching this Gospel because it was easier,
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:26.140]   because they want to live in licentiousness. In Philippians 3.2-6, these Judaizers were
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:31.100]   accusing Paul that this guy must hate the Jews. He must not have been a good Jew. Maybe
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:37.020]   he failed. He couldn't keep up with the law. And since he wasn't good at keeping the law,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.580]   maybe that's why he's saying the law is nullified. And he's choosing another path to get to God.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:48.420]   See, Paul is responding to that accusation in Philippians 3.2, "Look out for the dogs.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.780]   Look out for the evil doers. Look out for those who mutilate the flesh. For we are the
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.380]   real circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God in glory in Christ Jesus, and put no
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.860]   confidence in the flesh, though I myself have reason to put confidence in the flesh also."
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.660]   So in other words, he's saying, if you want to go toe to toe, if you think that I'm preaching
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:13.700]   this Gospel because somehow I failed in the flesh, let me tell you, though I myself have
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.220]   reason to confidence in the flesh also, if anyone thinks he has reason for confidence
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.660]   in the flesh, I have more. Circumcised on the eighth day. Of the apostles, of the people
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:28.780]   of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, right? Next to the tribe of Judah, the Benjamites were
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.660]   considered the most prestigious of all the tribes. I'm from tribe of Benjamin. A Hebrew
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.500]   among Hebrew. As to the law, a Pharisee. In other words, he took the law very seriously.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:44.900]   He wasn't just an average Jew. As to passion, to zeal, persecutor of the church. Now you
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:52.540]   guys already know that Paul took the responsibility for the first martyr of the church, Stephen.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.460]   And when he met Christ, it was in the context of him chasing after these Christians all
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.340]   the way to Damascus. Beating them, maybe even killing them. And you're going to accuse me
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.300]   of being weak. He says, well, if you want to go toe to toe, that's not the case at all.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:14.580]   As far as righteousness under the law, I was blameless. How many of you can say that? Paul
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.900]   is saying that because they were accusing him. They were trying to nullify this guy
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:24.260]   because they don't like the message that he had to preach. He was attacked by the Gentile.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.580]   They're trying to nullify him. And they were accusing him of being like one of these prophets
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.620]   that are coming in and saying this and stirring up people for his own profit, for his own
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:40.220]   glory. So if you remember in study of 1 Thessalonians, Paul writes this letter because people are
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.300]   beginning to nullify the message by saying Paul is coming for selfish reasons. He's like
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:49.660]   any of the all these other guys coming into town. All he wants really is your money. In
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.060]   response to that, 1 Thessalonians 2, 3, 6, "For our appeal does not spring from error
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.940]   or impurity or any attempt to deceive. But just as we have been approved by God to be
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.140]   entrusted with the gospel, so we speak not to please man, but to please God who trusts
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:11.620]   test our hearts. For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with pretext
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:17.500]   for greed. God is our witness. Nor do we seek glory from people, whether from you or from
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:23.180]   others, though we could have made demand as apostles of Christ." And he continues on.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.980]   If you continue to read that, basically Paul says, "I never asked for money." People are
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.460]   accusing us of coming and all we want is our own glory. All we want is money from you.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.260]   He says, "Remember when I was there." I know these people are saying this and they're trying
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:41.580]   to nullify the message by nullifying the messenger. "You remember how I was with you." It wasn't
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:49.020]   about money. It was not about glory. But I think most hurtful attack that Paul received
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:56.500]   was mostly from the church. And you see a heart-wrenching letter being written in 2
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.820]   Corinthians. 1 Corinthians is written to rebuke and to address specific issues because of
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.500]   their division in the church and allowing certain sin in the church. And they got a
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.700]   react—Paul got a reaction from that. Even though he spent all this time ministering
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.700]   to them, risking their life, their health, because they didn't like what Paul had to
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:22.500]   say. "Hey, this guy, maybe he's not an apostle." I mean, look at what Paul says for 2 Corinthians
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:28.820]   11.5. "I consider that I am not the least or inferior to super apostles." In other words,
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.700]   Paul, you don't cut it. You know, we don't like what you're saying, but maybe we don't
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:39.300]   even need to listen to you because you're not a true apostle. "Even if I am unskilled
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:46.020]   in speaking." You know why he says that? He's not simply just being honest. He's saying
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:52.740]   that because they're accusing him. He's not a good speaker. He's not an apostle. I like
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:59.500]   Apollos. I like Peter because he was the closest to Christ. Johnny come lately, you know, and
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.940]   then he falls off a horse and all of a sudden he's rebuking all of us. He's rebuking Peter
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.540]   in public. He's writing this letter saying that all the Judaizers are wrong. And then
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.940]   he's telling us that we're divided and we're allowing certain sins in our life and he's
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:18.180]   going to come with a whip. And then he asked for money. Who is this guy? He doesn't, I
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.340]   don't even like the way he speaks. See, he's saying that because he's defending himself.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:30.220]   Yeah, I know. I may be unskilled in speaking, but I am so, I am not so in knowledge. What
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.820]   I'm telling you is truth. Even though you want to nullify the message by nullifying
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:40.380]   the message in every way we have made this plain to you in all things that I commit sin
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.620]   and humbling myself so that you might be exalted because I preach God's gospel to you free
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.860]   of charge. In other words, these apostles are, that we're supporting, you know, they're,
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.380]   they were used to giving them money and say, are you disqualifying me because I didn't
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.980]   get money from you? I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:03.180]   serve you. And when I was with you and I was in need, I did not burden any of you for the
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:09.420]   brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. He's addressing issue by issue by
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:15.300]   issue because they're accusing him because they didn't like what he had to say. Second
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.580]   Corinthians 11 21. But whatever anyone else dares to boast of, I am speaking as a fool.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.300]   I also dare to boast of that. Are they Hebrew? So am I. Are they Israelite? So am I. Are
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.980]   they Austrians of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one. I am
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:37.020]   talking like a madman. I know what this sounds like to you, that it sounds like I'm boasting,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.100]   but it says, I'm saying all of this because I want you to pay attention to the message.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.540]   You're trying to nullify me because you don't like what I have to say. But if you, if you
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:55.880]   are accusing me, so he's defending himself. So next section, he lists out what he went
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.820]   through to get the gospel to these people. Five times I received the hands of the Jews,
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.340]   the 40 lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.700]   times I was shipwrecked. At night and the day I was, I was adrift at sea on freaking
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.940]   journeys in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from its own people, danger
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.640]   from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.580]   false brothers, in toil and hardship through many sleepless night, in hunger and thirst,
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:29.940]   and often without food and cold and exposure. I know that this is Paul's credential and
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:37.860]   we often quote this passage and say, well, Paul suffered quite a bit for the gospel.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.500]   But Paul is writing this to defend himself. He's writing this to defend himself because
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:51.020]   they're trying to nullify his message. They didn't like being rebuked. They didn't like
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:57.300]   being told of their divisiveness, of certain doctrines that they held. They didn't mind
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.860]   it when he was preaching about certain things that encouraged them, but when he came out
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:08.340]   hard in 1 Corinthians, and he says, apart from all of that, all the other things, there
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:14.180]   is a daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. Who is weak and I am not
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:21.660]   weak. Who is made to fall and I am not indignant. Paul already knows this in his head that the
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:27.500]   eight chapters of exposition of the gospel, when the gospel is preached clearly without
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   compromise, the whole counsel of God, only person who will thank you is the one who repents.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.220]   Only person that's going to say thank you for sharing the gospel is the one that repents.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.900]   If you preach the gospel correctly, without compromise, in season and out of season, everyone
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:53.940]   else will think you're a bigot. You're a liar. You're a hypocrite. You're arrogant. How can
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:00.700]   you say such a thing in this day and age? You're a homophobe. You're a misogynist. If
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.380]   the gospel is preached correctly, see Paul already knows this, that his message will
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.780]   not go over well if they don't receive it. And because they're going to nullify him to
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:19.100]   nullify the message, he says, I am not, what I'm telling you is truth. I am not lying.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:26.460]   My conscience bears witness in the Holy Spirit. And then he says what he needs them to hear
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:33.500]   and to believe before he moves on. He says, I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:44.400]   in my heart. You know, Paul was able to sympathize with them because he was the worst of them.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:50.340]   He knew how they would receive the gospel because that's how he received it. When Stephen
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.420]   and the early disciples began to preach the gospel, he was just as angry. He was willing
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:01.380]   to kill. So he knows how offensive this message is because now he's preaching the same gospel.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.820]   He was willing to kill. So he knows how offensive this is. He was able to sympathize with them
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:12.780]   because he was one of them. Not only was he one of them, he calls himself the chief of
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:18.580]   them. First Timothy 1, 15, 16, the saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:27.380]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost, the chief.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.620]   I don't think Paul is describing his current state of sin. You know, a lot of times people
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:39.100]   use this like, oh, I am the chief of sinners. No, I am. No, no, I am. You know, we're almost
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   like, you know, they call it humble bragging. You're bragging about your humility. I am
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:50.460]   the chief of sinners. Like Paul, I am so bad. No, no, no. You don't know how bad I am. It's
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.500]   not Paul is not humble bragging. I don't think because the very next passage he says, he
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:02.220]   is I am the foremost, but he's not, he's not saying this is who I am now. He said, but
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:08.900]   I receive mercy for this reason. He says, because I was the chief of sinners and he
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:16.660]   really was right. He said, we don't have to kill. I was a chief of these sinners. I understand
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.900]   you, but I receive mercy for this reason that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.860]   display his perfect patience as an example to those who are to believe in him for eternal
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:32.860]   life. The very reason why God chose him to be an apostle to the Gentiles is so that the
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:40.340]   gospel may be displayed, not him, that if that chief sinner can receive mercy and salvation,
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:48.300]   then so can we. So that the Jews may be able to hear the preaching of this man, this hateful
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:58.780]   man and say, wow, he can be saved. Then maybe I can be saved. Paul is not, even though he
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   may come off that way and some may, some people may accuse him of that. Paul say, no, I'm
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:11.180]   not preaching this gospel because I hate you. There's great anguish in my heart because
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.060]   you're rejecting the Messiah that we've been waiting for because you misunderstood.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:23.620]   So he's able to sympathize because he at one point was in his shoes, but he's able to sympathize
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:30.140]   because he was a recipient of this great mercy. Phil Riken says in his book, we respond to
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:37.420]   God's mercy by becoming merciful ourselves. The greatest evidence that we are, we are
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:42.260]   recipients of this mercy as we become merciful. It is an oxymoron for a, for a Christian to
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:48.340]   become proud. You know, every once in a while you may meet somebody who's memorizing scripture
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.700]   and discipline and doing all these things and they're filled with pride. And you say,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:59.300]   wow, they're really spiritual. The first evidence of somebody who was affected by the cross
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.940]   is humility because he's recognizing that he was dead in his trespasses and by the mercy
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.940]   of God, he was, he was yanked up from death. So how can somebody who was yanked up from
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:19.260]   death stand up and say, look at me. The first and true evidence of spiritual maturity is
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:26.700]   humility is brokenness. See, apostle Paul never forgot that he was the chief of sinners.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:33.540]   He never forgot that with all the credentials, with all that he has done, revelation coming
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:43.140]   through him, beaten and ultimately even killed. He never forgot that he was a chief of sinners
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:49.820]   that was saved from death. See, in the book of Luke chapter 15, you know about the parable
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.940]   of the prodigal son, but the context of that prodigal son starts in beginning of chapter
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.500]   15, where Jesus is associating with the tax collectors and the sinners. And the Pharisee
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.620]   comes and said, if you're a true rabbi, you should know that you shouldn't be hanging
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.140]   around with these sinners. And in response to the Pharisee's accusation, Jesus gives
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:14.540]   three parables. The first one is a parable of the lost sheep. 99, he leaves them and
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.380]   then goes, chases one. And the point of that parable is every single sheep is precious
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:24.420]   to God. The second parable is a parable of the lost coin. And the woman goes and sweeps
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.940]   the whole house, finds the coin and she rejoices. The point of that story is that every single
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:34.220]   coin is precious to the owner. And then he gives a third parable, which is the final
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.460]   punchline with a prodigal son who leaves and a father who anxiously waits when he comes
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.980]   home. He restores him fully, has a banquet, but then he ends with turning to the older
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:52.020]   brother, the Pharisee. And he rebukes him. And the point of the whole chapter 15 and
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.660]   point of every single one of these things, the punchline is, they accused Jesus, why
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:04.180]   do you hang out with sinners? And Jesus basically saying, why do you not? You do not know the
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.260]   heart of God. The reason why this bothers you is because you don't know who the father
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:18.940]   is. Paul is able to see and sympathize with them because he never forgot that he was one
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:25.540]   of them, that he was the prodigal son. He was the lost coin. He was the lost sheep.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:33.860]   But what he says in verse three, humanly, it's hard to understand, hard to relate to
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.740]   for I could wish that I myself were a curse and cut off from Christ for the sake of my
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:44.460]   brothers, my kinsmen, according to the flesh. You know, every once in a while, somebody,
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.300]   you know, you have a good friend or somebody in church or somebody at work and you become
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:55.220]   close to them and they'll say something like, dude, I'll take a bullet for you. Right? And
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.260]   they might mean it at that point. I think even Peter may have meant it when he said,
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:04.340]   you know, even if they all deny you, I'm not going to deny you. They may mean it, but if
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.740]   you live long enough, you know, you live long enough, you know, that human relationships
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:16.100]   are frail. That same guy who said, you know, I'll take a bullet for you. You know, all
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:23.020]   it takes is a misunderstanding and one argument and I'm going to kill you. Take a bullet.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.940]   I'm the one going to shoot you. Right? And that's how fragile human relationships are.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:36.020]   Is Paul exaggerating? He's not talking about his mom, his dad, his son. He's talking about
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:40.340]   his countrymen. So maybe we can look at that and say, oh, maybe we don't really realize
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.780]   the nationalism of the Jews. You know, maybe that's just the way they felt about each other.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:51.460]   I mean, I can understand that he has passion. Maybe he was a preacher and he probably was,
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:58.860]   but he's saying that if I could, I will be a cursed anathema. If I can trade places with
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:06.700]   you. I mean, it sounds good, but if he just said that out in the open, we could just,
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.820]   you know, that's a passionate guy. He's just, he's just a type A personality, but he just
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.660]   set this up by saying, I am not lying. I'm telling the truth in Christ. My conscience
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.500]   bears witness in the Holy Spirit. He just set it up by saying, God is my witness. What
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:29.980]   I'm about to tell you is absolute truth. So we have to accept this as truth. Paul meant
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:41.140]   this to humanly speaking, what he said makes no sense. See what Paul, what he's saying
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:49.940]   is if I could, if I was capable, if I was able, I would try to change places so that
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:57.420]   you can be saved. And the only reason why he's able to say that is because that's what
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:05.420]   he's been talking about for eight chapters. For eight chapters, he's been expounding what
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:14.620]   he wished that he could do. Our Lord Jesus did. He was accursed in their place. He was
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:20.180]   accursed for his, for his place. He wasn't, he's not just simply saying, I have this great
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:25.980]   love. He said, if I was able to do what I'm telling you, what Jesus did, I would, but
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:34.740]   I can't. And that's why I'm telling you about him because he did. So don't nullify the messenger
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:41.420]   because you don't love the message I want to tell you about this man. That's why 2 Corinthians
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:47.780]   5 14, it says for the love of Christ controls us. And some of your translations, it says
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:58.580]   it compels us. It wasn't a, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't a new year's resolution. It wasn't
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:05.540]   an accountability group. He was so deeply affected by the love of Christ in his life
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:13.420]   that God would send his only begotten son to take his place of judgment that he was
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:19.820]   compelled to go tell other people. He was compelled to preach it to the elect. He was
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.180]   compelled to be beaten. He was compelled to be prisoned. And he was eventually compelled
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:32.100]   to be beheaded because of the love of Christ. He is not lying. He's telling the truth. His
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:38.620]   conscious bears witness in the Holy spirit and he is confirming the message of the cross.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.420]   We are compelled by the love of Christ because we have concluded that this, that one has
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:48.260]   died for all, therefore all have died. And he died for all that those who live my no
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:55.500]   longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised years ago.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   I think it was a sophomore in college. The very first time we went street evangelism,
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.860]   I passed out tracks before, but never like actually talking to people. And our campus
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.900]   leader who I lived with for about a year and a half prior to that, we went up to evangelize
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.420]   up at big bear and we all came back. You know, those of you who've ever been street evangelism,
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.740]   I mean, it gets your blood boiling. I mean, you get pumped up. So we all came back, young
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.540]   college students, we're all sharing with each other, you know, and I got chased out of the
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.100]   store with the broom. I got persecuted, you know, we're all sharing these stories and
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.540]   we're all pumping each other up. And then our, our leader, our home leader came up and
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.760]   he started sharing and he said how he was having this conversation with this elderly
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.260]   couple and he said, well, they were so nice, you know, grandparents. And, and then they
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.300]   just, after he shared the gospel, they said, no, that's not for me, you know, and they
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.580]   were polite about it, but they rejected the gospel. And he was sharing this. And for a
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.980]   year and a half, I lived with them about a year prior to that day. I've never seen him
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.340]   shed a tear. I mean, this guy is like a ex military guy from Korea. You know, he would
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:02.020]   make us wake up at five o'clock. Even if you slept at three, you wake up at five and we
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.500]   go running. We do quiet time, memorize scripture. I mean, this guy ran it like a military. He
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.180]   stood up there and he was sharing about how this elderly couple rejected the gospel and
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:16.020]   it just kind of overwhelmed him. He was explaining what it, what the consequence of rejecting
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:22.220]   Christ. And he began to shed tears talking about this elderly couple that he just ran
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:27.500]   into for about an hour, talking about the consequence. If they do not turn from their
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:33.620]   sins, what will happen? And I remember as a young college student that made such a deep
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:43.500]   impression on me. So I don't know if I ever wept for a lost soul up to that point. And
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:51.820]   I remember praying that night, Lord, let me weep for souls like him. Let me weep for souls
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:42:01.740]   like him because this is his heart. John Knox, I'm going to end with this. John Knox, who
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:14.020]   brought the gospel to Ireland, his prayer often was give me Scotland or God or I die.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:22.340]   David Brainer was often quoted by Jonathan Edwards, a missionary to the native Indians.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:33.420]   His prayer was often now let me burn out for God. Our prayer should not be Lord, make me
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:42.220]   a better Christian, which is not a bad prayer. That I'm going to be more fit and all this
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:48.660]   stuff. There's nothing wrong with any of this stuff. But do we cry out for what God cries
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:43:02.100]   out for? Do we ache for the world that's dying every single day without the gospel? When
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:09.180]   was the last time you were on your knees, praying and interceding for the lost around
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:19.100]   you? Let the truth of the gospel sink in. Put away the things that are distracting.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:28.300]   Let the truth of the gospel really sink in and let the love of Christ compel us. Let's
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:36.220]   take a minute to come before the Lord in prayer and really pray that what Paul is saying about
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.700]   his countrymen, about the lost, is not just something that we hear, it's a passage in
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:46.300]   the Bible. To come before the Lord and pray that that would be our heart, that would be
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:53.620]   our prayer. That we would know the heart of the Father and ache and intercede and cry
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:59.340]   out for the lost. Let's take some time to pray as our worship leaders lead us.
