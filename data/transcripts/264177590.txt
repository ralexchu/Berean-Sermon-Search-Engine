[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 12, we're going to be reading from
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.800]   verse 17 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.800]   Romans chapter 12, verse 17 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.000]   We're continuing our series, our seventh series on qualities of biblical love.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.200]   Verse 17, reading out of the ESV, "Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.680]   what is honorable in the sight of all.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.240]   If possible, so far as depends on you, live peaceably with all.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.920]   Beloved, never avenge yourself, but leave it to the wrath of God.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.680]   For it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it as the Lord.'
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.780]   To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.000]   If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.280]   For by doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.920]   Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920]   Let's pray.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.960]   Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.280]   May your word go forth and not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.240]   We pray for soft hearts and open ears, Lord God, and a committed will to follow all that
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   you have given us.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   We entrust this time to you, Lord.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   Amen.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.120]   How do you measure maturity?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.840]   I think if we were to pose that question to different people in this church, or even outside
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080]   the church, you may get various answers.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.420]   So if you're in certain circles, they may answer that question by saying, "Well, true
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.040]   maturity are people who really care for the poor."
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.320]   And so based upon how much time and effort and money they give to the poor and serve
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.040]   for social justice, that's how we measure Christian maturity.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.180]   Some people may say about evangelism, that if we're making disciples and we're preaching
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.360]   the gospel to the lost, that that's the measure of maturity.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.280]   Some people will say that you can only measure maturity by how much scripture they know.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   Do they know the scripture?
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.860]   Can they dissect the word of God?
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.480]   How much theology or how much theological books have they read?
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.600]   Now we don't have to guess, even though there might be discussions as to how to come to
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.000]   this conclusion, we don't have to guess because Jesus made that very clear.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.020]   He said that the measure of a believer is his love.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.080]   The world distinguishes us and the non-Christian world with love.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.400]   He doesn't say theological accurateness, and all of these things are important things.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.640]   These are overflow of things that we ought to have.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.400]   But at the backbone of Christianity is love, and not just any kind of love, because the
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.960]   whole world practices love.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.560]   Even the worst of criminals, they practice some kind of love.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760]   He's not talking about any kind of love.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.380]   He said, "If you love as I have loved you, specifically agape love that we've been talking
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500]   about, that's the measure of maturity.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.260]   That's how you know if someone is truly a believer or not believer."
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.380]   In fact, one of my favorite books, if not the most favorite book that I've ever read,
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.940]   is the book from Jonathan Edwards called Religious Affections.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.300]   The context of that book is there was a great awakening that happened with his preaching
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.900]   and George Whitefield's preaching, and a revival was breaking out all over the United States.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.140]   It caused a lot of debate whether that was genuine or not, because even in Jonathan Edwards,
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.020]   a committed Presbyterian preacher who is known to be giving dry sermons with just heavy theologically
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.220]   based sermons, and people would break out into singing and praising, maybe sometimes
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.220]   even in convulsion.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.620]   There was a lot of people who were looking at that and saying, "That's not genuine."
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.780]   There was a debate going on whether this awakening was a true awakening from God, or was it just
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.700]   hysteria.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.180]   Jonathan Edwards writes this book, Religious Affections, to deal with that matter.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.980]   He begins the first half of the book identifying false affection.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.700]   In identifying that, he dissects like a surgeon that you can be at church and give a lot and
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.480]   have false affection.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.580]   You can read the scriptures and be theologically astute, all for the wrong reason.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.820]   He just goes down the list of everything that we can imagine what a good Christian should
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.860]   do, and he says all of that can be faked.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.160]   Then he begins to rebuild what a true Christian looks like, and at the backbone of his argument
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.380]   is affection.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.340]   You can tell if someone is a genuine believer in Christ, and if this revival is real, it
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.180]   will ultimately lead to true affection for the Lord, which will lead to theological astuteness,
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.980]   which will lead to serving the church, but at the backbone is this agape love?
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.500]   Is there evidence of this agape love?
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.220]   This morning when we're looking at verse 17 to 21, there's three things that we are told
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.900]   not to do in describing what this religious affection, this true affection for God looks
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.520]   like.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.760]   First one, we're taught not to repay evil for evil.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.440]   Not to repay evil for evil.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.240]   Our natural inclination is to retaliate, and it's not just some people, all of us.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.840]   I realized early on in my marriage with Esther that both of us have something in common,
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.240]   and that commonality was we loved movies with vengeance.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   We loved that.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.920]   You know what I mean, where somebody is oppressed, and you get bullied, and then at the end,
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.560]   they rise up, and then they overthrow these bad guys, right?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.920]   There's some satisfaction you get when coming out of those kind of movies.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.640]   I think that's why some of you guys may remember the Rocky movies, the series of Rocky movies.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.680]   Yeah, that movie.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   Maybe some of you guys watched it, didn't watch it, but that movie was always about
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.480]   the underdog who was oppressed.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.880]   They didn't get the fair chance, and they're going against a giant, whether it's a heavy
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.000]   champion or whether it's a Russian guy, and they're all mocking him because he has no
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.480]   chance, and then he gets beat up for half the round, and all of a sudden, he wakes up,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.360]   and he beats them.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   And basically, that's the premise behind every single movie, but every single movie, we know
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.680]   what's going to happen, but it's awesome.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.120]   At the end of the day, when the little guy beats up the big guy for bullying him.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:31.960]   Now that's our natural inclination, but for God to say, "When you are repaid evil, to
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   not to repay evil," it goes against our very instinct.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   There's a satisfaction of repaying somebody who did you wrong, but he says not to repay
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   for it.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   In fact, he goes even further than that.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.720]   He says, "But give thought and do what is honorable in the sight of all."
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.240]   Not only to not to repay, but to carefully consider.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.160]   In James chapter 120, it says, "Anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God."
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.040]   How often do we give full vent to our anger because we think that we have righteous indignation.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.960]   You are wrong, and I am right, so therefore, you deserve this.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.700]   So in James chapter 120, it says, "Our anger does not produce the righteousness of God."
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.200]   He goes even further than that in verse 18.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.240]   He says, "If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.280]   It's important that you recognize that verse when he says, "If possible," meaning that
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.000]   there may be certain situations that is beyond you, that you want to reconcile, but the other
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   person does not.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.920]   You are trying to do your best, but the other side does not reciprocate.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.000]   But when he says, "As far as it depends on you," he's not saying, "Do what you can, and
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.920]   if they don't respond, then give them your full vengeance.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.520]   You're free from this obligation."
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.320]   He's basically saying, "Do your part."
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.400]   You don't have to repay evil for evil.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.240]   Take time and don't react, and take some time to consider how to respond in an honorable
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.780]   way to live at peace with all.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.080]   That sounds like an impossible task, but there's a reason why he wants us to live this way
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.960]   and to practice this agape love.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.880]   The second prohibition is given to us in verse 19, where he says, "Do not avenge yourself.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.000]   Do not avenge yourself.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.760]   Leave room for the vengeance of God, for I will repay."
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.560]   Those of you who've known me for a long time, you know that I've told a lot of stories.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.360]   I've been giving sermons to some of you guys for 15 to 20 years, and you've heard every
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.400]   single story that I can possibly tell you.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.920]   Esther can literally repeat even before I say it.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.600]   She probably knows what I'm going to say already right now.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.000]   I used to tell a lot of stories about how I used to get into a lot of fights when I
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   was younger.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.440]   My parents moved around ridiculously.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   I actually counted.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.200]   I went to, I think, 11 or 12 different schools between kindergarten to 12th grade.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.600]   And then after we came to the United States, being a new kid in every single year of school,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   almost every single year, and then being Asian, I was in the East Coast, and then lived in
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.840]   the Midwest, and then went to the South, went back to Korea.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.400]   We moved around a lot.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.440]   So being the new kid, and then being Asian, a lot of times we were the only Asians.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.960]   Me and my brothers were the only Asians in that school.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.160]   And then on top of that being small in stature, you had three strikes.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.720]   So everywhere I went, the way I responded to that was by fighting.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.880]   That's the only way that I felt like I needed to survive.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.600]   And Esther knows, even to this day, I feel uncomfortable leaving the house with slippers
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.680]   on.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   And it's ridiculous.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.720]   I mean, this is like 30, 40 years removed.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.040]   And in my mind, I'm always thinking, what if something happens?
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   That's my thinking.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   So what if something happens?
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.040]   I need to be ready.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.720]   I need to have proper shoes on.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.200]   And so the reason why I stopped telling these fight stories is because I recognize how much
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.400]   I enjoy telling them.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:16.360]   And the reason behind it-- so I'm going to tell you one story today, OK?
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.200]   Because it fits the context.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.920]   So every single year, I would start out-- somebody would always start something, and
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.240]   then I would fight back, and then I would make bad friends.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   And then that's usually how it was until we moved to another school, start over.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.200]   I remember this one particular place that was even more than normal.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.440]   And it was in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.360]   It was fourth grade.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.720]   And we went there, and it's back down in the South.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.840]   There's no other Asians there.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.680]   And right off the bat, from the first day, that taunting, the racism, and just started
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   in your face.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.040]   Being a new kid, you try as hard as you can to kind of hold it in as much as you can.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.880]   But I remember this one kid who kind of was an outcast in that class.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.920]   He befriended me.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.120]   And I really appreciated his friendship, because he was the first one who came to me,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.940]   and we became good friends.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.920]   But I remember one day during-- I believe it was lunchtime-- I was walking out to see
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.840]   where he was, and I saw a group of kids, maybe about three kids, who was surrounding him,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.840]   pushing him around and bullying him.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.240]   And so obviously, he's a good friend of mine.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.880]   So I was starting to go over there to see what was going on.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.900]   And then as I got close, they pushed him to the ground.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.540]   So I snapped.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.360]   So I went over instinctively.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.080]   I went over there, and I pushed one guy.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.120]   I punched another guy, and I grabbed the other guy.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.480]   And fully thinking that I'm going to get jumped, too.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.680]   That I'm going to get jumped.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.280]   We're both going to get beat up.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.120]   But I think that they're watching a lot of kung fu movies.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.720]   Maybe Bruce Lee was really popular.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.540]   They got afraid.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.240]   So they backed off.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.800]   So I rescued my friend, and it felt good for a minute.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.920]   So me and him, we're walking back into class.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.720]   And then those three kids got the biggest friend that they had, and they decided to
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.060]   come and get me.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.600]   So we're walking back, and he's, oh, this is the kid who did this.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.140]   This is the kid.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.720]   And as I'm walking, a huge crowd started to form behind him.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.400]   And as I'm walking, he's, you dumb chink, what are you going to do now?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   What are you going to do now?
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.040]   So he's poking me at the back of the head, pushing me, poking me, taunting me.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.800]   I'm trying my best to hold it in.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.520]   And this is a big guy.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.080]   I didn't even think I could reach him if I was to swing.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.120]   So I'm trying to hold it in and hold it in, and he just pushed me too far.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.600]   And so as I was walking in, there was a step that I needed to take to get up to the classroom
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.480]   or to the building.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   And it was just enough.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.560]   And as I was stepping up, he poked me in the back of the head just one too many times.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.760]   And I just snapped, and I turned around, and I punched him as hard as I could.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.200]   And in my mind, again, I wasn't calculating.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.520]   I wasn't thinking.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.680]   I just like, he just pushed me too far.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.760]   And I hit him, and of course, behind him, the whole school's standing behind this big
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.440]   kid thinking like, I'm going to get killed today, right?
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:21.000]   But after I punched him, you could see in his eyes that there was fear.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.320]   So instead of punching me, there was like a dead silence.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.040]   As soon as I punched him, there was a, "Oh," like you're going to die, right?
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.480]   And then as soon as I punched him, he paused for a second, and he looked at me like, "Maybe
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.620]   this kid's crazy."
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.160]   And he just walked away.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.840]   That was one of my favorite memories of childhood.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:52.280]   I have a lot of stories, but that's my favorite.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.040]   I probably told that story to Esther at least once every month when we first met.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.920]   She's like, "Okay, you hit him, and he went, "Okay, we get it."
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:11.600]   So the reason why I share that story with you today is because it's very satisfying
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.280]   because he was clearly in the wrong, and it was a bully that got hit and embarrassed,
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   and he walked away.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.520]   Doesn't that make you feel good?
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.880]   That's why we watch vengeance movies, right?
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880]   Our very nature...
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.000]   Again, this is part of the reason why I stopped telling these stories is because I get too
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.640]   much satisfaction thinking about vengeance.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.360]   Our very nature requires we want justice.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   Even the perception that somebody wronged us, we want justice.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   And it is our very nature.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.840]   In fact, the world will celebrate it if you did it.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.240]   If somebody wronged you and you went and you took vengeance out on them, they would celebrate
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.200]   you.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.400]   So for God to tell us not to repay evil for evil and not to take vengeance goes against
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.600]   our very nature.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.520]   But the reason why he says you need to leave room for God's vengeance, there's four things
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.240]   that I want to share about why that's so important.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.760]   Number one, because God is the only one who can truly have right judgment.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.800]   1 Samuel 16.7, "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his appearance or on the height
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.640]   of his stature, because I have rejected him.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.240]   For the Lord sees not as man sees, but man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.040]   looks on the heart.'"
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.080]   You and I only have the ability to see what we see with our eyes.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.800]   We don't know what's happening before, we don't know what happened after, we don't know
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.480]   what that person is going through.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.520]   All we know is you did something in my view was wrong, and I'm going to take vengeance
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   out on that.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.800]   But God says we don't even have the ability to know who that man is.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.760]   He said, "Well, God looks at the heart."
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.560]   You and I don't have the ability, we don't have that omniscience to be able to know.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:01.120]   So how much of our vengeance and anger is a perception of what we think may have happened?
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.520]   Or even if it is the right thing, we don't know the context.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.040]   All we know is what we see.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.160]   Imagine if every single movie was just the trailer.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.360]   I mean, if you look at the trailer, every single trailer is a hit movie.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.600]   You know that's not true.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.240]   That's them presenting the best and trying to sell themselves to you.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   You know that's not true.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.800]   You have to wait until it comes out and you see the reviews and you know what it's really
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   like.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.880]   But you don't judge movies by the trailer, but that's the problem.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   You and I only have the ability to know the trailers of people, of circumstance, what
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.080]   we see on the outside.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.380]   So he says, first and foremost, we don't have the ability to make right judgment.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.280]   So he says, leave room for the vengeance of God.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.320]   How many times have you made a judgment and later on found out to be wrong?
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.000]   Maybe even righteous indignation, so angry, and then as time went by, a year went by,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.740]   two years, three years go by, and you realize you were wrong.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:04.520]   I tried to sit down and jot a list of things that I was wrong in my 50 years of life, and
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.540]   I wanted to share them with you, and I ran out of paper.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.680]   How often we have so many things that we just think that we're right, and then when you
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.640]   see the bigger picture, you realize that that wasn't the case.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.820]   So first, he says, to leave room for the vengeance of God, because only God is completely omniscient.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.600]   Only God can see the whole circumstance, past, present, and future.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.900]   Secondly, only God is righteous without fault, who is able to bring judgment.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.040]   Only God is righteous without fault, who is able to bring judgment.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   Even if what happened is clearly wrong.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.080]   The only way that you and I would have the right to take vengeance is if we are guiltless.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.960]   The scripture says in Matthew 7, 1-5, "Judge not that you not be judged."
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.360]   And I'm not going to read the whole passage, and you know that passage where it says, "How
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.520]   do you point out the toothpick out of someone else's eyes when you have a log in your own
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.980]   eye?"
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:05.980]   And everybody who is tainted by his own sin, everybody who is struggling with his own pride,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.360]   everybody who is easily offended when somebody says something that they don't want to hear,
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:16.660]   automatically is tainted in their vision of being able to determine right and wrong.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.120]   And he is in no position to judge.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:24.800]   So if you remember, in John 8, 1-11, there's a story of how these men bring this adulterous
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   woman and lay her before Jesus.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.120]   Basically they put him in a trap.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.280]   The Mosaic law basically says that this woman needs to be stoned.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.760]   The Roman law says that they don't have the right to bring capital punishment.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240]   So anything Jesus says would have trapped him.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   So it was a disingenuous question.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:52.200]   But Jesus, being God, looks straight through that, and he tells them, "He who has no sin,
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.520]   let him cast the first stone."
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.560]   He doesn't say, "You can't cast a stone.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.560]   She's not deserving of this."
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.560]   He doesn't say that.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.340]   He says, "Are you in a position to judge her?
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.900]   He who does not have any sin, you cast your first stone."
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.460]   And they turn around because they knew that he was right.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.900]   One, God is the only omniscient God.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.300]   Second one, he's the only pure and holy, holy, holy God who's able to judge, who's able to
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.180]   sit in the seat of judgment.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.860]   Thirdly, ultimately all sin and evil are rebellion against God.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:32.580]   That's why in Psalm 51, verse 4, where David says in repentance about adultery and about
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.900]   murder that he carries out against you, "And you only have I sinned and done what is evil
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:44.300]   in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment."
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.460]   He's not saying that he didn't sin against Bathsheba.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.680]   He's not saying that he didn't sin against Uriah.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.460]   He's saying in the grand scheme of things, every sin, every rebellion, every adultery,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.420]   every murder ultimately is a rebellion against the holy, holy, holy God.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.420]   And he recognizes that.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:04.340]   And that's why it says in Romans 5, 9, "Therefore we have now been justified by his blood.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:09.700]   Much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God."
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:16.220]   Our salvation ultimately is protection from his own wrath because he's the one who's offended.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.620]   He's the one we rebelled against.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.020]   He's the one who have every right to be angry.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.020]   He's the one, the scripture says, who has wrath waiting for us if we're not covered
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.260]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.960]   So ultimately, every sin is a rebellion against him.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:38.020]   And fourth and finally, leaving room for God's vengeance is evidence of true faith.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:45.100]   Only an individual who truly believes that a righteous judge will ultimately punish sin
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.540]   can leave room for his vengeance.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.180]   In Nahum 1, 2-3, it says, "The Lord is a jealous and avenging God.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.060]   The Lord is avenging and wrathful.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:58.540]   The Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries and keeps wrath for his enemies.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.660]   The Lord is slow to anger, great in power, and the Lord will by no means clear the guilty."
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.460]   If there's any vengeance or judgment that needs to be carried out, God will do it and
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.860]   he will do it perfectly without prejudice.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.020]   But the reason why he calls us to do that in verse 7, it says, "The Lord is good.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.740]   By stronghold in the day of trouble, he knows those who take refuge in him."
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.820]   Ultimately, leaving room for God's vengeance is taking refuge.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.500]   Not that we're like a doormat being stepped on, not that injustice is just going to go
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:39.140]   free, but if there is justice to be carried out, the one who knows all things, the one
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:45.420]   who is guiltless, the one who was ultimately offended, he will carry it out perfectly if
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.700]   that is the case.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.260]   And so we take refuge in him.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.220]   It is not saying, "Well, we're going to be a doormat and be stepped on."
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   He said, "No, we delay in it."
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:59.580]   He said, "If I made any kind of judgment that's wrong, leave it to him.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.420]   But if anything needs to be done, he will do it much better than we can do it."
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:13.460]   So the question we have to ask ourselves, do we seek vindication from man or from God?
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:18.100]   That question will answer for us if this is even possible, if this is even something that
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.940]   we would even entertain.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.460]   Do we seek vindication?
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.980]   Do we seek to be justified before men's eyes?
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.100]   Or are we ultimately seeking justification from him?
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:36.020]   Do we take refuge in him or do we give full vent to our anger when we think or feel that
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.580]   we've been wrong?
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.020]   But he goes even further than that.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.380]   He doesn't just say, "Don't do this."
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.100]   He goes even further and says, "To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.660]   If he is thirsty, give him something to drink."
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:54.940]   I mean, it's one thing to not to celebrate vengeance.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:00.780]   It's another thing to withhold your anger, but to go even a step further and he says,
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.480]   to feed him.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.100]   If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:12.020]   That passage that he's quoting is coming straight out of Proverbs 25, 21 through 22.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.140]   Solomon first says this.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.420]   He's not specific, at least in that context.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.020]   He's not talking about the gospel.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.580]   He's just talking about his observation in life.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.940]   He says, "There's no way to win your enemy.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.140]   The best way to win your enemy is to feed them and to, if they're thirsty, give them
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.140]   something to drink."
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.980]   Now, that sounds beautiful.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.060]   That's something that we would all look at and say, "Wow, that's something to celebrate."
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:46.380]   But to actually practice that, think about if you've ever been bullied or somebody took
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:54.580]   advantage of you, how often you fantasize about feeding him.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.180]   I was given that opportunity again.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.300]   I would just give him some drink.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.100]   Have you ever fantasized about that?
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.260]   I'll bet you, you stay up late at night.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.620]   Every once in a while, something will trigger.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.460]   It's like, "Man, if I went back there."
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.860]   You go to the gym and you're working out and your muscles are bulked up.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.980]   You look in, everybody's like, "Dude, you're yoked."
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.940]   You go home thinking like, "Man, I wish I was yoked in seventh grade."
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:26.020]   Because I remember that kid and thinking like, "If you give me another chance."
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.780]   How we fantasize about taking vengeance out on people who have wronged us, but to take
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:39.580]   us this far, not only to not to take it out on them, but to consider to feed them.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.580]   If we don't have any power to do it, it's frustrating.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.820]   It's like telling a kid who's maybe five feet three, "If you want to play in the basketball
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.620]   team, you have to dunk this ball."
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.540]   He's in the gym every day, trying hard and jumping up and down.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.140]   He was about two feet away.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.060]   Now he's 23 inches away.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:04.620]   The hardest he's worked and he's building up his calf muscles and he comes no closer
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.380]   than maybe another inch or two inches.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:14.660]   It's a cruel, cruel joke to think that we're called to pride.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.940]   Who does this?
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.260]   Who even thinks about this?
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.980]   Who even considers when somebody is wrong to go home and think like, "I got to do good
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.780]   to this person."
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.660]   We don't.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.900]   And the reason why he calls us to do this, he says in verse 20, he says, "For by so doing,
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.700]   you will keep burning coals on his head."
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.460]   You may look at that and say, "Well, it sounds like, well, take some coal, shove it up his
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.020]   head and throw it down and give it to him."
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.420]   It's like, obviously that's not what it's saying.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.940]   It doesn't fit the context.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.980]   He said to be merciful, feed, to be gracious, and then he says, "And then burn coals on
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.980]   his head."
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980]   Right?
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.940]   So obviously that's not the meaning of this text.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.260]   It's a very cultural word.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.420]   It's an idiom of that time, an Egyptian idiom.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.500]   Basically it's to demonstrate public contrition.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.460]   So an individual who a public sign of repentance would carry on his head a plate of burning
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.860]   coals to represent that he has been shamed and he is repenting.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.940]   So in other words, what Paul is saying is when your enemy comes to attack, show him
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:29.020]   kindness in reverse and shocking him to repentance.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.100]   That's basically what he means.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:37.840]   And the reason why he is doing this ultimately is not so that you can be a good person, although
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:44.360]   obviously this would be a very virtuous person, but ultimately he's showing us a way to win
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.440]   the world.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.380]   Because the natural instinct in our flesh is eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.260]   And you guys know that law, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth in the Old Testament is
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.620]   given in the context of civil law.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.780]   He's trying to restrain people from going too far.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:10.500]   If you know the laws of the cities of refuge, the cities of refuge, God creates six cities
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.860]   scattered all throughout Israel, and they're on the top of the mountains, on the hills,
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.700]   and all the best roads in Israel all led to the cities of refuge.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.580]   And ultimately, obviously, it points to Christ.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:28.660]   But the reason why the cities of refuge was created is in case an Israelite kills somebody
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:35.500]   by accident, a deliberate murder would not be allowed into the city.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.260]   Only somebody who commits a murder by accident, maybe working, you're swinging an axe and
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:47.500]   you hit somebody, and that person, assuming his family members are going to take vengeance
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:53.660]   on that person, to protect somebody who killed by accident, to run to the cities of refuge,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:59.040]   and all these cities were protected by the high priest, ultimately pointing to Christ.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.460]   So we come to the New Testament, and obviously it clearly points to Christ being our refuge,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.980]   the high priest, where we take our comfort and refuge from.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:13.660]   But all of this law was given because there was an innate understanding that even by accident,
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.000]   people are going to take vengeance on that person.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.620]   Because that is our fleshly nature, that is our natural nature, this is what the world
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.620]   practices.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.680]   They practice love when somebody deserves it, and they practice vengeance when they
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.900]   are wronged.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:36.300]   But Christ comes and breaks into this darkness, and he does something completely the opposite.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.520]   And even the Jews could not comprehend it.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.840]   When Jesus kept on telling his disciples he's going to the cross to die for sins, even they
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.780]   couldn't comprehend it.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.660]   Because they could understand a Messiah who would go and take vengeance upon the Romans,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:58.220]   upon these pagans, upon these tax collectors, upon these adulterers, who are ruining families.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:04.940]   But for him to give himself to feed them, to give them water to drink, that's what he
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:10.580]   means in the third and final one, it says not to be overcome by evil, but overcome evil
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.860]   with good.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:20.700]   Every single one of us, even in this room, are overcome by something.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.420]   You're overcome by fear that if you don't have enough money you won't be able to take
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.340]   care of your family.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.380]   You're overcome by temptation of the things that you've seen around us, and your thoughts
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.940]   and your heart is down that.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.860]   You're overcome by some sort of a hope that if you keep doing this, that you're going
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.380]   to keep going down this path.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.820]   All of us are overcome by something.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.260]   But when it comes to evil, he says do not be overcome by it.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:52.900]   The theologians, or even a common debate that we have is, which emotion is stronger, hatred
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.500]   or love?
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.620]   Theoretically, we're Christians so we'll say love.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.820]   But in practice, is it?
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:07.780]   And let me give you a scenario, just so that we can kind of deal with it realistically.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.860]   Let's say if somebody wronged you, and wronged you really bad.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.400]   And I'm not even going to give you the context because I believe that most of you can think
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.780]   of a context where you've been wronged.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.700]   You or a family member or something.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:27.340]   And you get this one opportunity to make it right.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.180]   Only one opportunity.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.900]   And God's not going to judge you, he's going to look the other way.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.820]   Hypothetically, hypothetically.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.980]   You got this one opportunity to take out your anger upon it and show him what's up.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.340]   And you've been dreaming about, fantasizing about this.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.340]   You got this one opportunity.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:49.820]   And then on the other hand, at the exact same time, you have this person that you love and
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.300]   you can go on a date with that person.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.620]   But it's only one time.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.340]   Which would you choose?
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.020]   I know the answer you're going to give to your Christian friends.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.500]   Of course love.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.740]   But in reality, you know what it feels like to have this anger burning inside of you.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:16.420]   You know what it's like to want vengeance taken out on somebody who's wronged you and
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.260]   hurt you so deeply.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.420]   The answer to that question of which emotion is stronger, hatred or love, really depends
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.380]   on what you have been overcome by.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:34.340]   What is overcoming your thoughts, your heart, your life, your fantasy?
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:42.580]   Do you dream about taking out justice against people who have wronged you?
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:51.140]   In 1 Peter 2, 20-24, it describes this agape love that you and I don't see in this world.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.180]   In fact, it's even rarely seen even in the church.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:00.340]   1 Peter 2, 20-24 says, "For what credit is it if when you sin and are beaten for it,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:06.180]   you endure, but if when you do good and suffer for it, you endure?
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.300]   This is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.340]   For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.900]   an example so that you might follow in his steps.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.620]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.080]   When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.580]   When he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.580]   justly.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:32.380]   He himself bore our sins in his body and on the tree, that we might die to sin and live
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.380]   to righteousness.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.860]   By his wounds you have been healed."
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:43.860]   See, the gospel message, sometimes we hear it, repeat it so often that we just assume
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.860]   certain things.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:50.060]   God loves us, we are sinners and he died for us, but think about the core of the gospel
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.060]   message.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.740]   There is nothing like it in this world.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.980]   In fact, that virtue isn't even understood.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.540]   Why would he do that?
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:09.260]   Why would a holy God empty himself and come and take the punishment, not for his future
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.140]   children but for enemies?
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.260]   Christ breaks into this dark world with the very thing that he commands us.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:21.700]   He says, "You are going to be characterized by the love that I practiced with you.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.260]   While you were yet sinners, I came and pursued you.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.260]   While you were blaspheming my name, I fed you.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.100]   While you were cursing and rebelling against me, I gave you water to drink."
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.060]   And that's why he tells us, "You want to come follow me, you need to pick up your cross
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.480]   and follow me as well."
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.940]   You can do Bible study in the flesh.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.100]   Because if you do a lot of Bible study, you get a lot of attention in the church.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.500]   You can even give to the poor in the flesh.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.740]   You say, "I'm a generous person, I'm just that type of a person.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.980]   I'm very virtuous and generous."
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.420]   You can lead and do what I'm doing up on the pulpit in the flesh.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.940]   Just like you want in the world and in the church, you use the pulpit to disseminate
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.740]   and get attention from people.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.940]   All of these things can be done in the flesh.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:18.900]   But you cannot practice agape love in the flesh.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:24.380]   You can't force yourself to love your enemy in the flesh.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.660]   Until you are compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:34.860]   When injustice comes into your life, or seemingly injustice, or even a miscommunication and
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:40.820]   a misunderstanding, it's all it takes to compel us to bring justice.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.100]   That's the world that we live in.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.060]   That's how it functions in our world.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.180]   That's how it functions in politics.
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.900]   That's how it functions in the business world.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.740]   It is in this world Jesus breaks in.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:58.960]   That's why Apostle Paul, he's writing the letter to the Corinthians, who he sacrificed
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.220]   possibly his life to come in there and preach the gospel.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:07.460]   People basically were telling him to shut up.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.980]   They didn't like what he had to say.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.300]   He's calling out their sin.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.780]   You guys are divided and you guys are acting fleshly and you're allowing all kinds of sin
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.620]   into your church.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.620]   How can you let this be?
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.580]   Shall I come to you with a whip or in love and in gentleness?
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.700]   And they didn't want to hear it.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.340]   So basically they said, maybe that guy's not an apostle.
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.620]   Basically they were telling him to shut up.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.060]   Your word sounds strong, but your appearance is weak.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.940]   Shut up.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:44.580]   In that context, our natural instinct is, Paul, shake off your dust, go somewhere else.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.780]   They don't deserve you.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.780]   You're risking your life.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:52.060]   You're being beaten and you're going in there to share the gospel with these people just
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.540]   so that they can be saved.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.420]   And eventually you're going to be beheaded to get the gospel to people like them.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.420]   Why?
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.380]   Shake off the dust and move on.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:08.100]   And it is in that context and it is in that letter to that church where he says, the love
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.020]   of Christ compels me.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.980]   That's not something he mustered up in himself.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.700]   It's not something because he was more virtuous than the next guy.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.140]   It wasn't because it was a logical move.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.060]   It wasn't because he calculated.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.980]   He just simply said, I do what I do because the love of Christ compels me.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:32.260]   A Christian cannot live his Christian life until the love of Christ is compelling him
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.420]   because at some point in your walk with God, something is going to happen to you.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.580]   Whether true or not true, something is going to happen to you to trip you up.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.540]   And then you're going to say, this is not worth it.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:56.300]   Only way that we can persevere is if we are compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:03.060]   The love of Christ grips your heart, grips your mind, and grips your life in such a way
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:11.060]   that even when hardships, even when injustice comes into your life, you look to Christ and
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.620]   you remember what he did for you.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.180]   That you were that enemy.
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.980]   That you were the one who was hungry.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.220]   That you were the one who was thirsty.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:27.740]   And you came to him in need and he forgave you and made you his only son.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.980]   Co-heirs with his only son.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:37.460]   It is only then we can persevere in our faith.
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.220]   That's why we can talk about Bible study and discipline and discipleship and we can do
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.980]   all of that, but all of that can be easily done in the flesh.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:52.060]   And that's why Jesus says, "They shall know you by this love.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:59.300]   If you have love for one another as I have loved you, then they will know."
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.220]   This morning I want to show you a video before I finish.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.340]   Let me set up here.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.820]   A lot of you guys probably saw this because I put this on Facebook a couple years ago.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.980]   And let me give you a context of this video before we start it.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:21.020]   A few years ago, during Palm Sunday, a bunch of terrorists tried to break into this Egyptian
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:29.860]   church and the lady who was being interviewed is an Egyptian Christian whose husband was
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.580]   blown up because he was guarding the door.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.940]   And in order to prevent the terrorists coming in, he grabbed him and then he blew himself
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.460]   up so he saved the church but he died.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:44.660]   And so obviously in Egypt, the majority are Muslim and there's a Muslim newscaster with
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:50.100]   a Muslim, what do you call it, a television announcer, news somebody.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.980]   Anyway, so she was there interviewing her and that's the context about what happened
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.380]   to her and trying to get the news.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.540]   So let's just watch this real quick.
