[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.360]   [ Background Conversations ]
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.200]   >> All right.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.860]   I'm going to give you guys 30 more seconds to wrap it up.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:58.840]   [ Background Conversations ]
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:29.480]   [ Background Conversations ]
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.520]   All right.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.980]   Let's -- let me pray and then we'll get into a short time
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.240]   of teaching and interacting together, okay?
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.920]   Let me pray.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.840]   Father, we are very thankful
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.440]   that you've given us just the opportunity to share and glean.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.700]   And we pray that as we focus on this meaty passage,
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.760]   I pray that you would teach us how to see things the way you
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.440]   see things, not to jump to conclusions,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.200]   not to base our interpretation on our experience
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.340]   or our opinions or preferences,
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.820]   but that we really would learn how
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.640]   to do church the way you would see fit.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.120]   So teach us.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.100]   Would you use the next 15, 20 minutes just to encourage
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.860]   and feed your people?
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.840]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.220]   Amen. So when I look at a passage, I usually --
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.440]   first thing I do to prepare to teach is to kind of organize it
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.780]   in a way that visually I can kind of see
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.920]   where the thought is going, okay?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.000]   And if you look at the farther --
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.920]   I mean the introduction is the introduction, okay?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.800]   I'm going to start with verse 5.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.840]   So for this reason, okay, and it's important
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.380]   to understand what that reason was.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.760]   And I've shared last week and in the sermon a couple weeks before
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.280]   that the for this reason really is the premise of eternal --
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.340]   the promise of eternal life.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.500]   And that's what's being pushed forward here.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.600]   That's the premise.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.940]   So for that reason, Titus is left in Crete, okay?
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.480]   And then there are two things that he needs to do.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.400]   Set in order, appoint elders, okay?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.760]   And here are the qualifications of church leaders.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.860]   I'll just call it that, okay?
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.100]   Church leaders kind of broken up into little two snippets
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.660]   of what that means.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.160]   We only looked at the first part.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.200]   Next week we're looking at --
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.220]   or next week we're looking at the second part.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.520]   And I'm going to read from verse 5 down, okay?
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.100]   For this reason I left you in Crete that you would set
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.300]   in order what remains and appoint elders
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.020]   in every city as I directed you.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.380]   Namely, if any man is above approach,
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.460]   the husband of one wife, having children who believe,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.620]   not accused of dissipation or rebellion.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.260]   And that's the part you guys studied today.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.520]   For the overseer must be above approach as God's steward.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.840]   Not self-willed, not quick-tempered,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.580]   not addicted to wine, not pugnacious,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.800]   not fond of sordid gain.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.980]   But -- and when I put that but in the middle there,
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.280]   it switches like my brain a little bit to kind of go, okay,
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.700]   now these are more positive things.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.440]   Hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.900]   devout, self-controlled.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.180]   Holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.420]   with the teaching so that he will be able both to exhort
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.080]   in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.700]   And if you notice, I pulled -- and this is my preference,
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.520]   my opinion, my educated assumption is that that so
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.000]   that it's not just holding fast the faithful word.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.180]   It's all of these things that make this man.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.780]   So that all of these things will help him, one, be offensive
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.540]   in teaching what is right, and then also like to be defensive
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.900]   when there are accusations made that he can stand up to them.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.860]   So he could lead the way God would have him lead, all right?
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.240]   So this whole list of stuff is to enable this --
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.500]   these men to lead well, okay?
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.680]   So I visually put that together like that so my mind kind
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.520]   of remembers not to get lost in the woods and just kind
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   of see what the thought flow is.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.920]   And then I look at it like this, okay?
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.500]   What we looked at today is more private life, all right?
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.740]   And then what we're going to look
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.380]   at in a couple weeks is public life.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.780]   Now, the thing is, Titus has a very important task here.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.220]   He has to go into Crete where he's not from, presumably,
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.420]   and he's got the job of appointing a bunch of elders
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.160]   and a bunch of churches in a limited period of time.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.380]   But how is he supposed to know who's men of character?
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.880]   That's actually a pretty hard task, right?
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.480]   Because character is observed over time.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.360]   And so what he's called to do is appoint people based
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.120]   on reputation, presumably,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.300]   whose private lives match their public presentation.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.560]   So public presentation is easy in the sense of like,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.580]   I can perform in front of you and make myself,
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.040]   to the best of my ability, a good pastor.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.060]   But my wife and my kids actually,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.400]   they know what's really in my heart.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.940]   They really know my character.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.100]   So it's really difficult to judge someone's private life.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.420]   One way that you can judge someone's private life is their
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.320]   wife and their kids, okay?
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.080]   So again, the purpose of this is the hope
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.180]   of eternal life has come.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.540]   You need to get the message out.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.900]   You need to set up people who won't get in the way,
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.160]   who can teach and defend, and these are the kinds
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.900]   of men that you need.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.860]   All right?
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.700]   So their private and their public life has
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.180]   to be consistent, and that's something that it's important
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.240]   for you guys to kind of remember so that when we get
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.160]   into like a verse six, you're like, oh, but children.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.280]   What if he has like five kids?
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.720]   Four of them are believers.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.940]   What if he's divorced 40 years ago and now he's remarried?
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.580]   Like, how many of you guys had those kinds of questions?
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.420]   Probably everybody, okay?
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.420]   Ooh, celebrity pastor, that guy,
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.520]   I heard his kid walked away from the faith.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.660]   Maybe he needs to step down.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.380]   Like, there's all of these thoughts that run
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.000]   through your mind, and I'm assuming it's
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.700]   across the board, okay?
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.540]   In order not to get lost in the woods, it's also helpful
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.620]   to remember that private and public life need
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.360]   to be consistent is the main thrust, okay?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.800]   And so that -- oh, this is weird.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.420]   Why is this one -- they're presenting different things.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.840]   All right, anyway.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.300]   My animations are -- oh, the animations, okay?
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.040]   So remember, the backdrop is there are presumably tribal
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.400]   city leaders already in these areas because he's got
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.820]   to basically do a pioneering mission work in some sense.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.080]   There's Christians everywhere.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   Nothing's organized.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.140]   And there are people probably already
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.280]   in the churches who are saying stuff.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.140]   They profess to know God, but by their deeds deny him.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.940]   Titus, you set up men who are not like this,
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.280]   who not only teach right, they live right,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.200]   both at home and in public.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.800]   So this is not just an act.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.900]   It's an outflow of Christian character.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.960]   So that's the -- when I look at the whole of this,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.060]   these are the things that, like, kind of make the framework
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.480]   for me as I go into each nitty-gritty detail
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.200]   of the verses.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.480]   And I'm not going to go over verse four and five.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.600]   I'm going to focus mostly on verse six
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.420]   because I'm assuming that's where the interest is, okay?
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.720]   And so what I do is I just come
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.700]   up with five different translations.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.820]   And I'll look at it in the English first.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.800]   And then I'll come up with as many questions as I can.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.440]   All right?
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.560]   And those are -- these are all my questions.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.520]   And I put extra because this was what's being presented.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.820]   All right?
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.400]   Here, I'll read it.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.880]   Is this the beginning of a new sentence in the Greek
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.480]   or a continuation built on a previous thought?
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.920]   And I'm assuming you guys probably got most of these.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.200]   Okay? Is man specific to male or is this general?
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   So like a complementarianism, egalitarianism kind of debate.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.080]   Could this talk about that at all?
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.200]   How much sin or imperfections
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.720]   or character flaw would still qualify as above approach?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.100]   Is husband of one wife referring simply to monogamy or more
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.620]   to marital fidelity, as NIV would suggest?
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.580]   If someone divorces or remarries,
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.720]   would that permanently disqualify him from ministry?
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.880]   How old should an elder's children be before we can gauge
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.200]   whether or not they are believers?
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.900]   What if the elder is either young or without children?
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.640]   What is the length of time elders are
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.560]   to be held accountable for the behavior of their children?
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.240]   Does having an adult unbelieving child disqualify a person
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:23.920]   from eldership?
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.500]   Is the accused of dissipation or rebellion more
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.600]   for the elder's children or only the elder?
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.080]   Because NASB, if you're reading the NASB, it just seems
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.840]   like another couple words on the list.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.140]   How many of you guys notice that?
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.320]   Okay. Is it okay if the child is unbelieving as long
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.680]   as he is not morally behaviorally out of control?
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.460]   At least he just behaved.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.280]   Is that okay?
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.180]   Is this based more on fact or reputation?
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.240]   Because it's an accusation, right?
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.680]   Is there a deeper meaning in the word dissipation
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.840]   as the translations all differ some?
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.840]   Okay. So these are just some questions.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.480]   If you had to -- if you told me to give 10 more,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.420]   I probably could.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.320]   But these are generally the questions
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.580]   that you guys all probably got.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.900]   Now, I'm going to be talking about three things today, okay?
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.560]   So namely, if any man is above reproach.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.140]   So the above reproach, what is that?
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.940]   Does it mean perfect?
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.100]   Okay. Then all of the pastors
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.420]   and the elders here would be disqualified.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.020]   But just anyway, above reproach.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.700]   The second thing we're going to look
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.300]   at together is what does it mean to be a husband of one wife?
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.560]   Okay. And then the third one is about the children.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.060]   All right.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.120]   And I'm assuming this is
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.620]   where you guys had the most lively discussions.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.900]   And on this note, I wanted to share with you --
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:46.360]   can you guys click the slides?
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:52.840]   Okay. So what we want is exegesis, okay?
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.620]   So when we're looking at these passages,
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.300]   we're trying to have exegesis, which is the process of drawing
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.220]   out the meaning from scripture in accordance with the context
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.040]   and discoveral meaning of its author.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.800]   We want to apply what Paul meant.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.260]   Make sense?
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.600]   Paul's dead.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.460]   This was written many years ago.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.940]   So we want to get as close to the application
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.540]   that Paul wanted us to make.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.600]   And through that, the process is we dive in
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.780]   and we try to take out whatever is in there, okay?
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.300]   Exegesis, on the other hand, which is not good,
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:43.940]   it's the process by which the reader imposes or injects his
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.920]   or her interpretation into the text.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.660]   We don't want to do that, okay?
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.440]   And it's very easy to do.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.760]   That's the default setting.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.700]   I'm going to read the passage through my eyes and the lens --
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.220]   I want to take my cultural goggles and interpret it
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.120]   and scrutinize it the way I want to, and that's incorrect.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.400]   So what we want to do through inductive study is land
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.060]   on neither legalism or liberalism.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.720]   Neither like Bible thumping, this is what the Bible says
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.840]   to the letter, so we need
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.660]   to carefully follow it all the way to the T, okay?
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.700]   You can go wrong in that way.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.800]   Or you could be like, well,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.680]   the Bible is just ideals and standards.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.400]   It's not reality, so we can't really put it into practice.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.560]   If we really tried to put it
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.440]   into practice, we would have zero pastors.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.540]   Like that kind of mentality is also erroneous.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.700]   So legalism and liberalism are two sides of the same coin.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.400]   It's biblical illiteracy on steroids.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.220]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.780]   Okay? Legalism is biblical illiteracy.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.220]   Liberalism is also biblical illiteracy,
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.740]   and they're the same -- they're like the same.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.560]   It's just the opposite application.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.060]   What we want to do is understand what Paul's intent was
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.340]   and to apply it to the best of our ability,
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.580]   and that's going to be messy.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.760]   That's going to be all kinds of exceptions are going to come
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.540]   up into our heads, all kinds of examples are going to come up,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.480]   all kinds of just what ifs, but we want to apply it
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.420]   as if Paul was here instructing us with this text,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.840]   this is how you're supposed to set up leaders.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.560]   Follow me?
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.720]   Okay? So exegesis is the interpreter makes the scripture
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.660]   say what God has to say.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.480]   Eisegesis is the interpreter makes the scripture say what he
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.660]   wants it to say, and we have so much of that going on.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.000]   Every false doctrine comes from eisegesis.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.560]   Okay? The Bible can't mean that.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.480]   Like I had a really godly pastor, but he ended
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.320]   up getting a divorce from his wife, but he did
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.680]   so much to bring me to faith.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.200]   He's God's servant.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.240]   Now that's subjective experience.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   That's eisegesis.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.760]   You guys following that logic?
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.440]   Okay? We want to be careful.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:13.860]   So when we look at verse 6, we're going to kind of go inside
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.120]   and then we're going to just go broad.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.280]   All right?
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.420]   What does verse 6 have to say about elders,
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.120]   and then what does verse 1, 4 through 9 have to say
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.200]   about elders, and then what does the whole of the epistle
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   of Titus have to say indirectly, directly about leaders,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.740]   and then what do 1 and 2, Timothy have to say,
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.900]   and then we're going to go even broader.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.800]   What does the whole Bible have to say about the kinds
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.400]   of men God would delight to have lead his people?
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   So before we look at, say, hey, Titus 1, 6 says,
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.440]   having children who believe.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.560]   I know that guy.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.380]   He's a pastor.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:51.880]   I know him.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.400]   He teaches well, but his son's not a believer.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.960]   He needs to get out of the pulpit.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.880]   Ooh, that's biblical illiteracy.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.940]   If that's all you're going off of.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.740]   Okay? So we've got to be very careful and precise.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:07.040]   So I'm going to look at above approach first.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.480]   This is an easy one.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.740]   It literally is a combination of ah, which is not,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.960]   and the enkaleo, which means call into account.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.600]   There's no reason to put this man on trial.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.440]   Okay? That's what it kind of means.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.280]   Without blame, absence of accusation, unimpeachable,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.400]   irreproachable character.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.700]   So John Stott says, they should offer no loophole
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.980]   for criticism is what he says.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.860]   And then I added the words in any
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.960]   of the character traits to follow.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.500]   Okay? You're not going to get a perfect person outside
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.820]   of Christ, right?
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.720]   But what you want in a person who's standing
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.860]   up to lead a church is someone who is a flawed man, of course.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.040]   But someone where you really can't accuse him
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.060]   of much outside of just being a sinner.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.560]   Not just you understand that.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.300]   Okay? So above approach does not mean perfect.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.180]   The word perfect is actually a different word,
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.200]   unblemished, a momos.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.780]   Okay? And that's not the word that Paul uses here.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.080]   It's basically you can't tell him to,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.260]   there's nothing really to disqualify the guy.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.240]   And I just have to make something up then.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.580]   Okay? So that's the kind of person who is above approach.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.640]   There's really nothing that you can say that says
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.020]   that this man is not Christ-like.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.220]   So this man is Christ-like.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.900]   And with each passing season of his life,
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.560]   he grows more Christ-like.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.480]   And that's a man above approach.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.120]   And then the husband of one wife.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.100]   I'm sure you guys have had some,
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.660]   maybe some colorful questions and just curiosity here.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.160]   It literally means one woman husband.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.260]   Okay? G'nai is actually, it could be translated woman.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.300]   Jesus calls his mom G'nai.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.660]   Okay? He doesn't, like, he's like, G'nai.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.340]   He doesn't mean wife.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.100]   That's his mama.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.020]   Okay? So one woman husband.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.900]   What the conclusion is this, okay?
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.820]   An unsullied reputation in the whole area of sex and marriage.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.940]   Simple enough?
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.280]   Okay? So you're going to probably have all these
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.460]   different exceptions in your head that can come
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.640]   up as possible, huh, what about this?
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.120]   What about this?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.620]   What about that?
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.480]   The big picture is when you look at this man,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.900]   he is devoted fiercely to his wife.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.080]   It doesn't mean that they never fight.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.820]   It doesn't mean, like, they have a perfect marriage.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.860]   But it means he is devoted to his wife in both attitude,
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.240]   thought, and action, and reputation.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.040]   There is zero doubt that he loves his wife and family
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.700]   and is committed to her and is not going to cheat on her.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.260]   So that's pretty much one woman husband.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.540]   Okay? What it doesn't mean is a widower who is remarried.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.980]   It doesn't mean an elder.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.800]   So it's like an elder is an unmarried person,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.360]   or if a person's unmarried, oh, he needs a wife.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.460]   He can't be an elder.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.740]   So that's not what it means.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.520]   Okay? Because if you want to try to apply it overly strictly,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.760]   then you end up with some faulty application.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.080]   So that's the -- those are the easy ones.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.320]   Okay?
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:32.100]   [ Pause ]
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.360]   Can we -- yeah.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.840]   Oops. No, no.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.900]   Can you -- can you -- ah.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.520]   All right.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:39.900]   Never mind.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.780]   The animation didn't work.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.020]   It's this TV stuff.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.480]   It's like all this technical stuff that --
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.440]   all right.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:44.940]   So next slide.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.240]   Okay? The bottom part wasn't supposed
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.000]   to show up for you.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.120]   It was supposed to be like this.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.540]   All right?
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.040]   But don't cheat.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.980]   Okay? So verse six is a little bit tricky
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.940]   when it comes to children.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.220]   So there is an interpretive problem here
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.140]   that we must pause to consider,
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.640]   says one commentator, Philip Towner.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:11.460]   Okay? The word pista, it means believing,
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.200]   reliable, or faithful.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   Okay? It's translated believing,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.640]   or reliable, or faithful.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.940]   Even in the book of Titus,
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.980]   it's used two other times,
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.300]   and it's not translated believing.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.420]   Okay? So does this mean believing,
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.320]   or faithful/trustworthy?
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.400]   That's a big difference.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.620]   What if my kid is not a Christian,
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.800]   but he's a pretty upright dude?
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.940]   What if my daughter is very moral,
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.840]   pays her taxes, and does all this stuff,
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.960]   but she just can't bring herself
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.880]   to a saving knowledge of Christ?
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.040]   So there are questions there.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.740]   Okay? So believing
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.060]   versus faithful/trustworthy.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.300]   And the kinds of thoughts
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.140]   that probably will come
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.820]   to your mind are these.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.600]   A leader in the church whose children are
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.720]   clearly nonbelievers might pop
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.340]   up in your head.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.700]   Famous celebrity pastors whose children
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.600]   have strayed from the faith might pop
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.240]   up in your head.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.660]   A leader with young children
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:16.660]   who have not professed faith
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.360]   in Christ become a what if.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.500]   Okay? I don't think my kids are believers.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.940]   Does that disqualify me?
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.600]   They're six.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.300]   Okay? So my child has made one too many
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.200]   mistakes for me to serve as a leader.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.000]   So if I'm a 60-year-old person
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.340]   with an adult child,
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.820]   but that child has made a pretty bad
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.960]   mistake in his life,
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.040]   does that disqualify me?
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.200]   Pastors or elders forcing their children
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.280]   to fake a profession or behave, perform.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.140]   So if you abuse this verse,
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.220]   and I'm trying to get my kids
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.460]   to fake being Christians
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.200]   so that I'm not disqualified,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.800]   I may end up with all kinds
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.580]   of bad fruit down the line.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.380]   You guys can kind of see how
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.260]   that happens, right?
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.980]   So PKs oftentimes
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.100]   by reputation are either really
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.060]   like holy moly or they stray.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.980]   Not just if you knew this.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.120]   Yeah. But I think part
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.800]   of it psychologically may be the fact
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.900]   that they have all this pressure
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.220]   with all the eyes looking on them
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.020]   and maybe even mom or dad saying,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.920]   "You can't do that.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.960]   You're a pastor's kid.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.460]   You can't buy that.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.340]   You're a pastor's kid."
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.320]   And so you pile on years of you need
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.440]   to perform a certain way
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.520]   without really affecting areas
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:32.960]   of the heart.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.300]   So we can all do damage
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.200]   if we misapply this to my kids,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.080]   to Pastor Mark's kids,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.120]   to Pastor Nate's kids,
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.980]   the elders' kids.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.480]   So this is very important
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.500]   to know how to apply this, okay?
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.160]   So I'm going to review a little bit.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.820]   What does Titus 1,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.920]   4 through 9 have to say?
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.700]   What does all of Titus have to say?
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.300]   What do the pastoral epistles have
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:55.760]   to say?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.420]   And my arms don't stretch any wider.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.680]   But what does the whole Bible have
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.460]   to say about the kinds
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.080]   of men God would have delight
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.960]   to lead his people?
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.020]   I read that wrong.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.040]   But you guys understand the gist, okay?
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.400]   So I'm going to go back.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.540]   So the NASB made a little bit
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.620]   of an unclear translation.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.180]   The not accused of dissipation
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.720]   or rebellion in the grammar,
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.920]   in the Greek, it's connected
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.520]   to the children.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.920]   It's not connected to the person.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.780]   But the NASB is the only one
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.120]   that kind of leaves it like, huh.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.740]   So some of you guys are thinking
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.060]   like, then why use the NASB?
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.040]   We have our reasons, okay?
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.640]   Don't worry about that.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.540]   But the NASB makes it look like,
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.560]   that's just another
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.120]   like a couple of words.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.700]   But in the Greek construction,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.440]   teknon, exon, pista, me,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.180]   it's all connected, okay?
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.240]   So there's this whole thing
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:48.900]   about the children.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.780]   But the word that's kind
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.580]   of the hinging word is this word
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:52.960]   pista.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.860]   In the New Testament,
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.460]   whenever pista is used
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.980]   in the passive,
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.120]   it's usually in reference
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.840]   to let's say God's faithfulness,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.540]   God's or Christ's faithfulness
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.340]   or trustworthiness of God's words.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.240]   Believability, trustability, okay?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.480]   Titus 1.6 is in the passive.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.580]   And Titus 1.9, Titus 3.8,
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.420]   also use the word pista
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.060]   in the passive.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.740]   Active use of pista
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.040]   in the New Testament,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.280]   it's used of people
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.120]   who clearly are believers.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.760]   And I have a list
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.360]   of references there.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.260]   These slides are going
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.560]   to be made available to you.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.420]   So you don't need to like write
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.400]   down everything, okay?
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.560]   The slides I'm going to put up.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.520]   And unbelievers are never referred
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.720]   to as faithful or pista
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.640]   when you're using an active voice, okay?
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.680]   But this kind of makes you question
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.060]   like in a passive voice,
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.440]   the child has pista.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.160]   Does that demand
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.960]   that that child is a believer?
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.780]   It's a little bit inconclusive
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.500]   and hard to fully nail it
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.100]   down just from this verse.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.700]   All right?
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.880]   So when I'm looking at this,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.540]   there's a tension.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.700]   Because I don't want to get this wrong.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.140]   Does this mean a child is just
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.960]   like not rebellious,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.500]   not disobedient,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.020]   but is just upright?
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.740]   Are there cultural things going
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.100]   on here?
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.020]   Because in this period of time,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.820]   it was a lot more,
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.780]   think of an Asian culture,
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.600]   like old school Asian,
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.980]   where whatever dad says goes
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.600]   for the family.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.000]   So for a dad to say,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   "We are believing in Jesus Christ."
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.680]   For a kid to push against it
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.200]   and say, "No, I'm going
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.900]   to live against this."
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.580]   It's actually a very active
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.940]   like pushing
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.560]   against the father's wishes.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.400]   So is this pointing to the fact
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.340]   that a child has
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.600]   to have saving faith?
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.920]   Chapter 1, verse 6,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.260]   I personally don't conclude
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:23.940]   that it does.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.540]   Okay? So I'm going to leave it
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.900]   at that because our inductive
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.280]   Bible study, the goal is not
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.040]   to come to conclusions.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.120]   The goal is to learn how
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.520]   to feed and to learn how
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   to carefully exegete.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.080]   Okay? So I'm going to go
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.220]   to a slightly different passage.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.100]   So I'm looking at Titus 1, 6.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.280]   Hmm. Titus 1, 4 through 9.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.880]   Huh, not convinced.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.300]   All of Titus.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.980]   Ooh, pista is used differently.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.160]   Then I'm going to go
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.900]   to 1 Timothy.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.900]   All right?
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.320]   The other epistles.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.420]   An overseer then must be
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.180]   above reproach.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.740]   These are kind of similar
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.620]   listings.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.400]   The husband of one wife,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.720]   temperate, prudent, respectable,
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.880]   hospitable, able to teach,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   not addicted to wine
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.140]   or pugnacious, but gentle,
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.100]   peaceable, free from the love
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.460]   of money.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.940]   So far it's pretty similar.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.320]   He must be one
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.740]   who manages his own
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.820]   household well,
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.840]   keeping his children
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.900]   under control.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.040]   With all dignity.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:40.100]   That doesn't quite make me feel
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.180]   like, okay, believer.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.120]   He has to be a believer.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.740]   So now this is where it's tricky.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:52.180]   Are these lists non-negotiables?
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.420]   When you see a list
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.180]   of qualifications for an elder,
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.960]   are these non-negotiables?
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.660]   Or are these kind
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.420]   of unattainable ideals
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.700]   that elders should try their best
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.960]   to model, but it's okay
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.460]   if they don't?
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.760]   Or are these things,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.780]   things that would be nice
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.000]   to have in an elder,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.860]   but not essential?
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.260]   We would rather have an elder
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.940]   who could preach well,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.600]   who could teach well,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.760]   who's good at organization,
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.640]   who's good at management,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.520]   who's good at taking care
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:24.960]   of the kids,
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.360]   who's really gifted speaker,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.620]   is a great communicator,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.440]   writes books, has a PhD,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.000]   yeah, character, whatever.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.280]   And the reason I pose these
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.240]   questions is depending
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.620]   on how you view,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.700]   which side you choose is going
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.620]   to end up kind
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.920]   of what you value in a church.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.220]   Non-church,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.000]   you kind of understand.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.660]   Okay? I am absolutely convinced
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.220]   it's the first one.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.560]   Are these non-negotiables?
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.260]   Non-negotiables, absolutely.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.700]   Then it gets me spiritually
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.500]   constipated,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.600]   emotionally confused,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.080]   logically like disrupted.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.560]   Okay? One, six,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.800]   it's not fully clear.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   It's not fully conclusive.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.420]   But I want to take this seriously.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.320]   So what do I do?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.340]   So before I make a judgment
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.420]   or a conclusion saying, okay,
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.060]   if an elder, let's say,
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.580]   the child hits 18 and says,
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.460]   you know what?
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.880]   I'm done with Christianity.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.220]   I'm no longer going
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.000]   to follow Christ.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.020]   I'm done with church.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.280]   See you, dad.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.400]   Does the pastor have to,
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.320]   or the elder have to come
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:39.940]   to the church and say,
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.360]   you know what?
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.780]   I don't live up to Titus 1.6.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.280]   My child has disowned the faith,
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.040]   and I should no longer serve
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.080]   as an elder of this church.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.440]   Is that the proper application?
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.360]   And it gets really tricky
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.280]   because a lot of the situations
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.720]   that these play out in real life
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.660]   are not very simple.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.620]   Would you guys agree
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.640]   that it's not simple at all?
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.980]   Yeah. If I listed the celebrity
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.180]   pastors whose one kid
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.480]   or two kids don't believe,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.580]   we would lose a lot of our leaders.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.220]   But then I'm absolutely convinced
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.140]   that these are non-negotiables.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.240]   They're not suggestions.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.080]   Then my dilemma is I have to try
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.880]   to figure out what the spirit
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.720]   of the law is,
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.780]   not necessarily the letter,
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.320]   how Paul would address
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.200]   this situation,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.920]   and I got to dig deep
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.200]   into all the scriptures
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.540]   to find a conclusion.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.540]   If this whole thing hinges
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.960]   on one word and one verse, okay,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.140]   in 32,000 verses
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.120]   of the scriptures,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.140]   in 1,190 chapters
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.060]   of the whole Bible, one word,
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.060]   one verse, it hinges upon this,
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.640]   I need extra help.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.200]   And God says he gives it,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.300]   John 16, 13,
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.460]   the spirit himself will lead you
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.100]   into all truth.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.860]   But that's why we need to dig deep
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.700]   into the source.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.080]   And I'm not going
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:05.980]   to give you a conclusion
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.160]   because in some ways,
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.800]   it's still in process.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.860]   You guys follow me on this?
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.100]   Okay. Then I go back to
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.720]   and then I'm tired
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.420]   of just looking down
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.640]   so that I'm going to pop back up.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.400]   And I'm going to look at all
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.620]   of Titus again, okay.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.820]   And then I'm going to look
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.160]   at these charts and the words
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.080]   that I made last week.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.960]   And then I think through, all right,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.740]   how do I get Maddie and Charis,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.080]   my two kids, not to disqualify me
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.700]   from ministry, okay,
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   because the wife won,
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.460]   that's on me.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.860]   Well, the kids won technically,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.440]   but I can't control my own heart.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.580]   How am I going to manipulate this
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.660]   boy and this girl?
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.620]   And they're sinful.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.920]   They're really sinful.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.400]   Okay. How do I get them
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.840]   to follow Christ?
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.960]   And that causes me,
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.360]   when I look at Titus
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.700]   and realizing no amount
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.720]   of my hard work will get them
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.000]   to follow Christ.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.300]   But what will get them
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.060]   to follow Christ is at the end,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.580]   what leads to godliness?
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.560]   Knowledge of the truth,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.420]   chapter one, verse one,
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.040]   the grace of God,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.020]   chapter two, verse 11.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.640]   And work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.480]   chapter three, five.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.720]   I need to pray.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:28.220]   And I will trust that the prayer
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.600]   of a righteous man is powerful
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.280]   and effective,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.880]   assuming I'm a righteous man,
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.800]   that God is eager to answer
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.440]   and to save and to bless,
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.300]   and I will throw myself at God
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.580]   and ask him to change my kids.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.600]   That's my role.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.320]   But where pastors
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.680]   and church leaders go wrong is
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.040]   they try to get the kid
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.920]   to like behave and conform.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.400]   And then the church culture,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.240]   the church village tries
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.000]   to nitpick at that child.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.360]   What abuse that is, right?
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.240]   When at the end of the day
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.460]   when you do a proper study
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.120]   of the scriptures,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.160]   it is not based on me
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.120]   manipulating my kid into faith.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.880]   I can't do much
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.300]   to save my child outside
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:15.680]   of prayer.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.600]   But I could do a lot to get
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.840]   in the way of everything
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.360]   and mess it up.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.600]   So my job as a father,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.080]   as a husband, as a pastor,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.520]   is to make sure everything I'm
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.240]   preaching is biblical,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.440]   that my life looks
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.400]   like what I'm preaching,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.240]   not just in front of you,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.320]   but in front of my wife and kids.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.720]   Yeah, good luck, Peter Chung.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.600]   That's why this is not all
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.160]   dependent on the pastor
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.760]   or the leader.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.320]   The pastor and the leaders
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.160]   absolutely need the prayer
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.640]   of the people.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.280]   Because what's Satan's strategy?
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.160]   Attack the top,
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.600]   divide and conquer, always.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.680]   That's why the next quality,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.360]   the first thing you're going
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.600]   to see after above approach is
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.340]   not self-willed.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.180]   You can't have pastors
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.160]   and elders with agendas
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.440]   who are trying to jockey
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.160]   for position, who have ambition,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.120]   because that always leads
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.760]   to strife.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.400]   But if we're not careful
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.520]   and we're being attacked
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.400]   by spiritual demonic elements
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.920]   to distract or hinder,
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.840]   our church is growing.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   Oh, great.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.360]   We're doing a great job.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.680]   Boom, puffed up.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.320]   There you go.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.520]   Satan's had a small victory
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:41.640]   there.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.300]   You need to pray
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   so that my prayers are also
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.380]   powerful and effective
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.020]   and you need to join me
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.940]   that my kids' salvation,
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.460]   which is not dependent
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.260]   on me anyway,
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.220]   my kids come to faith in Christ,
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.620]   to God's glory,
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.500]   and to the effectiveness
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.300]   of his kingdom building.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.160]   So, verse 6,
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.280]   I have more questions
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:14.840]   than answers,
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.860]   and I've spent the last 30
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.120]   something, like 30 something
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.840]   hours in the last couple days,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.240]   like just trying to figure
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.600]   out how to teach this.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.440]   And I'm so thankful
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.360]   because I actually probably
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.560]   gleaned more than anybody else
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.280]   did because I'm just
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.440]   in the text.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.880]   And I didn't leave
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.560]   with a conclusion.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.200]   And I think that's okay.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.600]   You guys okay with that?
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.940]   We're all still in process
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.580]   of trying to know the whole
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.260]   counsel of God.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.940]   We can't do that
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.740]   on one Wednesday night.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.140]   Okay?
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.620]   And as we grow in the faith,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.180]   as the spirit of God
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.460]   guides us into all truth,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.220]   things will become
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.020]   more and more clear,
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.940]   especially in the areas
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.420]   that are a little bit
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.140]   more complicated
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.220]   and not so simple.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.300]   You guys follow me?
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.260]   Legalism, liberalism,
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.300]   two sides of the same coin.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.100]   Cheap grace and fundamentalist,
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.500]   like abusive tendencies,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.880]   it's the same thing.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.720]   It's immaturity.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.680]   But we need to be a mature
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.160]   people who chew on the meat
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.000]   of the scriptures.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.360]   Amen?
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.160]   Milk, chug, you're done.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.760]   Meat, you chug, you're done.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.200]   You can't do that.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.280]   You need to chew.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.520]   And let's chew this together
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.600]   and then see what next study
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.480]   has to say.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.880]   And then see what chapter
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.480]   two has to say.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.360]   And then see what chapter
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.200]   three has to say.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.520]   And then we'll go to first
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.400]   and second Timothy
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.880]   and 20 years from now maybe
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.240]   we'll have a solid answer.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:38.980]   I'm just kidding.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.620]   Well maybe.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.380]   But certain things you want
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.620]   to tread carefully
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.180]   and ask God humbly for wisdom
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.060]   rather than to jump
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:46.700]   to a conclusion.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.260]   Because especially,
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.460]   I'm sorry for those of you guys
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.340]   who are not Asians,
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.860]   Asians like answers.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.140]   We like conclusion.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.500]   Tell me how I'm supposed
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.060]   to apply this.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.180]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.860]   We really need to kind
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.340]   of let God's word speak.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.300]   All right?
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.060]   So this is the application I'm
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:02.700]   going to leave you with.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.780]   Just from chapters one verses
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.700]   four through six,
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.080]   pray for the leaders' marriages
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.200]   that God will strengthen
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.120]   and protect each of them.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.400]   Pastors' wives won't always
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.240]   disclose whatever challenges
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.520]   that they have nor will pastors
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.320]   because it may become a
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:20.840]   stumbling block.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.440]   Pray for the marriages.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.880]   Okay?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.720]   Pray for just,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.740]   not just that they coexist
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.840]   peacefully but that all our
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.080]   pastors and elders really have
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.560]   just a strong relationship
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.720]   with their spouse
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.460]   so that with just a united
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.240]   heart and mind we're
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:39.920]   ministering together.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.880]   Pray for that.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.320]   Second, pray for the salvation
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.200]   of your spiritual leaders'
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:44.560]   children.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.960]   Okay?
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.760]   And third, pray for God to
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.080]   raise up many more godly
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.000]   leaders from and for the
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.400]   church.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.120]   That's how you can apply this.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.800]   Not go on a witch hunt and try
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   to find out which pastors you
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.760]   need to get off the pulpit,
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   which elders you need
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.320]   to disqualify.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.400]   The application appropriately
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.240]   made from this text is that we
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:06.520]   pray.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.920]   Because it doesn't depend on
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.160]   our effort is what the whole of
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.800]   Titus says.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.320]   It depends on God's grace.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.480]   And help us cleave to the grace
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.120]   of God especially as the needs
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.800]   of the church grow.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.840]   Amen?
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.840]   So I'm going to break you back
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.440]   up into your small groups to
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.800]   just spend some time in prayer
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.560]   and then follow up application,
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.000]   discussion and you can do that
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.800]   as long as you want.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   But just as a quick
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.960]   announcement there's no Bible
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.760]   study next Wednesday.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.320]   Okay?
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.280]   So dun dun dun you have to wait
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.600]   till two weeks from now to see
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.040]   what elders, what other elders
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:40.400]   have to.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.760]   This is a very difficult passage
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.960]   for leadership because it's like
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.280]   our feet are put out to the
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:45.520]   fire.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.240]   But one through seven through
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.920]   nine and then same thing
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.480]   inductive questions observations
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.240]   how do these verses fit into the
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.320]   context of the rest of section
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.120]   chapter letter and then what are
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.680]   some practical and measurable
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.280]   applications you can draw from
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.200]   these verses.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.440]   And that's for Wednesday the 22nd
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.120]   because next Friday we have
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.640]   praise and prayer.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.600]   So we're not here Wednesday.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.280]   We're here Friday.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.800]   All right.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.880]   Okay.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.920]   So yeah I'm going to my
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.760]   computer's about to run out of
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.320]   battery but it is absolutely
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   essential for you guys to pray
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.640]   for the leadership because John
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.960]   McCarthy one thing he says is
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.560]   the church can survive anything
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.480]   except a failure in leadership.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.840]   A failure or factions in
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.920]   leadership a church can survive
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.560]   anything but that.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.040]   And so pray for the strength of
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.520]   our leaders.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.680]   And pray for more leaders to
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.000]   come up.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.160]   Amen.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.120]   And let me pray and then I'll
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.240]   let you go back to your small
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:41.440]   groups.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.120]   Father we are weak.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.280]   We are prone to misinterpret.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.320]   We are prone to make subjective
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.160]   opinion.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.840]   Your will for our lives.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.000]   So I pray that you would help us
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.680]   to dive deep into your word.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.640]   And to humbly.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.080]   Trembling before you.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.760]   Seek wisdom.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.160]   And we know that you've said you
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.080]   will gladly give it if we ask in
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.480]   faith.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.880]   So we ask now that you would
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.760]   give us wisdom and insight into
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.640]   your word to know how to apply
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.120]   especially the harder texts in
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.680]   the word of God.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.800]   And so we pray for your help as
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.280]   we pray together that you would
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.840]   help us not to pray religious
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.440]   words or repetitive phrases but
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.040]   help us really to pray and
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:31.880]   intercede.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.840]   Just with our whole hearts in
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.240]   tune with your spirit.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.320]   And we ask these things in Jesus
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:38.480]   name.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.520]   Amen.
