[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   And so today what our goal is, and I'm actually, the way I'm going to approach this is I want
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   to be very practical.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.380]   I want you to see, or hear at least, what I do when I counsel people that are struggling
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.500]   in these particular areas because you need to come away from this conference with tools
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.380]   in an effort to not only counsel your own heart, but in an effort to come alongside
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.120]   other women and counsel them.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.880]   So I'm hoping this will be super practical.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.460]   I always use case studies, so we'll start with a case study.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.220]   And my case studies aren't really one person.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.580]   It's really kind of a combination of people, but you kind of make it into one case study,
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.580]   right?
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.040]   So that you can kind of identify with who I'm talking about because again, scripture
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.500]   says there is no temptation common to man.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.400]   Many many many people in the body of Christ struggle with bitterness.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900]   Many people.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.620]   And so this is a common temptation to man.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.420]   So anyway, I hope this will just kind of facilitate some good discussion in your groups later.
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.700]   I noticed on your schedule that you have to listen to two talks before you get into your
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.700]   groups.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.660]   And so you've got lots of questions to go through, and obviously you probably won't
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.980]   get through them all, but at least it will just kind of facilitate this good interaction
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.700]   that I love so much in an effort to help you apply.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.520]   So let's start with a case study.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.880]   By way of introduction, I'll talk a little bit about Polly.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.860]   So Polly, she's a Christian woman.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.600]   When she came to me for help, she needed some counsel because she explained that her husband,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.960]   who is an unbeliever, so you know, difficult marriage to begin with, she's married to an
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.480]   unbeliever, had become very self-destructive in his life.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   Most of that was due to the fact that he was really enslaved to alcohol, and this was starting
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.360]   to come out more and more in his life.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.840]   He was able to hide it for a while, but of course anybody that's enslaved to alcohol,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.560]   it'll begin to show over time.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   And so it had an impact in his life, in his marriage, at his workplace, and all of the
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   rest.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.420]   And so over time, it became evident that when Polly came to me for help, what was really
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.240]   going on, what is kind of a common thing that women will do, is they look for a way of escape.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.720]   So what do you think she tried to ask me?
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.320]   Do you think she really wanted help for her bitterness, or do you think she wanted help
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.400]   to find out if she had grounds for divorce?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   What do you think?
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   I'd probably divorce you.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, you would be right.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.760]   She was actually looking for a way.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.680]   She wondered if I could give her counsel on how to get out of this marriage.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.640]   And so in the process of meeting with this dear soul, who was really hurting, you know,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.000]   I mean, sure, she's struggling with bitterness, no doubt, but she's also a sufferer, right?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.320]   And so you've got to have compassion for people like that.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.200]   And in an effort to just kind of minister to her soul, I just said, "Hey, you know,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.880]   let's just meet for a while.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.720]   Let's just meet for a while, and let's just explore what God's Word has to say.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   And let's just allow the Spirit to do a work, and allow me to be sort of your stretcher
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.360]   bearer, you know, someone who comes alongside and just really encourages you to that end."
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.560]   And so that's kind of how we started our relationship.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.360]   I was not going to give her any kind of indication that she could get out of this marriage, you
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   know.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.440]   She needed to try to, you know, just endure if she could.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.640]   It's difficult when a person, especially a believer, I would say, finds herself bitter.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.920]   Hebrews 12, 15 talks about that.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.520]   It points out that bitterness just has the potential to cause so much trouble in our
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.400]   lives, and not only in our lives, but in the lives of people around us.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.960]   You know, when you think about it, I mean, just think of a bitter person right now that
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   you might know.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.000]   Just think of how much trouble their life is, because it's just so heart deep.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.320]   And it has the potential, when we're bitter, to defile so many.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.720]   And so you can imagine that when someone is stuck in bitterness, the consequences of that.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.560]   I know of churches that have divided over this issue of bitterness.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.080]   Of course, I know of marriages that have dissolved.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.520]   I know of friendships that have been broken, all because of this bitterness issue that
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.040]   they struggle with, and the lack of forgiveness that ensues.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.400]   I work on a college campus.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.440]   This is such a common thing amongst roommates in dorms, you know, when they get on the wrong
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.040]   side of each other.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.400]   So again, it just causes so much trouble in a person's life.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.760]   And so I kind of have a four-fold goal that I'm going to go over with you this morning,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.240]   a way that I would approach this in counseling.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   The first thing is we've got to define it.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   How do we biblically define bitterness?
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.240]   What does it actually mean in the Bible?
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.800]   And I've used extra biblical resources to define that, because the three people that
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.320]   I've quoted on your outline are people that I trust, people that love God's Word, and
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   are biblical counselors.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.040]   And it kind of just gives you a picture of what it is.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   And then we're going to examine some evidences of bitterness in a person's life.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.560]   Bitterness, the way that we would describe it as counselors is you've got behaviors and
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.320]   actions, and we call that the above-ground fruit, what I see in your life, what is coming
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.080]   out of your mouth.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.260]   And then we've got what's driving the behavior.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.340]   That's what's happening in the heart level.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.640]   And so we'll look at the evidences of bitterness, how I know that you're struggling that way,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.280]   and then we'll look at the heart behind it, what you really need to be repenting of.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.040]   Bitterness is a behavior or an attitude, but what is causing that?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.200]   What is driving that?
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.680]   What is the ruling desire behind that?
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.160]   That's the difference between biblical counseling and psychology.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.800]   We're not just dealing with the behavior.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.400]   We really need to look at a soul level as to what is driving some of these issues in
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.440]   our life.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.400]   We are body-soul people, okay?
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.520]   That's what we believe as Christians.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   We have a body and we have a soul.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.680]   And so at the soul level, what's happening there?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.840]   And then finally, we'll just kind of look at some biblical and practical steps, things
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.000]   that I would do as a friend to someone that's struggling.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.280]   How would I practically walk her through the scriptures?
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.040]   How would I have her help?
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.800]   How would I help her, basically?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.920]   And it's just, it's not rocket science.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.080]   This is something that you all can do.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   We actually know from the book of Romans that we who know the Lord, we can come alongside
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.360]   and we can counsel one another.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.920]   This isn't just for someone like me that has a lot of degrees in counseling and all of
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   that.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.440]   This is actually something that all believers can do in the body of Christ.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.800]   So let's begin with that definition, or a few definitions, really.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.200]   The definition of bitterness.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.800]   What is bitterness?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.440]   So on your outline there, the first one that you have that defines bitterness is actually
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.000]   my boss, Dr. John Street.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.640]   He's a wonderful biblical counselor and Christian, and he's done a lot of work in this area.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:37.600]   And he says that bitterness is a perpetual, intense hostility and resentment that leads
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.520]   to harsh treatment and unloving opinion of others.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.640]   And so notice the words that he used there.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.040]   There's perpetual, so it's ongoing.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.800]   It's very intense on the inside.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.080]   It's a resentment, and from that leads to a certain kind of action in a person.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.640]   The second definition is another biblical counselor, a friend out in St. Louis.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:09.840]   She's written lots of articles about this topic, and she says that bitterness is unresolved,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.280]   unforgiven anger and resentment.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.240]   It is the result of anger changing from an experience to a belief, and bitterness is
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.960]   seething and constant.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.800]   Bitter people carry the same burdens as angry people, but to a much greater extent.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   And I think she says that because bitterness is an attitude.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.720]   You know, it's something that we're thinking upon.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.040]   But again, she's kind of majoring on the fact that it's a resentment.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.960]   We're not just experiencing bitterness.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.560]   We now believe, we feel justified in our bitterness, which people often do.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.480]   And then the third one, Lou Priolo, he authored a book.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   It's going to be in the resources at the end of our talk, a booklet really that's called
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.720]   Bitterness, the Root that Pollutes.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.440]   And interestingly, I think it's an excerpt out of a bigger work that he did when someone
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.800]   breaks up in a dating relationship, How Not to Grow Bitter.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.680]   But nonetheless, it's just a great little pamphlet that you could take anybody through
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.720]   that just helps you to think about it biblically.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:21.480]   And he says that bitterness is a resentful, unforgiving attitude which cuts and pricks
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   others as well.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.520]   To put it another way, bitterness is the result of responding improperly or unbiblically to
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.020]   an offense.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:37.720]   And bitterness is also the result of dwelling too long on a hurt.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   So where does bitterness begin?
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.500]   Well, from these definitions, it isn't too hard to see.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.720]   It begins to take root in our hearts when first, we've been hurt in some way.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.080]   So just kind of think about how it all gets started.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.320]   You're hurt by someone.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.540]   Someone's offended you.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.480]   It's usually where it begins.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.440]   And you begin to dwell on it.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.840]   And you think about it.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.780]   And you think about it a lot.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.360]   And it just consumes your thoughts.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.060]   And then, you know, you don't deal with it biblically.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.980]   You either don't go to the person to let them know that they've offended you or you don't
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.040]   choose to forgive them from the heart and you just continue to kind of keep a list of
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   wrongs.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.760]   And so that can obviously lend itself to a lot of harsh treatment of others as a result.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.220]   Now, I know that you're thinking, "Well, I'm a Christian.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.680]   And I know intellectually and I know biblically that when I'm offended or sinned against by
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.560]   someone that I'm called by Christ to handle it, but biblically."
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   Well, of course, of course that's true.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.000]   We all are called that way.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.200]   And when we say biblically, what that means is that I am saying that I'm resolved to ultimately
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.680]   refuse to retaliate against somebody.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.120]   And instead, for love's sake, kind of release that offender from his obligation to suffer
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.660]   this penalty of restitution.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.680]   And that's kind of what we would call attitudinal forgiveness.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.760]   But even though we know this biblically, and even though that we know because of Christ
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:21.280]   we have the capacity to forgive and even trust Christ for the outcome, too often we don't
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.480]   choose God's way, right?
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.360]   Too often.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.720]   And instead, we keep that record of wrong and we kind of grow anxious over it.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.480]   And so it's really that unbiblical thinking.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.720]   I'd like to say the battle starts in the mind.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.000]   Because when you start thinking unbiblically about something, you know, eventually the
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.440]   seeds of that begin to take root in the heart and it sprouts all kinds of bad fruit like
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   bitterness in your life.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.040]   And again, you know, it has the potential to destroy marriages, to destroy friendships.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.600]   Let me just ask you, just to kind of get you involved a little bit, how many of you know
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   friendships that have suffered because of bitterness?
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   Raise your hand.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   Be honest.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   Lots.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   How about marriages?
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   How about churches?
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   Anybody?
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   See?
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.400]   I mean, it's really, really something that's important to talk about.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.280]   And so there are just going to be so many women that will need your love and your care
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.560]   and your concern over this issue.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.720]   So in Polly's case, kind of getting back to our gal now, really what was happening with
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:32.160]   her, she kind of just had certain desires and expectations of her husband when they
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.480]   first married.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:41.360]   And when those desires were unmet, these expectations that she had when they were unmet, she began
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.600]   to retaliate towards her husband in a particular way.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.040]   So she wasn't getting what she wanted.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.640]   She had expectations.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.200]   And so when she began to retaliate, she just started to believe that what was happening
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.800]   to her was unfair and unjust because he had claimed he was a Christian, apparently, when
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.520]   they married, but he misrepresented himself.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.160]   And so she began to believe that her bitterness was justified because he, in a sense, defrauded
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   her.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.960]   A lot of people feel that way.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.760]   And of course, it's a difficult situation and it can feel unjust, but it doesn't give
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.000]   you justification, right, to grow bitter against somebody.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.040]   And so when she came to me for counsel, it just really kind of gave me an opportunity
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   to hear her story.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.600]   That's what I usually let people do.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.400]   You know, just tell me your story.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   I want to know.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.320]   I want to know what's going on.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.280]   Help me to understand your world.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.280]   Help me to understand your context.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:45.520]   I take some notes and then I can kind of begin to open up scriptures and to help her to understand.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.920]   But, you know, even though this is happening, you didn't learn Christ this way.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.640]   Christ doesn't teach us to grow bitter against people just because you're not getting what
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.000]   you want.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.080]   And so, you know, we opened up the Bible.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.960]   And so that's what I'll invite you to do now.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.760]   Go ahead and open up to Ephesians 4.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.880]   We'll begin in 31.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.960]   Maybe a familiar verse to you.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.520]   Apostle Paul is talking here.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:26.080]   Of course, he's under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.520]   And when you get to Ephesians 41, beginning in 31, he says, really the last two verses
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:44.320]   of this chapter, he says, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.720]   be put away from you along with all malice.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:56.060]   Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.060]   forgiven you."
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.880]   One thing that I do when I meet with someone and I'm taking them to the Word, I actually
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.380]   let them read it.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.680]   You know, I'll say, "Hey, let's look at Scripture and just go ahead and go to Ephesians
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.280]   4 and why don't you read out loud verses 31 to 32?"
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.240]   And the reason why I do that is because I firmly believe in a sufficient Word and the
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.880]   Word has authority.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.640]   And so I know that the Holy Spirit is going to use that to convict their heart.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.160]   So I have a really firm conviction that way and you ought to as well.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.640]   You don't have to, you're not the Holy Spirit, you know, you're not going to make people
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   change.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   It's a work of God.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   He does that through His Word.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.800]   And I'll often have them read it.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.760]   And so Polly did read it and I just reminded her of a few important things after she finished
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   reading.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   I reminded her that this is an exhortation for believers, you know, and Polly said she
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.720]   was a professing believer.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.200]   And this is part of the section in Ephesians, if you're familiar with the letter, that is
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.000]   part of our responsibility as believers to one another.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.920]   You know, if you've spent any time here, maybe your pastor has preached through the book
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:12.440]   of Ephesians, but you know, in this section, Paul is exhorting believers to put away or
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.800]   abandon all of the different sins that are mentioned in here.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:23.440]   Even if you go back to verse 1 of Ephesians 4, if you look there, that very first word,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.200]   typically in most, well if you have the ESV translation, I think it says "I therefore"
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.040]   or if you have NASV, it says "therefore I," it just kind of reverses the words.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.760]   But what's the "therefore therefore," right?
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.580]   And the "therefore" is there because Paul is basing his exhortation in this section
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:49.040]   of Ephesians on all of the doctrine that he's just taught in Ephesians 1 to 3.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.800]   And so, you know, that's important to note.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   It's as if he is saying, "Beloved, you know, here is what your Savior's done for you."
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.120]   Ephesians 1 to 3.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   It talks about all the things that God has done for us in terms of salvation.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.680]   Here is what your Savior has done for you.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.080]   So in light of this great salvation that's been bestowed upon you because of God's great
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:18.160]   mercy and great love, you ought to live like the new creature that you are.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.480]   That's really the whole point.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.840]   He's trying to show us positionally we're in Christ and so we have this capacity to
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.360]   live for God.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.640]   I mean, after all, don't we believe that we're no longer dead in our trespasses and
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.400]   sins?
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.760]   And we believe that because we know that it's only because of God's mercy.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.460]   He's the one that's redeemed our hearts.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.200]   We know, we just celebrated the resurrection, that we're believers are also alive in Christ.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.600]   We're not dead in our sin, we're alive in Christ.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.160]   We're dead to sin, but we're alive to walk in a new life.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.240]   And so Paul is just saying, in light of all those things, I'm beseeching you now, I am
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:02.960]   exhorting you now, I am encouraging you heartily now to walk in a manner worthy of your calling.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   And if you read through the whole chapter of chapter four, you're going to learn that
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.000]   he exhorts you to walk in newness of life.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.880]   He wants you to be, he's calling us to be humble.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.960]   He's calling us to be gentle.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.160]   He's calling us to be patient.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.200]   He's calling us to love, to have unity, to be eager to maintain unity in the body of
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.840]   Christ.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.200]   He's calling us to be holy.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.880]   He's calling us to be pure.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:35.440]   And of course, here in our little two verses, he's calling us really to be forgiving.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.520]   And so bitterness, though, and all of those other things he describes, all of those other
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:47.440]   attitudes and actions of anger, those things were to put away, you know, because it's connected
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.680]   with your old man, that old self before Christ.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.600]   Because again, as believers, we're new creations.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.440]   Our life is to be set apart from the world.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   Your life needs to look different.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.920]   It needs to reflect Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.000]   And bitterness is not a part of that character, okay?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.280]   So just kind of thinking through that a little bit.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.600]   In the original language, if you were to kind of look at that word when it was written in
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:23.840]   its heart language, if you will, the word that Paul uses for bitterness is "procreia."
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.760]   And it just means that when a person is bitter, what's happening there is they have this resentful
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.320]   frame of mind.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.440]   There's just a lot of harshness going on.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:42.080]   There's an unsettled hostility, and it's beginning to poison the inner man or the inner woman.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.920]   If you were to kind of literally translate what he is saying there, he's saying literally
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.240]   that all manner of bitterness and violent outbreaks of wrath and anger and brawling
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.160]   and slanderous speech needs to be put away from you together with all manner of malice.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.000]   And so the idea is for us as believers to abandon, you know, think about that word,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.920]   just to completely abandon any kind of bitterness or any kind of mental condition, really, that's
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.360]   connected with your old man.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:22.040]   And instead, as verse 32 indicates, we are to be becoming kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.520]   each other even as and just as God in Christ has forgiven us.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.120]   And of course, that's connected, our characteristic of a true disciple.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.040]   If you're a true disciple of Christ, this positionally is what you are, and this is
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.440]   what you should be striving towards.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.800]   I mean, we obviously, I'm not teaching perfection here.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.560]   I know there's a residue of sin.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.480]   You know, I have reformed theology like you do.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.200]   I know that there's a residue of sin, but we can still strive towards being becoming.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:56.400]   In fact, we'll look at it a little bit later, but he's saying you're not completely 100%
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.840]   kind or tenderhearted or forgiving.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.520]   He's saying be becoming those things.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.940]   So he's sanctifying you as you go along.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:08.600]   And so the point is we're to live new lives, and by God's grace, we do that when we begin
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.400]   to root out bitterness in our lives.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.520]   But in order to do that, it's really important, you know, maybe some of your friends that
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.080]   you're thinking of right now, maybe they don't know that they're bitter.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.760]   Maybe they're just not seeing it.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.340]   Maybe you see it.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.160]   And so sometimes what I'll do is I'll just point to some of the evidences that I see
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.400]   in a person's life that are really common to people that are struggling with bitterness.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.880]   And I think that'll help you because it gives you a better picture of what you're going
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.960]   to see, you know, action-wise.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.720]   So let's talk a little bit about the evidences now.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.320]   And one thing I want to point out, as a believer, you know, we can see evidences in a person's
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.920]   life and kind of figure that this is probably what they're struggling with, but we're not
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.160]   God.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:57.400]   So I can't say 100% that's what it is, but fruit helps us to understand probably what's
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   going on.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.880]   And it's your job to ask a lot of questions and to ask the Holy Spirit to help you with
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.960]   discernment.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.560]   And that's the super, super helpful when it comes to helping people.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.920]   You know, Matthew 15, 19, Jesus says very clearly, "It's out of the heart that comes
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.640]   evil thoughts and murder and adultery and sexual immorality and theft and false testimony
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640]   and slander."
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.760]   So he's just trying to point out that it's from the heart the mouth speaks.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's from the heart behavior flows, that kind of thing.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.640]   So let's kind of look at some of these evidences.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.920]   The first one that I have on your outline there is withdrawing.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.540]   I put this at the top of the list because it's probably the most common one I see.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.440]   And I know because people are hiding when they're bitter and they're angry at people.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.960]   Sometimes when we're hurt, sometimes when we're offended by another person, we just
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.920]   choose not to deal with that situation at all.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.640]   And so we succumb to retaliating in some particular way.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.800]   And one way to retaliate, quite honestly, is to withdraw from the relationship.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.560]   You know, you think that you're being a peacemaker, but actually you're being a peacekeeper because
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.000]   you're not dealing with it.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.480]   You're just withdrawing from that person.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.640]   Okay, it's a big difference.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.160]   And this is more or less what I call really passive retaliation because in a sense what
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:26.200]   you're doing is you're just depriving that person who's offended you with your presence
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:31.240]   rather than moving towards them in an effort to resolve conflict biblically.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.620]   In fact, you may even go so far as to plan all your activities avoiding that person altogether.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.620]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.640]   You're at church, someone you're mad at, and you do everything you can to avoid that person.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.960]   Am I the only one that thinks that?
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.480]   Come on, that's so common.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.880]   We all do it.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:56.480]   And we've got to be careful because that is what divides churches.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.160]   But it's going to show up.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.480]   If you have a friend that's struggling in this way, you'll just see it.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.920]   It'll show up in their relationships and how they deal with people for sure.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.720]   My lady that I've been talking about, Polly, it was showing up in her marriage as well.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.160]   It's something that I noticed.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.840]   She was withdrawing from her husband.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.440]   You know, whenever he did something she didn't like or said something that hurt her, she
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.240]   just kind of defaulted to giving him the silent treatment.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.080]   And silent treatment, ladies, is a form of sinful anger.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.360]   It's just a way to say, "I'm not happy with you," right?
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.420]   And so that's kind of how she retaliated against her husband, and it caused so much trouble
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   in her marriage.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.240]   It was really sad.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.200]   Another evidence of bitterness that you will often see in a person that's struggling with
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:52.960]   bitterness is criticism or complaining or even slandering somebody.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.160]   It just depends, you know.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:00.320]   It can be something like criticism as much as something like slander, but it's usually
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   in your speech.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.760]   And you know what I mean, because you hear it when someone's talking about somebody that
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.040]   they're mad at.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.280]   You hear them be very critical against that person or they're slandering them.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:18.080]   And, you know, for example, let's say that a person is embittered towards their friend
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.520]   and you're just kind of hanging out with her and she begins to talk to you, and suddenly
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.760]   you're just kind of noticing, "Wow, you know, her tone and what she's saying is very critical.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.960]   It's very harsh towards that person."
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.920]   And what she's doing is she's trying to put that person in the least possible good light,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   you know?
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.520]   She doesn't want to put her in a good light.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.800]   And if you really listen to her carefully, the criticism usually isn't helpful, right?
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.280]   It's not really meant to help this person.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.320]   It's usually meant to tear the person down, so it's very destructive.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.880]   Or a person who's bitter may be caught up in complaining by venting her bad feelings
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.920]   or her ill will towards that person.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.440]   But it doesn't solve anything, you know?
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.160]   I mean, they're just spouting off, but it doesn't really help the situation.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.560]   They're sinning in their speech.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.120]   And of course, slander is just another evidence in our speech, more embittered.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.480]   And you see this manifested, I think, in the body of Christ when people are just talking
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:25.640]   behind each other's back and they're saying things that just are very negative.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.680]   They want to convince you of this negative stuff that they're saying about this particular
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.440]   person and it's just so dangerous because it really divides the church or even a friendship.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:43.240]   Proverbs 16.28 says that a perverse man stirs up dissension and a gossip separates close
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   friends.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   Isn't that the truth?
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.400]   I mean, it's just so true when you think about that.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.760]   So again, with bitterness, it really divides people.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:58.480]   And what I want to say is that ultimately, you need to know that Satan, your enemy, is
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.080]   very happy about this because his MO is to disunify the body of Christ.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.580]   That's what he's about.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:12.960]   So if he can encourage you to this end, then he's done his job.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.360]   But we live victoriously and we can overcome the enemy, sure, as believers, but I just
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.320]   want you to know this is one of his biggest tools in his toolbox is to cause division
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.420]   in the body of Christ and bitterness will help facilitate that for sure.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.360]   For Polly, how this manifested in her life was more like when she was with her husband,
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.560]   it's more like biting sarcasm, you know, just saying things that are unkind, condescending,
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.480]   being very caustic in her speech, treating her husband like he was a child.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.560]   She often complained that he had a limited intellect, so it's just not very respectful
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.780]   and it kind of played into her sinning against him in this way.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.860]   Another one is just difficulty resolving conflict.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.200]   People that are bitter just have a difficulty here.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.540]   You know, it's kind of like Lou Priolo says, "Resolving conflicts with a person who's bitter
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:10.020]   or a person who's unwilling to forgive is like trying to build a skyscraper without
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.040]   first laying a solid foundation."
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.300]   And, you know, in other words, the bitterness is just going to doom the project before it
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.800]   even gets off the ground.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.460]   You know, and this is kind of the reason why.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:27.280]   When you're bitter, what you're doing is you're keeping a list of wrong.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.000]   You're constantly thinking about that person and you're just adding to the list all the
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.320]   wrongs that they've done to you.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.680]   And so you're bearing a grudge.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.900]   And when you bear a grudge against a person, when it comes time to working out the conflict
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:47.400]   because you haven't dealt with your attitude of bitterness, it will still go unresolved
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.960]   because you'll just think of other reasons why, you know, you think they should come
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.320]   to you or whatever.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.680]   And so it just kind of goes on and on and it just becomes an occasion to add another
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.120]   wrong to the list.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.640]   And typically the embittered person will take that list, that record of wrong, and just
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.160]   rehearse it over and over again in their mind.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.400]   You know, that comes from 1 Corinthians 13 because we're not supposed to keep a list
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   of wrongs.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.320]   We're supposed to love people by not keeping a list.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.200]   But at this point we're doing the opposite.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.240]   We're keeping a list.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.040]   And so, you know, again, Polly struggled in this area as well.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.320]   She had gotten to a point where she wasn't really communicating to her husband at all.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.480]   And every time they'd sit down to try to resolve something, it would just blow up into this
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:39.160]   big fight and someone would leave in a huff or withdraw from the situation.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.000]   Another evidence that's common is distrust.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.880]   And this kind of temptation plays out when a person who's bitter has been kind of dwelling
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.600]   on a hurt a little bit too long.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.920]   Even if the offender, someone that's, you know, offended them, comes to them and asks
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:05.680]   for forgiveness, and they even extend forgiveness, sometimes if the offended is still hurt, she
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:13.400]   will often just choose not to trust the person and still will be suspicious.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.000]   And you can imagine, this happens, right, when you're in a relationship, especially,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   you know, if you're married and maybe one of the spouses has committed adultery, but
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   they've repented.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.560]   And so, you know, they're trying to reconcile their relationship, but the spouse that has
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.000]   been sinned against is having a hard time trusting.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.880]   And so that takes time.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:42.320]   They need to build trust because the person's repented and, you know, she's extended forgiveness.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.880]   But you know, again, what happens is you're bitter, you're not dealing with that, and
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.560]   what you're doing is you're choosing to create scenarios in your mind of what might be.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.040]   And that's not fair, because the person has repented at this point.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.480]   In Polly's case, where her distrust came from was just because of some other things.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.400]   She, I think the biggest thing for her is that early on in her marriage, she discovered
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.800]   that her husband wasn't a believer.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.600]   I think he just wanted to get married to her.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.880]   Maybe he was a lukewarm kind of a guy.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.660]   It was enough for her.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.720]   So they got married.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.760]   The first question I asked her, too, was, "Before you guys got married, did you get
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.280]   premarital counseling?
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.680]   Did you seek out your pastor before you made this decision?"
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.400]   And of course, what do you think the answer was?
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.120]   "No."
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.040]   So you know, they didn't seek out wisdom.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.200]   I think that probably would have caused them a lot of, well, it would have helped them
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.640]   quite a bit because maybe the pastor perhaps would have seen some of these red flags had
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.520]   they taken the time, but she just wanted to get married so bad that she went ahead and
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   went for it.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   And so now she's deeply disappointed because he's not the real deal, you know, and he's
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.800]   struggling.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.320]   Another evidence, I think, would just be acts of vengeance or repaying evil for evil.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.400]   You know, when you're deeply hurt, you know, maybe you know someone that's been physically
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.280]   or sexually abused.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.720]   Sometimes a person just wants to get back at somebody.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.980]   You know, they've just been hurt at such a deep level.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.680]   Or maybe someone's gotten fired from work for no reason.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.920]   They don't know why they were fired and they want to get back at the company.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.800]   We see this all the time on the news, right?
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.440]   Or again, you know, maybe we could use the scenario that a spouse has been involved in
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.760]   adultery.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.440]   There's just lots of reasons that people use to motivate them to want to take action and
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.280]   repay evil for evil.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.040]   And really their hope is that their lack of forgiveness will cause the other person that's
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.760]   hurt them to hurt.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.200]   That's kind of their motivation.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.080]   They're not thinking about Christ at all, of course.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   They're only thinking about themselves.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.720]   And, you know, of course, like I said, Polly, she wanted just to abandon the marriage.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.120]   That would be probably the biggest act of vengeance that she could probably do at that
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.080]   point was just to leave him.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.800]   Because she said the total weight of difficulties on her shoulders and she just wanted to get
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   out of it.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.200]   She didn't want to live for the glory of God.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.320]   She wanted to live, she wanted to just have relief.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.520]   Big difference, huh?
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.900]   I just want relief from the pain.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.900]   That's what she was thinking.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.840]   I don't want to live for the glory of God.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.960]   So these are just some things, some evidences.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.360]   This is not an exhaustive list.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.660]   This is just kind of the, what you would commonly see in a person.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.600]   Something that you need to be on the lookout for.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.900]   And they're pretty common.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.760]   But I think a person who's bitter can also have a hard attitude that's intolerant or
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:51.720]   hypersensitive, maybe very impatient, somebody that has a lot of contempt, maybe just rebelling
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   against authority.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.060]   I might want to double check, come alongside my friend to try to find out why are you being
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.160]   so rebellious against authority?
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.040]   Maybe depression.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.720]   Depression can be a result or an evidence because, just think about it for a minute.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.200]   Remember the last time you held a grudge?
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.240]   And I know that you've all done it at least once.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.020]   Do you remember how much energy it took to hold a grudge?
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.440]   How much energy that takes?
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.680]   And that will manifest into depressed feelings.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.800]   It just will when you hold a grudge.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.760]   It's just a lot of emotional energy and it just depletes over time and it spirals.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.160]   And of course, obviously, I'd be remiss if I didn't say that bitterness sometimes is
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.280]   the fruit of unbelief.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.820]   You know, you just might be dealing with a person that just isn't a believer.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:43.440]   You know, you don't know until you spend time with her, until you just ask questions and
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.080]   you try to understand if she knows the gospel very well.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.480]   Not only knows it, but has she truly embraced Jesus as her Lord and Savior?
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.520]   That's really important.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.840]   When I come alongside and help others, counsel others, one of the first things I do is I,
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.320]   aside from asking a lot of questions, we go over the gospel together.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.840]   I really know that there are people that will come in and say, "I've been a believer for
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.840]   20 years."
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.160]   Well, praise the Lord, but we're still going to go through the gospel together.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.680]   I'm sure it'll be a blessing to you.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.640]   Because I want to make sure that she has embraced the gospel and that she knows it.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:23.500]   And you know that like seven times out of ten, people cannot articulate the gospel well.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.920]   And so it just gives me an opportunity to try to help them to understand it a little
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.080]   bit more fully.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.240]   But so that would just be something I would encourage you to do.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.320]   Let's just take a moment to go over the gospel and just see where it is that maybe there's
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.520]   a gap in what you think and believe.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   Okay?
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.800]   Okay, so that's just kind of some evidences, okay?
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.360]   Just to kind of get you thinking a little bit.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.920]   If you were to help somebody, this is some things that you would look for on the surface
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.960]   level, but we have to get a little bit deeper than that.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.360]   So now we're going to look at the heart driving bitterness.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.120]   Why do people get bitter in the first place?
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.880]   What's causing that at a heart level?
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.940]   I mean, it would be wonderful if we could just stop here and just tell our women friends
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.160]   to just stop it.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.520]   Stop being bitter.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.320]   Just stop it, you know, right?
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   I would love it if that were something we could do, you know, and I just want you to
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   be gracious.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.840]   Just be gracious.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.200]   But it's not always that easy.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.480]   So it's important that we look to God's Word and look at a few things.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.440]   So now what I would like you to do is turn to James 4, and we'll just take a little bit
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.520]   of time just to kind of think through that.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:47.320]   James 4, and we're going to look at, let's see, I think I want to do 1 to 3.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.280]   Okay.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:57.880]   So James 4, beginning in verse 1, "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.560]   you?
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.420]   Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.480]   You lust and do not have, so you commit murder.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.680]   You are envious and quarrel, oops, sorry, you are envious and cannot obtain, so you
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.920]   fight and quarrel.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.160]   You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you spend it on
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   your pleasures."
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.760]   Okay?
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:32.960]   So when a person is bitter, it can cause so much conflict in their lives, and a lot of
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.480]   times the root of it, what's happening at the heart level, is it can be traced back
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:44.120]   to a person's desires, you know, what they're desiring, kind of like expectations, you know,
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.660]   what they're expecting.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.600]   Every person has desires.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.800]   We all have them, some good, some bad.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.080]   But here's an example of some good desires.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.720]   How many of you in this audience who are single would like to be married someday?
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.240]   How many?
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.240]   Is that a good desire?
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.680]   What do you think?
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.360]   Is it a good desire to be married?
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.780]   Yes, it's a good desire to be married.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.080]   How many of you, yes, it's a great desire, we're all praying for you, we want you to
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:21.520]   get married, how many of you that are married who don't have children right now, but would
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   like to have a child, or would like to have children, right?
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.160]   Or more children, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.280]   Is that a good desire?
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.340]   It's a great desire.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:40.600]   Children are a blessing, and of course we would want to have that happen and realize,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.520]   what if that good desire goes unmet?
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.280]   You know, it's all in the Lord's timing, right?
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:51.960]   What if that desire goes unmet for a while, for a long time, or maybe not at all?
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   Then what do we do?
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.600]   Do we continue to trust the Lord with that?
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   What do you think?
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:09.120]   Or do we choose to respond in profound disappointment, which leads to bitterness of the soul?
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.080]   Do we continue to find ultimate fulfillment in Christ?
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.380]   Or do we allow these unmet good desires to rule the day, and then eventually grow bitter
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.620]   over it?
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.920]   Some of you might be seniors out here.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.320]   You know, I see this in college students too, where they are panicking because they're a
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:33.520]   senior and they want to do a particular something in their life vocation-wise, or they have
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.880]   a lot of hopes and dreams, and so they have these great desires, but maybe they're not
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.700]   being realized.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:45.160]   And so they're struggling with trusting the Lord, and they're beginning to grow profoundly
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:52.280]   disappointed, and bitterness can pursue that or ensue that.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.700]   But when we do that, when we're not trusting God and we are not finding our ultimate fulfillment
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.560]   in Christ, what happens is this interesting little spiral.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:08.360]   And as you dwell on those things that you think you deserve, those desires, what happens
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:15.040]   is it has the potential to work deeper into your heart, and when this happens, your spiral
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:26.480]   downwards begins to think that it deserves or needs these desires, and eventually you
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.800]   begin to think that if I don't have this good desire, I'm never going to be happy or fulfilled
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   or satisfied.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.920]   And that is what we would say has now manifested into a demand.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.040]   So your desires have now turned into a demand of the heart.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   It was a good desire to begin with, but now it's a demand.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.120]   I think I deserve it.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.040]   And so the dialogue kind of goes like this, just to kind of make it real in a practical
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   way.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.720]   I've heard this before.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:00.440]   I've worked very hard in my job, and I've done everything that my boss has asked me
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   to do.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.440]   I deserve that promotion.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   Okay?
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.240]   Well, there might be some validity to that statement, but what if she doesn't get that
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   promotion?
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   Then what?
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.920]   Does she grow bitter towards her boss, or does she trust the Lord with that decision?
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   He is sovereign.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.880]   You know, there is a reason why he didn't allow that to happen.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.120]   Here's kind of another scenario.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.600]   These are simplistic, but just to kind of get you thinking.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.280]   I've worked very hard this year.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.120]   I deserve to buy that new car, right?
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.800]   But what if your husband says you can't afford it right now?
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.160]   What if he says that you need to wait another year until your finances are in a good place,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   or your parents?
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.840]   It's kind of funny, because I just had this conversation with my youngest daughter.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.440]   She wants to buy a new car, and this is exactly the conversation that we had, come to think
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   of it.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.960]   So, yeah, she forgets when you're 20, you forget that there's insurance involved.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.520]   But anyway, that's another story.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:03.920]   So I told her, for example, her name is Hannah, you'd have to wait.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.640]   I don't think you can afford that, because you're not considering the reality of the
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   situation.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.680]   So does she hold that against me, or does she choose to trust me and trust the Lord
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   through that process?
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.040]   I mean, it's just a car.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.840]   She has a car, but she just thinks she needs a better car, right?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:28.160]   But the point is, is the more we think about something, and the more we want it, the more
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.120]   we succumb to thinking that if only I had this, you fill in the blank yourself.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:37.560]   If only you had whatever that is that just came to your mind, then you would be happy
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.800]   and satisfied and fulfilled.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:45.660]   And when it gets to that point, that good desire again has grown so strong in your life,
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.880]   it's beginning to rule your thoughts, and it's beginning to rule your actions.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.040]   And what do we call that, ladies?
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:58.080]   When something rules us, what's the biblical terminology for that?
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.760]   Say it out loud and proud.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   What?
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.080]   Did someone say "idle"?
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.000]   It becomes an idol in your life.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Martin Luther puts it this way, "To whatever we look for any good thing and refuge in every
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.400]   need, that is what is meant by God.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.920]   To have a God is nothing more than to trust and believe in Him from the heart."
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.640]   And so to whatever you give your heart and to whatever you entrust your being to, that
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.960]   I say is really your God.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.880]   And so that's something to think about.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.560]   Anything that we worship, we're worshippers, right?
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.200]   We're worshiping Christ, but sometimes we worship other things.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.640]   So whatever you're giving your full devotion to, that in that moment is your God.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.880]   And so how can we be good discerners?
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.080]   How can we help our friends?
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.800]   How can we counsel our own hearts?
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.960]   How can we discern whether these good desires that we have have become demands or maybe
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.320]   a functional God in a sense?
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.520]   And I've got some questions on your outline that you can use in your own reflection time,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:06.120]   that you could use to just encourage somebody with if you're having this kind of a dialogue.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:12.240]   Right out of the gate, I would just say, what is it that you're preoccupied with these days?
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.440]   Is this something that's been on your mind morning and night?
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.720]   Is this something you constantly think about?
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.800]   Or how would you finish this sentence?
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.960]   If only I had blank, then I would be fulfilled, happy, and secure, satisfied, that kind of
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   thing.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.440]   Where do you put your trust?
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.040]   When a certain desire is not met, how do you respond?
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:40.700]   Do you respond with frustration, anger, bitterness, depression?
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:45.080]   And is there something that you desire so much that you're willing to hurt others or
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.200]   to sin against others to have it?
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.920]   Those are great questions to ask.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.360]   They're pretty probing, aren't they?
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.720]   Yeah, I'm kind of getting in your grill, right?
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.560]   Yeah, this is biblical counseling.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.720]   That's why it's so different, because I want to get into your life, and I want to help
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.960]   you for those that are off track with Christ to get back on track with serving your Savior
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.760]   with a whole heart, not a divided heart, not a distracted heart, which is something we'll
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.560]   talk a little bit more about in our next talk.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:20.080]   So when good desires go unmet, and we find ourselves frustrated and angry and bitter,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.200]   we can easily fall into the trap of judging others.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.780]   That's kind of the next level.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.880]   And the reason for this is because those unmet desires are failing to be satisfied, and so
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:36.200]   we default to criticizing and nagging and attacking people, just condemning them for
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.880]   not living up to our expectations or even fulfilling those desires.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.960]   And that's sinful, because when you judge people like that, what you're doing is you're
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.400]   presuming upon them and you're questioning their motives.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   And you're not God.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.880]   You can't question people's motives.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.080]   You're to think the best.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.780]   But when we get here, we get kind of just very judging in that sense.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:05.880]   And then unfortunately, when others fail to live up to our expectations or give in to
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.400]   our desires, we simply find ways to hurt or punish other people.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.080]   And all of those evidences we went over already is kind of that form of evidence that I'm
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.480]   talking about, you know, the things that we do.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   We lash out.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.000]   We say hurtful things.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   We inflict pain.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.640]   And really, at the end of the day, it's just a very controlling and manipulative tactic,
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:33.320]   because when you don't give me what I want, you know, I'm going to punish you by imposing
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:38.440]   guilt and shame and saying mean things and things like that, because I want to send a
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.760]   message that I'm not happy, because it's about me, right?
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   Is it about me?
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   Is it about you?
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.360]   No, it's about Christ.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.480]   So some things to think about.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.660]   Desires can easily manifest into demands.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.760]   If we don't deal with that, we can easily turn into a judge of others, which can easily
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.360]   -- we can easily turn into a person who punishes.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.960]   So if that's you, those -- there's some great tools there for you to kind of think about.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:14.160]   And I use James 4 as a way to really filter through my heart.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:19.480]   That is kind of an expanded idea behind James 4.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.160]   So now that we know just a little bit more about unmet desires and how that connects
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.920]   to bitterness, it's really important, once you kind of are working with somebody and
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:32.360]   you're trying to help them understand the heart level, what's going on, what's ruling
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:39.080]   her, it's really important that we just help her to spend time looking to the Lord, right?
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.520]   A lot of the music we sang this morning was so beautiful.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.920]   We have to remind ourselves who we are in Christ, because we can get pretty discouraged
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.320]   if all we did all day long is just focus on our sin.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.140]   We would just feel so wormy all the time.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:59.880]   But it's not just about abandoning or laying aside or repenting of your sin.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.480]   It's also about walking in a manner worthy of your calling.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.980]   That's the full picture.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.180]   And so we kind of need to look at some of those things as well.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.940]   And of course, you know, I always tell people, you know, there's hope.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.820]   There's always hope for a sinner.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:20.440]   That's why I balk at medical models, like when people call themselves alcoholics.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:25.360]   I say, you know, the problem with that is if you call yourself an alcoholic, the world
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.680]   says once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.320]   But if we use biblical language and say that you're a drunkard, there's always hope for
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.380]   a sinner.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.940]   And you can work through that.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.800]   And so I just, you know, try to help people reorient their language, because there is
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.020]   always hope for a person.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.460]   They don't have to stay stuck here.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.380]   You know, this isn't the end.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.860]   They have hope, a lot of hope.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.140]   And we're going to kind of look at that.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.900]   And so what's the first thing that we can give people?
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.820]   We want to always give people ongoing hope.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.760]   That's a big part of biblical counseling.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.380]   How can I give this person ongoing hope?
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:04.060]   The first thing I'm going to tell this woman is God has provided a Savior who has lived
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:09.700]   that perfect life that you should have lived, and who's experienced the punishment that
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.600]   we've all deserved because of our sin and for sin like bitterness.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.280]   And I'm going to remind you that there is always forgiveness in Christ, always, you
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.200]   know, and that's important.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.840]   And so let's kind of work out the root of bitterness with that in mind.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.280]   And so I'm going to encourage her, once we kind of understand what the root issue is
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.640]   here, I'm going to encourage her to repent.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.560]   You guys have heard the word repentance, right?
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.400]   It's not just when we become believers.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:45.320]   That's a grace that God gives us to turn from, you know, our old life to the gospel for salvation.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.600]   But I'm talking about the kind of repentance that's continual.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:54.560]   We should be every day repenting of sin and, or confessing and repenting of sin.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.880]   That's just a continual act that should go on in our life every single day.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:05.000]   And I just gave you something pretty practical there from an old dead guy, Thomas Watson.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.640]   I love the Burgeons.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:13.440]   And this is just really helpful, but he says that, this is like the six practical ingredients
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.120]   for repentance, but he says that first, when we're dealing with sin and repentance, there
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.640]   is a sight of sin.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.680]   In other words, a person must see herself as a sinner and nothing but a sinner.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.520]   So let's be humble.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.200]   You're not perfect.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.040]   We are all sinners saved by grace.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:37.360]   And so we see ourselves this way and we need to acknowledge that we're bitter.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.720]   And we need to acknowledge that ultimately, you know, we're being unforgiving at the heart
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.120]   level and just to kind of give it away, not to beat around the bush, what really is happening
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   here is this person's got a love problem.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.960]   Wouldn't you say, when you're bitter, would you say you have a love problem?
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.880]   We're not loving God with our whole heart, mind and soul.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.000]   We're not loving our neighbor as ourself.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.960]   And those are the two most important commandments in scripture.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.820]   So when you're bitter and you're unforgiving, you've got a love problem.
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:05.820]   You really do.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.440]   It's not getting you any closer to those two goals.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   So just be honest.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.800]   We need to talk to the Lord about these things.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.700]   The second is that there is a sorrow for sin.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.300]   This is not a superficial sorrow.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.800]   This is not, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:28.560]   It's more like I am broken because I have sinned against a holy God, mainly as you're
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.840]   sinning against another person in this way.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.240]   The Puritans call it a holy agony.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.960]   I think I kind of like that.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.420]   Holy agony.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:40.040]   Some other words are just kind of give you a bigger picture.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.680]   But it's like a breaking of heart.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.840]   When you're repentant, just kind of think of your heart being rendered or broken.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.400]   That's what he's, that's the idea that he's trying to give.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.720]   Third, there's a confession of sin.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.160]   Whenever you confess sin, it should always be voluntary.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.320]   The heart must deeply resent it.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.600]   It must be sincere.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.720]   It should be specific.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.320]   And confession of sin should include a resolution never to do it again.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:10.520]   Thankfully, the gal that I'm talking about today, when she became convicted over her
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.480]   sin as we were talking through these issues, she did.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.400]   She got a little overwhelmed.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.240]   You get overwhelmed when you start thinking about these kinds of things.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:24.820]   And she realized that her unwillingness to forgive her husband was just causing a lot
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.140]   of personal heartache.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:30.080]   And so she ended up going to him and talking to him and asking for his forgiveness.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.520]   And that became a witnessing tool anyway, because remember, he's an unbeliever, right?
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.080]   And so she's killing her witness by what she was doing.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.900]   But now she's going to try to win this guy without a word, like 1 Peter talks about.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.740]   And so she confessed her sin, which was just amazing.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.580]   That's how you know that someone's truly repentant.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.560]   They get humble and they want to do these things.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.200]   Then there's a shame for sin.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.720]   You know, your sin should cause a holy bashfulness.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.960]   That's Puritan language.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:04.280]   In other words, you realize that your sin is not just against this person, but ultimately
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.680]   it's against the Lord himself.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:12.340]   That's what David realized when he was convicted over his sin of adultery.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.400]   Then there's a hatred for sin.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.920]   Someone that's truly repentant is what I call a sin loather.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.960]   In other words, they dislike their sin, not only in judgment, but they hate sin in the
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.280]   will of their affections at the heart level.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.680]   And again, Polly realized that as well, and she began to hate her sin.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:36.200]   And then finally, a person turns from their sin.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:41.840]   And as we kind of talked about yesterday, dying to self is really kind of the life of
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.920]   repentance.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:49.840]   You know, you've got to deny yourself in order to continue on with this repentance journey.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.440]   With Polly, she did confess her sin to God.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.380]   She confessed it to her husband, and then eventually they went together to the pastor
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:00.040]   of their church to help them kind of continue.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   You know, I don't know.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.480]   I didn't hear if, in this particular case that I'm thinking of, if the husband got saved,
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.720]   but he was willing to go.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.120]   So some good things could have happened there.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.320]   For you, I would say that even though I'm giving you these little tips from the Puritans,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:18.720]   I think Psalm 51 probably shaped a lot of what Thomas Watson's talking about here.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:25.120]   So I would just encourage you, if you really want to really dive into this issue of repentance,
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.440]   just go to Psalm 51 and read through it.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:36.360]   The context there is David has been, Nathan has basically called him out on his sin of
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:44.160]   adultery and making a situation where Bathsheba's husband got killed in battle.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.680]   And so when he recognizes that, just really quickly, you'll notice in Psalm 51 that he
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:57.080]   goes to God first, that he has a side of sin, he has a genuine sorrow over his sin, he confesses
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:02.520]   it to God with sincerity, and he's ashamed of his sin, and he has a hatred for it, and
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.320]   he just desires to reconcile with God.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:11.680]   And that's largely due to the fact that he has a strong desire to reconcile his relationship
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.880]   with God and has a very strong view of man.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.920]   Okay, so we would talk a little bit about repentance, because that's important, and
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:25.560]   then we would kind of move over to renewing your mind.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:31.480]   Another thing that I would encourage my friend in is I would say, "Look, you know, one of
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:38.240]   the great graces that God gives us to help us identify our sin and ungodly desires will
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.840]   also deliver us from those things in his word."
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.360]   And that's where kind of Hebrews 4.12 comes in.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.720]   It talks about how God's word is living and active.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.120]   It's not just a two-dimensional, you know, piece of literature.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.520]   It's obviously living and active, and when we read it, we feel conviction.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.400]   It's like a double-edged sword, he says.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:03.880]   And so I would just find opportunities to have my friend do some studies in his word.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:09.520]   I had Polly study through the book of Ephesians and just meditate on aspects of it.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.600]   I'd make sure that she's coming to church regularly and sitting under the solid preaching
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.360]   that you all get to enjoy every Sunday, because when you meet with people, you want to make
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.440]   sure that they're listening to the same things you're listening to so you can continue to
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   encourage them in that way.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   That's important.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.480]   Jesus says, too, that, you know, we need to abide in his word.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:35.920]   He calls us to abide in him, and that's just talking about a relationship, being constantly
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:42.400]   aware of our total dependence upon him, because bitterness, in large part, has to do with
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.780]   a self-focus, right?
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.040]   It's all about what I'm dealing with.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.320]   And so you're trying to help a person go from the self-focus to a Christ-focus, and you
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.480]   do that by helping to renew their mind in Scripture.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.680]   Don't use psychologized ways to help people, please.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.680]   Use the word of God.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:02.280]   You've got everything you need here for her life and for godliness.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:06.000]   I would have her think through gospel truths.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   That's important.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.800]   You want to remind people of their position, because, again, people get very discouraged.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.820]   So I would talk through the gospel and all its implications, how it keeps us humble because
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:21.960]   it forces us to admit that we're a sinner in need of God's grace every day.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.280]   I would have them meditate upon gospel truths.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:29.920]   I already mentioned Ephesians 1 to 2 in particular, but I would take her to Colossians 1 to 3
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.920]   as well.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.160]   And I would have a dialogue about the preeminence of Christ.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.080]   I think that would be really encouraging to her.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.040]   I'm sure that your pastor has probably taught on that before.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.200]   I might even do a careful reading of Romans 1 to 11.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:47.520]   That's something I'm actually studying again this year, because I'd want to help people,
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.440]   help her be reminded that she's dead to sin but alive to Christ, and that she's now a
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.680]   slave to righteousness.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.720]   She's not a slave to sin anymore.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.000]   Those are just some really encouraging things.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.200]   And then after that, I might have her just spend some time thinking through Matthew 7,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.840]   which said to have her check her own heart.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:13.120]   You know, Matthew 7 talks about taking the big old log out of your own eye before you,
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.640]   you know, dwell on the speck in your brother's eye.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:22.800]   And I just want her to think through that carefully because maybe in the course of her
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.320]   being bitter, maybe she has something, maybe she needs to take responsibility for something.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:32.000]   Maybe it's not all 100% on the other person's end, right?
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:38.560]   So she might have something she needs to deal with and just confess her sin and all of that.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:44.600]   And the third thing as far as renewing the mind, just have her go to key scripture.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:50.960]   I think key scripture could be like Romans 6, just looking at that whole issue about
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   the old self being crucified with Christ.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.880]   I would take her to Galatians 2.20, which reminds her that she has been crucified with
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:03.480]   Christ so it's no longer she who lives but Christ who lives in her.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.400]   And then after we've kind of dialogued through some of those things, I would then take her
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.120]   to just the put-on aspect.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.680]   I call it reaffirm righteousness.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.640]   That's the next point on your outline.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:22.960]   Going back to Ephesians 4 where we started, remember, we put off bitterness and anger
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:30.040]   and clamor and slander and all of those things, but we put on a heart that is kind and tenderhearted
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.520]   and forgiving.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:36.560]   You know, we've learned that the believer is to put away bitterness, but now we're going
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.320]   to look at what we do next.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.000]   And so as much as we're abandoning all of those other things, putting off that old self
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   and renewing our mind in the scriptures, now we need to step out in faith and we need to
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.120]   actually live like the women were called to be in Christ.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.640]   And what's the first one there?
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.400]   We're called to walk in what?
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   Kindness or tenderheartedness?
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.080]   Or no, kindness is the first one.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.020]   So what does that even mean?
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:06.760]   It just simply means to be gracious to people instead of being harsh.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   That's what that means.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.280]   We are called to be kind.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:15.440]   And when we're kind to others, we're loving people, even if they're the offender.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.280]   We're still called to be kind.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:22.980]   And so when we're extending kindness, we're really just choosing not to say unkind things
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:28.080]   about those who have hurt us and not to be excessively passive either, like withdrawing.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.320]   You know, that's a big part of it as well.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.720]   But instead, we're actively looking.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   I'm helping my friend to actively look for ways to honor the Lord by blessing those who
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.640]   have hurt her.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.880]   And that's how you overcome evil with good.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.380]   Romans 12 at the end there talks about don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.560]   good.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.000]   That's part of being a believer.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.680]   And so this command to be becoming kind is actually in the present middle imperative.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   And so that just means that we're to keep on becoming kind.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.560]   It's something that we're human becomings, you know, this side of heaven.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.880]   We've got to strive towards and continue to do that.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.840]   And the second one is instead of being bitter, we're exhorted to keep on becoming tenderhearted.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.320]   And that just means to have compassion.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.860]   We are to have compassion on others.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.080]   We find the same exhortation in 1 Peter 3, 8 to 9.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.980]   Instead of paying evil for evil, we're to have a unity of mind and we're to be sympathetic
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.860]   and we're to have brotherly love and a tender heart towards others.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:35.940]   In fact, compassion or tenderheartedness, kind of the same word, is the mark of a Christian
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.380]   life.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:42.260]   That's something that we're to have as a fruit of the Spirit.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:45.080]   So how do you extend compassion towards those who hurt you?
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.300]   How do we do that?
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:53.580]   Because sometimes people hurt us so much that to have a compassionate attitude is really,
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.580]   really hard.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.100]   And so, but one thing I can tell you is, you know, you never know.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:03.780]   Your compassion and your kindness towards people that are unlovely, as it were, can
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.340]   be the very thing that wins them to Christ.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.940]   Saw it in my own dad's life, okay?
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:15.960]   When I stopped being bitter towards my father and started realizing he was my mission field,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:21.180]   instead of it being all about me and how he hurt me as a young person, and I started seeing
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:27.440]   him through the eyes of Christ, I was able to change my view.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.020]   And my, it's, you know, you're winning people without a word.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.280]   It's the life that you're living.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.980]   You're being a billboard for the gospel, in a sense.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.820]   And that's what won him over, because I wasn't bitter anymore.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.060]   He saw the change in my life.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.140]   And I also asked him for forgiveness, kind of a thing.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.060]   So that very thing can be the thing that God uses.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.580]   You never know.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:51.040]   And then finally, you know, we're exhorted to be forgiving.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.900]   And so Paul is just talking about that kind of forgiveness that just really bears up with
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.900]   people.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:02.260]   It's the idea of forgiving in the sense of treating the offending party very graciously.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:08.180]   Paul talks about it in Colossians 3.13 as well, that we are to bear with one another,
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.620]   even if someone has a complaint, you're to forgive them.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:15.460]   And you know, Paul knows that the believer's going to offend and hurt one another, but
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:20.260]   what he's urging us to do is just forgive for the sake of maintaining unity in the church.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.460]   And remember I told you yesterday, is the church a building?
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.420]   The church is a body of believers, right?
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:33.220]   And so, you know, we could be talking about this church right now, or we could be talking
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.500]   about your marriages or your friendships.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.380]   So we need to be forgiving people.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.400]   We've been forgiven so much.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.700]   How can we not forgive these little offenses against, that we dwell on so much?
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:54.220]   So in summary, I would just say that the believer is to lay aside the sin of bitterness once
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.500]   and for all, for sure.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.220]   We're called to do that.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:02.040]   And we're also called, though, to continue to walk or to be becoming kind and tenderhearted
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.580]   and forgiving as God in Christ has forgiven us.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.860]   And really the last part of that verse of 32, one thing I want to point out is that,
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.900]   you know, God has in your life once for all forgiven your sins.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.860]   That's what he's talking about there.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.140]   And so maybe that can be your motivator when you start thinking about how much forgiveness
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.540]   has been extended to you.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:26.100]   Could you allow that to motivate you to forgive others from the heart?
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:30.540]   I think it's important to think through.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.260]   So forgiveness is just something that needs to be done in the heart before God.
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.820]   It kind of makes me think of the prodigal son.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.380]   Are you familiar with that parable?
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:44.260]   You know, when you think about the prodigal son in that whole scenario, after that son,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:49.020]   you know, asked for that inheritance and he went away and he squandered that inheritance,
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.740]   that was a horrible thing that he did.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:56.340]   But did you notice in that parable that when he repented and he came back, did you notice
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.860]   that the father was waiting?
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:04.220]   And do you remember also that when he saw his son, he went running towards his son?
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.020]   That's forgiveness.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:12.380]   That is an eager attitude that's ready to extend forgiveness towards another person.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.620]   And that's how we're to be.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.780]   We're to be that kind of forgiving person from the heart instead of being bitter.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   Well you're probably wondering what happened to Polly.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.940]   Did she repent?
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.660]   Did their marriage get, you know, fixed?
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:25.660]   It took a lot of time.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.180]   I mean, these are not like easy things.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.420]   You have to know that you're invested, okay?
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.420]   It takes time.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.780]   I'm not in charge of changing people.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.260]   God does the work and it's a process.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.540]   But once she began that process of repentance, she did begin to respond to her husband in
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:44.420]   a manner that was consistent with who she says she is.
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:48.260]   You know, when scripture talks about walking in a manner worthy of your calling, it means
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.660]   equal weight.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.900]   So who you profess to be needs to be equal with how you live.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.940]   That's the visual.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.700]   And she began to learn how to live in that way.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:06.860]   She began to learn how to abandon her bitterness and be compassionate towards her husband like
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.020]   Christ is compassionate towards us.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:13.260]   And actually, over time, instead of being sort of a victim, because that's kind of how
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:19.560]   she saw herself, of a terrible circumstance, she saw herself as somebody that was able
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.540]   to be like a missionary in a sense.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.980]   She was able to see her husband through the Lord's eyes as a very needy man who just needed
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.980]   Christ.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.620]   And, you know, praise God for the work that he does.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.280]   Praise God for the transforming work that he does in our lives.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.500]   Can you imagine if we had a God that did not work in our lives that way?
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.580]   I mean, we serve a God that we're in relationship with.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.280]   This isn't some faraway deity that is cold.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:52.420]   This is a God that we have a personal relationship with and he will do the work if you will surrender
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.580]   to his will.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:58.980]   Okay, so on that last page there, you've got some resources.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980]   These would be my top four.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:05.700]   Bitterness, the root that pollutes, I already talked to you a little bit about that.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.820]   I just had a counselee just finish reading that more recently, another discouraging marriage,
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.640]   but she got so much out of that resource and she repented.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.860]   Praise the Lord for that.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:21.780]   The second one, unpacking forgiveness, biblical questions and deep wounds by Chris Bronze.
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:26.700]   I think that's the most balanced view I've ever read on the topic of forgiveness.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:32.140]   I would highly encourage you to order that on Amazon or whatever just because it's such
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.700]   an important piece.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:39.780]   From Forgiven to Forgiving, another great book that's not as long as the second one
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.940]   that I just named, but very helpful.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:48.860]   And then the fourth one is just a little booklet entitled Help, I Want to Change, which kind
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:52.580]   of takes you through the put-on process using Ephesians 4.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:55.860]   It's a very balanced view, I think could be super, super helpful.
