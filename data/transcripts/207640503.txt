[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   Well, last week, you know, we had to take a break with all the things that were happening.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.240]   If you will, in terms of the schedule wise, because I know, again, that does affect some
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.640]   of you guys in terms of when you'll be able to attend and stuff, we're going to still
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.300]   end the first week of April.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.360]   So next week, we're just going to double up on the passages.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.880]   So next week's passage is going to be chapter 4, verses 1 through 11.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.640]   So just FYI on the schedule so that you know what's coming up.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.640]   Okay?
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.720]   Well, I want to start off, you know, by saying that you can already tell going through this
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.240]   book, 1 Peter, that there is a lot of repetition.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.080]   Right?
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.840]   So much of it is trying, again, to minister to people who have been hurting.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.880]   So much of the book is trying to constantly give both a rationale, it's both giving an
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.040]   encouragement, it's giving admonition, and it's giving a challenge.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.000]   And we've been saying that in the beginning, he began with this great admonition to remember
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.080]   the salvation that we have.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.600]   But what's more, he's been raising the Christians to a higher standard of God that even in the
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   midst of this kind of suffering, that God desires and calls them to these greater standards
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.000]   of both obedience, holiness, and love.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Okay?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.200]   So in line with that, by way of review, starting from chapter 2, verse 13, he had given a sequence
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.680]   of challenges for those Christians who are experiencing persecution and hardship.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   And perhaps to some of us, that encouragement and challenge was a surprise.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.440]   Because it wasn't just simply, "Hey, you have to persevere."
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.160]   It wasn't simply, "Hey, let's just try to make sure that we last until it ends."
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.240]   But rather, the apostle Peter and God through that had challenged them to say, "I want you
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.660]   to do something that's counterintuitive or even just simply counter-cultural, which is
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.840]   to actually in the heart of hearts, submit.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.940]   To be able to yield.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.320]   And not simply wait underneath that, but actually thrive underneath that with the characteristics
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.880]   of God."
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.760]   And so in chapter 2, verse 13, he called everyone to submit to government and authority.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.320]   Chapter 2, verse 13.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.560]   And then in verse 18, he called the servants to submit to their masters.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.080]   Not only to those who are fair, equitable, and pays you, right?
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.100]   But even to those who are unruly, even to those who are unfair.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.220]   And then he gave in verse 21 this example, because Christ suffered for you in this way,
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.780]   and he left you this example.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.240]   And then the previous two weeks ago, we talked about how even in the home, even when an individual
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.140]   is married to an unbeliever and that unbeliever is being unfair, he says, "Know how to submit
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.420]   to husbands who are disobedient, who are unbelieving."
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.020]   That by your submission, by your character, you're glorifying God.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.460]   And through that, you're revealing who the Father is.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.720]   So with that being said, God has been teaching this high standard that is again, perhaps
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.940]   surprising to us, that is challenging for us, because it goes against the natural inclinations
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.960]   of how we normally operate, okay?
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.440]   So we're gonna dive again deeper into that.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.060]   Let's take a moment to pray, we'll read our passage and then jump in.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.120]   So let's pray together.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.560]   Heavenly Father, we wanna pray that God, your spirit, your Holy Spirit would help us.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.920]   God, we need your spirit that we might be introspective to examine and know ourselves.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.960]   And God, that in our conscience, Lord, we would have clear eyes to see the things that
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.340]   are hurtful and sinful in our lives.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.200]   We also need your spirit to see truth, to see it clearly, and to realize, God, that
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.900]   we need to constantly abide in your word and truth.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.200]   Help us tonight and always, Lord, to constantly receive and apply your word.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.880]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.080]   Okay.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.920]   So I wanna read the passage in its total starting from verse eight.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.980]   So it's a little bit of a longer section.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:46.480]   I'm gonna be reading out of the NASB and it says, "To sum up, all of you be harmonious,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.300]   sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit, not returning evil for evil or
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.040]   insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   For you are called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.240]   For the one who desires life to love and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.140]   his lips from speaking deceit.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.000]   He must turn away from evil and do good.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.440]   He must seek peace and pursue it.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.120]   For the eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous and his ears attend to their prayer.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.880]   But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.240]   Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.280]   But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed and do not
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.440]   fear their intimidation and do not be troubled.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.960]   But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.100]   who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.520]   And keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.740]   revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.920]   For it is better if God should will it so that you suffer for doing what is right rather
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.020]   than for doing what is wrong.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.460]   For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that he might
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.020]   bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.360]   In which also he went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, who once were
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.660]   disobedient when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah during the construction
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.980]   of the ark in which a few, that is eight persons, were brought safely through the water.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.260]   Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you, not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.700]   an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.620]   the right hand of God, having gone into heaven after angels and authorities and powers have
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.820]   been subjected to him.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.340]   Okay.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.500]   Now that passage is a bit long and there's no way we're going to do a thorough, you know,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.140]   phrase by phrase study through the entire thing.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.340]   So I've broke it up into three sections and I hope to give a logical flow and rationale
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.300]   between the three sections that we have.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.980]   Here's the first section.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.100]   Okay.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100]   The first section goes from verses one through 12 and he begins by saying, to sum it up,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.060]   all of you be this, right?
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.620]   Be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, humble in spirit.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.860]   So I left a little parenthetical blank for you there.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.300]   And what I like for you guys to write, whenever you see a section like this, when he's summarizing,
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.500]   obviously that's something for us to take to heart.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.820]   That's something for us to say, I want to encapsulate his teaching and retain this.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.540]   So you have to write emphatic summary command.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.540]   Okay.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.780]   Emphatic summary command.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.700]   And that's where you want to give your attention to and block off sections like that so that
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.220]   you can say, Hey, this, I want to make sure I remember.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.220]   All right.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.460]   Now, as you look at that, we want to talk about this.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.820]   These character traits are actually heart attitudes.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.780]   He expects you to be right.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.540]   There aren't just simple actions for you to do for the guy who's hurting you.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:16.700]   It is a heart attitude and perspective, a condition of even both your emotion, because
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.980]   a lot of those words are emotional.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:26.460]   This kind heartedness, brotherly love, sympathetic, a lot of that happens to be emotional.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.100]   What's more, when you look at those commands, let me ask you a question.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.700]   Do you see a similarity or theme behind those commands?
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.900]   Yeah, I think there is.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:42.700]   When you look at things like harmony, sympathy, brotherly love, kind heartedness, and humility,
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.100]   he is talking about the realm of relationships and the community and the kind of attitude
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:53.300]   he wants you to have is a deep consideration for maintaining that peace within the body
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.900]   of Christ.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.820]   To the degree that when he quotes later on a passage from Isaiah, in that quote he says,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.980]   seek peace and pursue it.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.160]   So immediately there's a challenge for us.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.860]   We know very well that when life is hard, especially when things aren't going right,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.620]   that's when we feel permission to be nasty.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.900]   That's when we feel perhaps an opportunity for us to just lash out.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.500]   That's when we're least patient.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.860]   That's when we're least understanding of other people.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.700]   Rather we expect people to be understanding of us.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.840]   That's when we sin a bunch.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.500]   But in that pressure and in that moment he says, and I want to just run through these
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.380]   things as a way of application for us, he says be harmonious.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.380]   That term literally means to be of the same mind.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.340]   To have the same mind.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.540]   Now if you think about that, it's like so we're supposed to just think the same?
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.260]   If you've ever been in an argument, you know that once you get into an argument, you realize
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.340]   you think differently and then you're doing one of these and the other person's doing
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.660]   one of these and you're communicating and typically when that argument goes sour, somebody
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.340]   says, "Ah, forget it."
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.780]   It's like, "Whoa, I don't want to talk about it."
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   You know?
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.780]   Why?
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.980]   Because trying to understand each other is hard work.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.620]   If you've ever been in an argument, sometimes you feel the frustration where you say, "Hey,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.300]   I don't understand you."
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.940]   And then you don't want to continue the conversation.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.740]   Are you harmonious to the degree where you're seeking to understand that individual even
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.660]   if it's frustrating to you, even if you're fed up, even if you're starting to get like,
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.700]   "Oh, your communication is horrible."
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.380]   But you're seeking that harmony where you can understand what the other person is thinking.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.060]   There's sympathy, right?
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.300]   The idea of carrying each other's burden and feeling the pain of another individual.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.260]   Are you prone to typically sometimes, you know, there was this, you know, in my arrogance,
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.980]   if sometimes you're doing a lot and someone else says like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so busy."
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.260]   And you know, I automatically just be like, "Busy?"
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.260]   You know?
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.660]   "Yeah, right, you're busy."
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.660]   You know?
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.580]   But rather than being sympathetic, yeah, they're experiencing busyness to a certain degree.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.360]   You don't know.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.900]   But are you prone to that kind of, you diminish everybody else's suffering because you feel
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.700]   like your suffering is greater?
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.700]   Or do you sympathize and say, "Man, I feel you."
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.700]   You know?
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.940]   It's hard.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.180]   And you almost want to carry that burden with them because you share that kind of experience
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.300]   with them.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.820]   Is there a brotherly love?
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.420]   The next word is, you know, you guys probably heard the four different terms for love.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.900]   This one is the one that's phileo.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.900]   It's a brotherly love that shows a kind of loyalty, an attachment.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:52.740]   There is kind-heartedness, where an individual who is kind-hearted is tender.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:58.060]   Actually in Ephesians chapter four, that same word is translated tender-hearted, right?
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.820]   Where there is a tenderness of giving mercy, a tenderness of giving compassion.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:10.380]   Now it's not just a simple like, "Aww," you know, every time you see somebody doing something.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.420]   But it's an indication of you have this love to give.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.340]   We are paying careful attention and you have pity on those who are suffering.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.300]   You have care for those who are in need.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.540]   And there is this kind-hearted intention in you.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.380]   And lastly, there is this humility, right?
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.460]   A humility where in moments of suffering, there isn't this, "Look at my scars," you
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.460]   know?
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.220]   I got my little scar right here that Pastor Peter mentioned in the sermon this past Sunday.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.740]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.260]   Whenever you get bumps and bruises, there's a temptation for you to be proud of your scars,
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.620]   you know?
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.860]   And the fact of the matter is, you can.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.140]   You can sit there competing with each other like, "Dude, I earned my stripes.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.140]   What about you?"
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.180]   "Dude, you have no idea what suffering really is."
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.820]   "Dude, X, Y, and Z," you can compete with each other even in the midst and context of
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   suffering.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.500]   That's how pervasive pride is.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:19.860]   Well, I run through these to ask you, do these character traits, do they exist in your heart
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:25.380]   even when, okay, key term here, even when you're under pressure?
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.380]   Even when you're the one suffering too?
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.700]   Even when perhaps you're suffering more than the people around you?
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.180]   And you just don't have that patience for the people who are complaining and whining
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.580]   around you because you feel like you're suffering, but he says, "This is what I want you to
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.340]   do.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.140]   Government's on you, systematic persecution.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.860]   Your boss is on you, unfair treatment, not getting paid what you deserve, et cetera,
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.860]   et cetera.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:55.100]   And even in the arena where you're most vulnerable, your house, even in the arena where you expect
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:01.820]   peace, even in the arena where you expect to be safe, in your home it's not there.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:08.220]   In those times, be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble."
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.220]   That's quite a challenge, isn't it?
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.060]   So every time I'm going through these passages and I keep thinking of this idea like, man,
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.340]   God is just challenging and challenging them to higher standards.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.900]   Not standards that we set for each other and not standards that I think is natural for
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.420]   the situation, but truly ones that are godly.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.400]   And then in the next part in verse nine, he says, "Not returning evil for evil or insult
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.740]   for insult, but giving a blessing instead."
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:44.100]   And I left another parenthetical underlined section, little space there, and I wanted
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.380]   us to kind of get in the habit again of seeing flows of thought.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.420]   So here all you see is just, here's a command, right?
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.100]   Here's a command of, this is what you need to be in your heart.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.700]   And then he says, "But not," right?
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.160]   "Not returning evil for evil."
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.540]   So there is a contrast there.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.580]   And a lot of times when the Bible is giving you something emphatic that he expects really
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.740]   for you to pay attention to, he will do that.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.540]   He'll say, especially when you want to be super clear, "Hey, I needed you to do this,
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.260]   but it's just to make sure you get it.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.460]   Not this, not that, but this."
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.900]   That's exactly how verse eight and nine reads.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.820]   Do this, not this, not that, but this.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.660]   I don't want you to return evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.540]   instead.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.660]   Now that is quite challenging there.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.660]   Why?
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.100]   Because to the Jew, hearing evil for evil, insult for insult, immediately he will think
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.580]   of what's called a lex talionis, which is eye for an eye, tooth for tooth.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.700]   You hit me right here.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.220]   It's coming right back at you.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.900]   And again, that is what's natural.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.020]   So I want you to think about this.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.980]   When was the last time you got in an argument, you got a little angry, and you didn't feel
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.760]   justified to get angry?
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.420]   Every time we get in an argument, of course we feel justified to get angry.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.940]   Every time we get into an argument at some point, it typically starts off with, "Well,
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.260]   because you said this, and because it's your fault, that's why I did what I did."
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.380]   I mean, that's how we normally talk in an argument, right?
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:25.580]   And here, he's saying, "We are so prone that when we receive evil to give evil back, when
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:31.500]   we receive insult to insult back, someone calls you, 'Hey fool, what, you're the fool.'"
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.820]   And our natural reaction is retaliation.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.620]   Our natural reaction is just that, a reaction.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:45.500]   An impulse, fleshly reaction to what we receive, and it just bounces right back.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.860]   But the apostle is challenging us, and this is just kind of crazy to me.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:57.380]   Because when I think about what he's challenging us to do, it would be one thing to say, again,
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.180]   "I know you're being persecuted, and I know people have evil intentions against you, but
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.740]   I want you to be patient and endure."
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.300]   Good, right?
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.420]   That's a good challenge.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.820]   But he's not just telling you to just absorb it, is he?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:18.500]   He is challenging the Christians to when you receive evil and when you receive insult,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:24.020]   not just to stop and hold your ground, but he says, "Rather, return with a blessing."
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.620]   And I'm so convicted by that.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:34.820]   Because he's asking us to go far above and beyond just taking it, rather to turn around
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.960]   and to give a blessing.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.740]   If you guys remember, Matthew chapter 18, verse, well, let's turn over there.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.740]   Matthew chapter 18, okay?
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:54.300]   It's the story about that servant who received grace from his master.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:00.900]   The parable that Jesus was teaching.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.900]   Let's see here.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.900]   Okay.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.780]   I'm going to start reading from verse 23.
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.940]   So Matthew 18, verse 23.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.380]   Jesus is teaching in a parable, and he says this, "For this reason, the kingdom of heaven
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.620]   may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.500]   When he had begun to settle them, one who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him."
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:30.240]   I don't know what the guy did to owe him 10,000, but that's just a lot of money.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.940]   Verse 25, "But since he did not have the means to repay, his Lord commanded him to be sold
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.500]   along with his wife and children and all that he had and repayment to be made.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.120]   So the slave fell to the ground, prostrated himself before him saying, 'Have patience
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   with me and I will repay you everything.'
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.460]   And the Lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.940]   But when that slave went out and found one of the fellow slaves who owed him 100 denarii,
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.780]   when he sees him, he began to choke him saying, 'Pay back what you owe.'
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.140]   So his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him saying, 'Have patience
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.860]   with me and I will repay you.'
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.980]   But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should repay back what
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.120]   was owed.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.860]   So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.460]   to the Lord all that had happened."
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.060]   Now this is the portion I want you guys to pay attention to.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:27.380]   From the perspective of the master, how did he see this slave who perhaps did what was
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.660]   just?
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.900]   Because what was just was he deserves his money.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:41.060]   He says this, "Then summoning him, his Lord said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.540]   you and all that debt because you pleaded with me.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.220]   So do you not also have mercy on your fellow slave in the same way that I have had mercy
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.100]   on you?'
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.780]   And his Lord moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.400]   all that was owed him.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.520]   My heavenly Father will also do the same to you if each of you does not forgive his brother
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.340]   from your heart."
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.480]   Now he is talking about forgiveness.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.940]   He is talking about from brother to brother giving that kind of mercy, right?
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.580]   But it goes in line just with what we're talking about because the attitude of the heart that
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.100]   Apostle Peter expects us to have is one of what?
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.260]   Harmony, sympathy, brotherly love, and kind-hearted compassion.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.900]   And the opposite that he doesn't want us to have is this hardness of heart that wants
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:36.100]   retaliation, rectification, and saying, "You better recognize what you did to me."
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.540]   So here you go, right back at you.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.420]   That is not just a, "Oh, you know, everybody does that."
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.660]   That's not just a, "All of us when we're tired, all of us when we're mad, all of us when we're
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.380]   angry, we do that."
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.700]   According to the other passage, that is a very wicked heart, especially in context,
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:02.180]   especially given the circumstance that you and I have received a blessing.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:08.700]   What's really interesting is in verse 9b, the second half of that, there are successive
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.500]   three fours starting from verse 9b.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.540]   Four, you were called for this very purpose.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.420]   And then verse 10, for the one who desires life, et cetera.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.060]   And then verse 12, for the eyes of the Lord.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:27.100]   And the successive, these verses that come after kind of highlight this idea of why,
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.620]   right?
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:35.580]   Why you should be giving a blessing instead of a return retaliation.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.660]   And he says, "For you were called for this very purpose."
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.060]   And what purpose is that?
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.500]   Were you called for the purpose of just being nice?
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.420]   Were you called for the purpose of making sure everybody has an encouraging time?
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.940]   No.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.980]   He says very interesting, "You were called for the purpose that you might inherit."
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:01.980]   That's you, without working, receiving as an inheritance, something that's free to you,
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.220]   a blessing from God.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.800]   And given that context that you've received that, he says, "You need to give a blessing.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.980]   You cannot just do what everybody else is doing."
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.500]   That's the idea.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.660]   And so he gives this quotation, "For the one who desires life to love and seek good
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.800]   days must keep his tongue from evil, his lips from speaking deceit, and you must turn away
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.460]   from evil and do good."
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.700]   You need to be doing good in the sight of God.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.760]   You need to make sure that before you're right with the other person and demanding justice,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.580]   that you are abiding by the demands of the Father.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.820]   And he says in verse 12, "For the eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous, and his
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.580]   ears attend to their prayer.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.300]   But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.700]   So here's a practical exhortation for you.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.420]   Again, I don't know if you guys have ever been, I don't know, let's say in a heated
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.760]   argument with a family member, like an older brother, sibling.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:09.180]   If you were ever in a really just deadlock argument with a good friend and you guys are
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.580]   all on the verge of breaking your friendship, I don't know if you guys have ever experienced,
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.940]   you know, for those of you guys who are married, of course, you know, at some point or other,
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.340]   maybe you misunderstood your spouse, got into this argument, couldn't understand, and there
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.780]   was no resolve, whatever it may be, you know?
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:34.180]   In that moment, there has to be an intentional break from the natural progression of argumentation.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.140]   There has to be an intentional break of trying to find and pinpoint, it's because you did
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.460]   this and that's why you're at fault.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:48.380]   There has to be a break from whatever your flesh is saying, "I want to win."
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.500]   And two, "I want to do what's good.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.420]   I want to do what's right by God."
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.900]   It's not always just to yield, just to give up and say, "I'm so sorry."
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.900]   You know?
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.220]   If you do that, your spouse can get really frustrated too.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.340]   "You're just saying that!"
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.340]   You know?
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.380]   You need to make sure you're thinking intentionally.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.500]   Right here, right now, I'm not just trying to win, I'm not just trying to overtake this
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.220]   person, I'm not just trying to get the last word in.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.380]   I want to do what's right by God.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.380]   Why?
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.580]   Not because if I do everything by God's way, then everything's going to work out in the
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.460]   end, and they're going to love me, and they're going to do this.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.860]   It might turn out that it keeps perpetuating, but why?
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:32.300]   Because of the grace of God and His good pleasure is upon you when you do good, even in that
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.940]   crisis moment.
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.540]   It's because God's good pleasure is worth it all.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.700]   It's because His countenance, it says, "His eyes are upon those who are seeking this good,
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.980]   even in the moments when it's all bad."
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.980]   Right?
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   That's the idea.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.420]   So I want to challenge you.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.260]   You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:01.020]   When your mind and the flesh starts running in an argument, it's so hard to stop.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.020]   But you have to.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.940]   You have to discipline yourself to learn to do that.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.940]   Okay?
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.540]   All right.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.980]   That was section one.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.980]   So there was a lot.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.340]   Again, we could have stayed there and studied more on that passage, but we're going to move
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.700]   forward.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:26.020]   So verses eight through 12 was a summary command for us to exhibit the character traits that's
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:32.420]   going to maintain the peace and good in your relationships in the community of God.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.620]   Right?
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.140]   And then in verse 13 through 17, let's first read it.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:43.500]   He says, "Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?"
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.300]   And I asked a question, "How could he ask that question?"
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   You know?
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   "Who is there to harm you?"
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.100]   And there might be like all these people, that guy, this guy, this guy, you know?
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:59.460]   And he goes on to say, "But even if you should suffer," so he says, "Even if you should suffer,"
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:06.020]   they are, "for the sake of righteousness," he redefines that and says, "you are blessed."
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   And then he gives another quotation.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.140]   "And do not fear their intimidation.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.840]   Do not be troubled.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.980]   But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.260]   who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.180]   Do it with gentleness and reverence, and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.740]   which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.900]   shame.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.820]   For it is better if God should will it so that you suffer for doing what is right rather
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.980]   than for doing what is wrong."
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.980]   Okay?
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.700]   So, what he's done there is I kind of gave us just a two-part outline.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.820]   Eight to 12 is a summary command.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.380]   This is what you need to be.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.140]   Numbers 13 through 17 is an explanation rationale.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.140]   Okay?
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.180]   A lot of times if you guys have ever been in a teaching moment, whether it's you're
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:04.300]   teaching youth or maybe you're teaching something in a class or whatever it may be, you know
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.060]   that asking questions is a great way to teach.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:13.020]   And asking questions, oftentimes you give a question to teach an important point.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.540]   Well, here, he's got a rhetorical question.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:21.940]   And he's using that by means of explaining and redefining what they perceive to be the
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.940]   reality.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.300]   They're thinking, "Oh my goodness, we're suffering.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.700]   Is God against us?
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   Has he left us?"
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.740]   I mean, all these questions perhaps, you know, is pervading their minds.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.140]   And that's why chapter one, he went at such length to say, "No, God has blessed you.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.820]   He has blessed you thoroughly and he's been working and he's chosen you."
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   Right?
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:46.220]   Well, here he asks this question, "Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.580]   what is good?"
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:56.100]   Now throughout this whole segment from chapter two, verses 13 and all the way, you're going
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:03.180]   to see that all the way to chapter four, verses 11, he's going to constantly repeat this idea.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.980]   In this circumstance, do good, do good.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.500]   So it almost carries a command.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.940]   Make sure that you're zealous for good.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:17.500]   And by asking this question, he pretty much, you know, kind of states this case.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.860]   Typically speaking, as you're seeking the good and seeking not simply your own ambition,
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.900]   not simply seeking your own security, not simply seeking your own ends.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.940]   When you're seeking what's good, peaceable, and all the things that he listed, who is
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.740]   there to harm you?
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.380]   That's typically what he's asking, right?
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:43.100]   But by contrast, so the rhetorical question, he kind of gives this explanation that regardless
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.660]   of circumstance, you need to be zealous for doing what is good.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.940]   And typically, typically people aren't going to harm you for that.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:58.940]   But in contrast, even if you should suffer, you are blessed.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.040]   And he gives this encouragement.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.300]   He gives this, I guess, redefinition of reality.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:09.580]   That even in the midst of suffering, they're actually blessed by God, right?
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:17.620]   Now I want to kind of get to the middle section, the second half of verse 14 and verse 16,
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:24.540]   by way of the explanation, by way of the encouragement, by way of admonition, right?
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:30.060]   Typically the hurdle that arises for when we're trying to do good are the things that
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.900]   he addresses here.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:37.180]   First he starts off with by saying, "Do not fear their intimidation and do not be troubled."
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:42.260]   There's a quotation from Isaiah chapter eight, I'm just going to read it for us, verses 12
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.260]   through 13.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   This is where that passage is from, Isaiah chapter eight, verses 12 through 13.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:55.660]   Isaiah says to King Ahaz, "Do not cause conspiracy, all that this people cause conspiracy, and
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.100]   do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.300]   But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.140]   Let him be your fear and let him be your dread."
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.140]   Okay?
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   All right.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:14.900]   So as I kind of explain this a little bit, I'm going to try to make sense of verse 13
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   and then all of this.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900]   Okay, here we go.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.140]   A little bit of context about that passage in Isaiah.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:27.540]   King Ahaz in his situation, he is king of Judah, southern kingdom.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:34.220]   The Assyrians who are vicious, huge nation, overthrowing many kingdoms around the known
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.340]   region, the known world, is coming down.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.580]   There is imminent doom.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.340]   So northern kingdom says, "Hey you guys, they're not necessarily, they've already split.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.460]   They don't have a good relationship."
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:50.900]   But they say, "Let's make an alliance with the Assyrians, with Israelites, with Judah,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.100]   and then we can fight the Assyrians."
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.340]   And then King Ahaz says, "Forget you.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.260]   I don't want to team up with you."
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:03.700]   So what he does is he sends word and makes an alliance with the Assyrians themselves
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.940]   and he makes this pact.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.620]   To that Isaiah is thinking, "Oh my goodness, are you serious?
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.660]   Why are you acting like those individuals who have no God?
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.380]   They have wood, they have stone, they don't have a God.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.380]   You have God.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.940]   Why are you making an alliance with them?
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.940]   They're nothing."
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.940]   Right?
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.940]   They're nothing.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.540]   They have no God.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.860]   They're nothing.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:35.300]   So the challenge here is, rather than fearing them, rather than being intimidated by them,
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.020]   whom shall you fear?
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.300]   You should sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.340]   So now that question, who is there to harm you, starts to make sense.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.140]   You might be sitting there thinking, "Who's there to harm you?
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   All these guys.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:55.460]   The kings, the governors, the people, my boss, everybody, even my husband.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.020]   They're nobody compared to Christ."
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.860]   In the Gospel of Matthew chapter 10, Jesus himself says to the disciples, "When you go
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.220]   out you're going to be persecuted to the degree," and he gives that description, "There's going
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   to be a sword.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.220]   There's going to be division.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.620]   There's going to be all these people who despise you."
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.580]   But fear not those individuals who only can harm the body.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.580]   Fear him who can what?
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.740]   Destroy both body and soul.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.180]   Who is there to harm you really?
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.700]   Just these people.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.700]   And that's it.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.900]   But rather the challenge for us, and this is the main point of section number two, the
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:38.380]   rationale behind the command, why you should, in the moment when your natural flesh is trying
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.380]   to fight back and you've taken taekwondo since we were young and you have always learned
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.380]   to defend yourself.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.540]   Nowadays it's all that crazy stuff.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.460]   MMA, the crazy stuff.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.380]   You have, what is it called?
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.380]   There you go.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   You guys know that.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.380]   That stuff is crazy.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.020]   You're going to kill somebody with that.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.300]   You've always learned to defend yourself and what's natural to you since you've been taught
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.460]   when you're young is, yeah, if somebody tries to punch you, hurt them back.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.100]   Why should you now obey a higher standard?
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.100]   Why?
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.780]   Because it's Christ, the Lord whom you sanctified in your heart that even in that moment when
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:17.500]   your rationale is saying, "Fight back, fight back," you have a much greater voice to listen
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.940]   to.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.500]   So here's a challenge for us.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.340]   Here is an encouragement.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:30.140]   Here's a rationale of why you need to do these things that Apostle Peter is saying.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.340]   Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.140]   What does that even mean?
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.540]   You guys know the typical definition of sanctify.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.660]   If I sanctify this, I set it apart.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:47.620]   So does it simply mean, does it simply mean to value him?
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.620]   I want to be dedicated to Christ.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.340]   I want to make sure he's the most valuable thing in my greatest allegiance.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.180]   Yes, that's true.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.100]   But do you guys remember the disciples' prayer?
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.900]   I like to call it the disciples' prayer.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.660]   I learned that from our professor in seminary, Dr. Harris.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.620]   Because although it's the Lord's prayer, he's teaching the disciples how to pray.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:14.460]   And it's our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.580]   Now we're never ever going to change that prayer.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:25.060]   But that word for hallowed be thy name, hallowed, in the Greek is the same word here as sanctify
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.580]   Christ.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:33.340]   We need to regard Christ with an incredible amount of reverence, where we are giving consideration
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.780]   and thought to him.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.840]   What does my Savior Jesus Christ think of me in this moment?
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.100]   And you need to set him apart as Lord over your life.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.300]   You need to set him apart both Lord over your heart in terms of both what you are thinking,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.340]   feeling, and then therefore going to do.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.820]   That's what we're talking about here.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.460]   That Christ needs to be set apart and hallowed in the same way that God himself was hallowed
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.260]   in our lives by the way that we behave, by the way that we react, by everything that
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:09.420]   we're doing that we're acknowledging him as a king over our lives.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:15.700]   So right now I'm using a lot of analogy of conflict and strife.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:22.660]   In moments of conflict, before you make any demands that somebody, somebody should pay,
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:28.140]   that somebody should make things right, that somebody to do right by you, remember before
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:34.380]   you make any demands that God has a demand of you, before you think to enact justice
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:39.100]   on somebody else, remember God is going to start with you.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:44.460]   That his justice come first and whatever demand and expectation you have of the people, that
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.820]   takes a far, far second place.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   That's the rationale.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.340]   Yes, you're given the circumstance where it's difficult.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:01.300]   Yes, the people around you might be overbearing, pressing you, but even in that moment, you
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.820]   have a calling of the Lord that you need to abide by.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.060]   So as a challenge to us, I'm going to, for our memory verse, this is going to be our
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:17.340]   memory verse, verse 15, to sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts, always being ready
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:24.300]   to make a defense to everyone who asks you, why are you operating by this crazy high standard
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   here?
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   What is causing you to do something that's so natural?
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:34.580]   And you're going to be able to say, because I have set Christ as Lord in my life.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.580]   So that's section two, okay?
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.460]   The rationale.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:43.020]   So we have the first section, summary and command, second section, verses 13 through
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:49.060]   17, the rationale and the exhortation for us, that Christ takes that place of Lordship
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.660]   over us.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:59.300]   And then we have this last section, verses 18 down to verse 22, which is a crazy one.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   And if you guys have thoughts about it, I want you to share.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:08.620]   Verse 18, for Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:14.580]   he might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.980]   spirit.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:22.820]   And then verse 19, in which, also he went and made proclamation to the spirits now in
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.320]   prison who once were disobedient when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.420]   Noah during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is eight persons, were brought
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.820]   safely through the water.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.900]   And then verse 21, corresponding to that, baptism now saves you, not the removal of
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.940]   dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience, to the resurrection
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.540]   of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven after angels
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.820]   and authorities and powers have been subjected to him.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.060]   Okay.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:00.620]   As we read that, if you just kind of read it, and then you're trying to just think about
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.920]   it, you're just going to be like, what?
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.100]   How does this even fit?
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.420]   So I want you to think about that.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:12.460]   He's talked about, okay, Christ has died and his sacrifice, you know, was the just for
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.460]   the unjust.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.460]   I get that.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.460]   I believe it.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.460]   Amen.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.460]   That is the gospel.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.300]   And he talks about how he went to make proclamation in the spirit.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   He brings up Noah.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:27.020]   He brings up, you know, the patience of God's waiting and all these disobedient people are
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.580]   the people that are in prison.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.900]   What is that all for?
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:38.740]   So in the section heading, if you, if I were to make just an outline, I would just make
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.740]   an outline.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.620]   I'm making a broad outline.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:47.580]   You have section versus eight through 12 summary command versus 13 through 17 rationale.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:54.180]   And this section, it begins with four, which is typically like a, because, but actually
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:59.740]   in this case, it's more of a, as in this case, meaning example.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.700]   So in the blank that I've provided you, you should put something to the extent of, and
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   the example for us to follow, right?
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.900]   The example that will encourage us.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.740]   You've been given the command, you've been given an explanation of why and et cetera,
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:21.420]   but here is the example further giving you that push so that you can receive this teaching.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.500]   Right?
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.620]   And why do I say this as an example?
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.180]   Because reading in context is always good.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:32.140]   If you take a look at your Bibles and you go to first Peter chapter four, verses one,
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.260]   look at what he says.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.360]   It's just, it's a, it's a running thought.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.220]   It doesn't just stop there, but he says, therefore, look at this, since Christ has suffered in
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:47.020]   the flesh, then arm yourselves also with this same purpose because he who has suffered in
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.900]   the flesh has ceased from sin.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:54.140]   So actually this idea of suffering and it says idea of purpose of that suffering is
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.220]   all still tied in.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:00.360]   And then he says, since therefore you need to arm yourselves with that same purpose.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.540]   So you see what I'm saying by, I think this is him saying, look at this example that he's
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:10.620]   given you in this case with what Jesus has done.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:15.280]   That's going to encourage you to keep obeying what is hard, which is to exhibit this kind
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.740]   of kindness and harmony and this composure even in the midst of persecution.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.880]   Right?
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.140]   So let's take a look at that a little bit.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.700]   First in verse 18 he says for Christ also died and this part, I'm just going to read
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.060]   like a running commentary and then get to an emphatic point.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.620]   He says Christ also died for sins once for all the just for the unjust so that he might
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.000]   bring us to God having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the spirit.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.460]   If you take a moment to stop there, he is still drawing our attention just like he did
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:55.860]   in chapter two verse 21 I don't want you to forget if you're still feeling emotion like
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.660]   Oh, I'm so like my life is so hard.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.660]   Where is God?
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.660]   Has he left me?
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.660]   Is he against me?
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.860]   But Christ also suffered and God loved Jesus Christ.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.000]   He was well pleased with Jesus Christ.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.860]   So it doesn't just go to say as an encouragement to you just because life is hard, that does
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.940]   not mean God has forgotten you.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.940]   No way.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.940]   Right?
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.660]   As a matter of fact, he can be showing his love on you.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.500]   He could be guiding you, teaching you, disciplining you, waking you up, whatever it may be.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.140]   It could be a plethora of things, but he has not forgotten you just because things aren't
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   going right.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:37.460]   As a matter of fact, and he's thinking here, look at all the injustice wrapped up in this
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.860]   short little verse.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.740]   He died.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.540]   He died for sins.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.020]   Those weren't his sins.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.540]   It was the just for the unjust.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:57.660]   It was he who was inculpable, sinless for those who were culprits, for those who are
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.860]   unjust so that he might bring what?
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.420]   He might bring us successfully to the Father.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:07.460]   And he says, "Having put to death and the flesh the mouth made alive in the spirit."
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.740]   You think about all this and think about the injustice and the things that were suffered
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.580]   by our Savior.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.720]   When he was put on trial, even his trial was unjust.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:24.460]   When he was mocked, when he was beaten, when he was spat upon, everything was so magnanimously
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.460]   unjust.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.460]   Okay?
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:31.820]   So as we think about that, he's constantly bringing our attention back to this idea,
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.580]   Christ suffered also.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.500]   Don't you forget it.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.700]   Okay?
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.340]   But as we think about this, remember, this is an example that's supposed to somehow encourage
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.340]   us.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.340]   Okay?
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.600]   That part completely makes sense.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.500]   I'm going through certain sufferings.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.860]   Jesus went through suffering far beyond what I can imagine.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.720]   I'm going through suffering, some of which I deserve.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.220]   Jesus deserved none of it.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.260]   It makes sense now.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.380]   Just knowing, or at least just knowing that, you know, these things are still in the plan
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.380]   of God.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:11.700]   But in verse 19, the example goes further to describe, he says, "In which also he went
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:16.100]   and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, and who once were disobedient, when
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.540]   the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark,
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.140]   in which a few," that is eight persons, "were brought safely through the water."
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.140]   Okay.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:31.340]   Now, as we're looking at this, I'm going to take a little detour.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.260]   Okay?
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.460]   This little passage has elicited a lot of debate and a lot of questions.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.500]   Namely, what is he talking about?
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.700]   Namely, who are these spirits?
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:50.460]   Did Jesus, when he died, died, sorry, when he died, grammar, when he died, did he go
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.260]   to like the abyss?
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:57.860]   Did he go to hell and like preach to demons or dead people, or what did he do?
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:03.220]   Now, there's a lot of research that can be done, and for the sake of our own Bible study,
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.980]   I'm just going to say that there are various views, which I will summarize now, but I'm
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.300]   not going to get into every single one.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.500]   If you are interested, you can do research, and I'm going to post up in that drop box
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.340]   articles that you can follow.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.340]   Okay?
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.540]   But here's view number one, which I've listed for you there.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:26.100]   View number one is, hey, there's nothing crazy supernatural going on here, except that any
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:33.760]   time there is a preaching going on by prophets, by apostles, the spirit of Christ is there.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:40.060]   So view number one essentially says is, in spirit, Noah preached, and Christ was spiritually
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.020]   preaching through Noah.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.740]   And as he preached, people were disobedient, and because they were disobedient, they went
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.740]   to hell.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.740]   That's it.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.100]   There was nothing crazy about that.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.100]   Okay?
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:58.580]   Now, that view has some grounds, because again, yes, when Jesus says in the Great Commission,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.740]   "Preach, go make disciples, lo I'm with you," when you preach, you got to believe Jesus'
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.500]   presence is there.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.140]   And as a matter of fact, other passages that talk mainly about everything about the Old
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.380]   Testament would talk constantly, refer to the fact that this was Jesus, that was Jesus,
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.740]   and so was the presence of Christ there in the Old Testament as the preaching was going
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.740]   on.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.740]   Yes.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:24.820]   But unfortunately, that view doesn't take into account some of the other details about
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:30.340]   this passage specifically, and it doesn't take into account the fact that other passages
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:37.940]   in the Bible, namely like 2 Peter and the letter of Jude, it references the same incident
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:44.420]   with Noah and the people who were disobedient, and which God particularly saw as wicked.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.420]   Okay?
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:52.580]   So, view number two is, in his bodily death, Jesus spiritually went to prison, which is
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:58.140]   called the pit of abyss in Revelations, to proclaim victory, not the gospel, between
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.260]   the three days before his resurrection.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.260]   Okay?
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:06.700]   So, that view simply says, no, like he literally went to some place spiritually, which is the
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.660]   abyss, and he preached.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.820]   And what he preached was victory.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:17.380]   But in view number three, it's same as number two, but it expands to say that not only did
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:22.740]   Jesus just simply go, but specifically in the time of Noah, there were these spirits,
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:28.900]   these demons who were particularly wicked and vicious in the eyes of God, namely Genesis
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:35.180]   chapter six, when it says that in that time of Noah, there were sons of God who came down
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:39.220]   and they saw the daughters of men, they saw what they liked, they saw they were beautiful,
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.060]   and they had sexual relations with them.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:47.860]   And then it talks about how these individuals were wicked in the eyes of God, and then God
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.560]   felt the need to eradicate that generation.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:58.220]   And so many people believe that that generation was like a half-breed, a demonic breed, and
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:05.580]   that generation was demonized by these disobedient individuals who left their abode and did that
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.980]   crazy thing.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   Okay?
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.460]   So those are some of the popular views.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.060]   Any questions about that?
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.060]   Good, because I got no answers.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.260]   I'm just kidding.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.980]   If you're curious, I'm going to post up a bunch of research articles and stuff, just
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.980]   don't have time to go over all that stuff now.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.540]   But I wanted to address that because that's where a lot of people's attention goes to,
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.060]   but I want to come back to this idea.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:36.820]   But that's weird, because this is supposed to somehow encourage us to obey.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.460]   This is supposed to somehow encourage you to persevere in the midst of suffering, to
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.780]   still hold your composure, be peaceable, be hopeful, be so secure that you could bless
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.740]   somebody even when you're being hurt.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.660]   How does that even work?
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.660]   Right?
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:58.300]   Well, let's observe what we know from this passage.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.660]   Here are some of the things that we know.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:05.460]   During the time of Noah, clearly there was some kind of vicious disobedience.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.500]   So specifically, was it demons?
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.180]   Specifically, was it all just people being nasty?
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.580]   I don't know the exact details, but it was heinous.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.020]   It was disobedience, and God was incredibly upset and angered by that.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.060]   But the patience of God was there.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:28.080]   Now, because God was patient, for that time being, guess what?
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.020]   Noah and his family suffered.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.580]   They suffered ridicule.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.060]   They suffered great toil.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.260]   They had to build.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.340]   They had to X, Y, and Z.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:43.140]   Realize that because of the patience of God in this generation, you have to suffer.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:48.740]   If we desire for us to say, "God, remove this suffering right now," you got to realize
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.660]   that that's also saying, "God, stop being patient.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.220]   I want you to enact justice right now."
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:59.180]   I'm not sure if you guys ever thought about it that way, but the patience of God entails
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.460]   that the people of God bear alongside God.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.460]   Does that make sense?
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:12.380]   Secondly, you notice that he's talking about this idea that Christ suffered, but after
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.660]   that suffering, there was this proclamation.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.820]   And so the thing that you should be thinking about is triumph.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.980]   The concept that should be entering your mind isn't like, "Who are these demons?
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.980]   Who are these spirits?"
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:28.060]   What you should be thinking is victory.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.980]   Through that which Christ suffered, it wasn't just he suffered, and then life goes on.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.540]   Ta-da, ta-da, whatever will be, whatever be.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.260]   And sometimes whatever will be includes hardship.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.420]   That's the way that some people think about existential Christianity, which is life sometimes
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.120]   is horrible, but you just got to be Christian anyway.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.540]   That's not what the gospel is trying to teach us.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.620]   That even the suffering that we experience is very purposeful, is very intentional, and
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.300]   Christ at the end of that is giving victory by what he's proclaiming to all those who
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.820]   would oppose the gospel, "Look what I have done."
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.380]   And in that, we too have victory as well.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.860]   That there is the encouragement.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.660]   That there is the challenge.
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.460]   You think about the days of Noah and how many people, I mean talk about standing against
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:20.260]   the grain, how many people actually entered that ark and survived?
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   Eight.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:26.460]   So for you, if you feel like you're alone, if you feel like there's nobody with you,
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:30.140]   if you feel like the world is against me, if you feel like the suffering is so immense,
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:35.580]   if you feel like the suffering is so long, remember this story.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.340]   Remember this story.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:43.420]   My expectation was that if you try to live a life of godliness, you many days will feel
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:44.420]   alone.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.380]   I mean think about this even for a little bit.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:52.700]   If you so desire to take everything in the scripture seriously, and you stopped doing
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.180]   things like the rest of the world, so not only just worship, scripture says don't worship
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.940]   like the world, but do you realize scripture also says basically don't party like the
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.940]   world?
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.340]   Don't hope like the world, don't grieve like the world, don't even eat like the world.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:09.300]   Your every single thing is going to be different because of your savior.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:13.860]   When you do that, in this generation here in America, even amongst Christians you'll
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.540]   feel isolated.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:21.580]   Even amongst Christians you'll feel a sense of like hmm, there's not, I don't know, it's
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.940]   not everybody.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:28.220]   But the fact of the matter is, scripture has already given us warning.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.940]   Scripture has given us expectation, right?
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.460]   Super wide is the gate, and super narrow is this one.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:42.300]   But if our expectation was like, but I wanted to do this and I wanted to do that, this is
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.480]   where we need to constantly change how we perceive life to be.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.780]   And then in verse 20 to 22, this is what he talks about, that Jesus Christ through the
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:55.300]   resurrection who is now seated at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven after
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:52:00.020]   angels and authorities and powers have been subjected to him.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.580]   Current circumstance.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.140]   Satan is not all powerful, he's not omniscient, and he is not free.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.420]   Did you know that?
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:13.020]   Yes, does Satan roam around like a lion and all that kind of stuff, waiting to try to
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.940]   snatch and try to take the seed?
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:20.260]   Yes, but he is still completely underneath the sovereignty of Christ.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.740]   I mean just think about all the stories of Christ.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:29.820]   You get out, you out, and then everyone's just like, wah, pigs, and die, you know?
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:35.500]   At the very word of Christ, demons shudder.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.620]   That's an encouragement.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.980]   Christ proclaims victory to the spirits.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:47.500]   And should they feel like the world is crumbling and the dark forces of the world is winning,
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.140]   Apostle Peter is saying, look at the actual reality spiritually.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:54.500]   That's not the case at all.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:53:00.860]   So by way of challenge, he's given this exhortation in this specific event of the case of Noah,
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.420]   which there's a lot of questions still.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.580]   There's a lot of questions still.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:12.100]   But I think what that tells me is no matter the scheme, no matter the attempt, no matter
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:19.140]   the strength, no matter the numbers, even if Satan threw all that he had, Christ is
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.420]   still powerful, amen?
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.700]   Christ is still victorious.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:26.940]   He is still triumphant, and that's what we've got to believe.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:32.940]   Now by way of conclusion, every time I'm preparing a lesson in 1 Peter, and I, you know, like
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.060]   the whole idea with sermon prep is first I got to see, like, I always ask myself, what's
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.660]   my personal fallen condition in all this?
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:44.220]   You know, like I asked myself the question, like, hmm, how do I respond to suffering?
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.220]   How do I, and I'm going to be 100% honest with you, half the time I'm sitting there
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.060]   thinking my life is really good.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.180]   I mean, at max, I might be, I don't know.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.620]   Honestly, my life is really good.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:01.620]   Like I don't have crazy people trying to kill me.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.420]   I don't have people stripping me of my goods and property.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.460]   I don't have the risk of losing my wife.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:11.580]   I don't have the risk of having to lose my home, run away, be a refugee, but these people
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.940]   had their families broken, their children ripped away from them, their property confiscated,
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:21.660]   and they're run out of their home, and they're now scattered across Asia.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:28.140]   So half of me always sitting here as I prepare these passages, like, man, how do I apply
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.140]   this stuff?
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.600]   I'm going to be honest, we're very well protected here, you know?
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:40.180]   And we have to remember, we really are a minority in all the world.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.500]   To live in this kind of security, this kind of comfort, we're insulated with like a layer
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.540]   of protection, you know?
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.740]   And the fact of the matter is, yeah, we can freely worship, and I know some of us, especially
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:55.460]   in this time, are thinking like, but the liberals are coming, and they're getting pervading
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:00.620]   into everything from education to this and churches, and we got to get America back,
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.140]   you know?
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:06.500]   Honestly speaking, we have it so good.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:12.140]   We have it so good, and even statistically speaking, I mean, we have it the best.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:17.960]   I mean, we're literally the minority, like 2% of all the world, of the 7 billion people
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.400]   that exist.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.120]   We have great freedom.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:29.100]   So as I think about that, I want to conclude, as we hear these admonitions for us, first,
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.420]   let's be incredibly grateful.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:38.700]   Let's be so thankful that Christ is my Savior, that He has had victory, and He's guiding
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:45.840]   me to be something greater than my flesh wants to bound me to, right?
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   Let's give thanks.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   Even if we're not suffering, even if we're not being persecuted, let's make our hearts
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:57.300]   so grateful and continue to sanctify Christ in our hearts and say, "Thank you that you
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.860]   are my Lord."
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.900]   And I get to worship you as Lord freely.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:09.340]   But number two, let's prepare for future suffering and never assume and never presume that God
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:14.980]   will make tomorrow exactly as it's happened today, right?
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.260]   Let's prepare for things to come.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:22.340]   Let's make sure that we won't be surprised as Apostle Peter would say, "Don't be surprised.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.180]   Don't sit there shaking your head like, 'What's going on?
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.180]   Why?
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.540]   What's God doing?'"
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.460]   I think Apostle Peter would say, "Man, I've gone through several chapters trying to explain
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.660]   to you what's going on.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   This world will never accept you as their own.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:39.780]   Never.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.300]   Never accept you as your own."
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   But number three, and this is a challenge, we have the freedom to be like hardship-free,
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.780]   but let's take upon the hardship of others.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:59.380]   Let's take upon the burden of others.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:04.820]   Let's take upon the burden of loving an individual to go and speak to them the gospel and see
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:11.220]   that as a burden I will voluntarily carry, for that is the great example of Jesus Christ.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:17.620]   It was the just for the unjust, but it was the just voluntarily taking the unjust pain.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:23.300]   It was the righteous voluntarily taking the burden and suffering that he did not deserve,
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.700]   but rather we deserved.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:29.180]   That was not something circumstantially he just had to go through.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.900]   He took that upon himself.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.220]   And so for us, we can do the same.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.460]   That in our gospel preaching and ministering to others, we just assume if I try to get
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:45.060]   involved in your life, I'm going to get hurt, but I want to.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:52.660]   My Savior did so and he's given me love in my heart for you and I've got love to give.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.580]   That's the way we should be thinking, especially if we're blessed, that we would take upon
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:04.860]   the burden and we would take upon the suffering and when he calls us to be harmonious, sympathetic,
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:09.820]   you know, to bear along with side people, that's what he's calling us to do.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:15.300]   So for a generation who have been privileged and given much, I believe Christ will also
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.700]   expect much of us as well.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:25.180]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.380]   Heavenly Father, we do want to thank you.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:33.460]   God, we thank you so much that you had pity on us, that you had mercy on us, and that
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.180]   you desire to help us.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:42.620]   That in our feeble and weak and helpless state, Lord, that you condescend to us.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:49.940]   Lord God, I pray that if we have a worldview that is not in line with Scripture, if we
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:57.340]   have a worldview that has been so bordered up by this world and constructed out of, you
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:03.180]   know, fantasies that we've learned from the world, I pray God that you would take those
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:09.660]   things and put them away and give us, Lord, just the expectation that in this life we
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:14.380]   will go through much suffering and difficulty, but there that, Lord, that we are waiting
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:19.500]   such a reward, that we're waiting such an inheritance to be found in Christ our Savior.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.820]   Lord, I ask that you would challenge every single one of us, that God, we would be ministers
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:29.260]   of the gospel to people around us, Lord, that we would never simply be content of being
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:34.140]   safe but rather, God, that we would take upon your call for us to be a light, that we would
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:39.220]   proclaim the excellencies of him who's given us such grace.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.820]   And Lord, if there's anyone here feeling this need to continue to follow after you, would
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.460]   you give them that conviction in their heart through the Spirit, Lord, that you have called
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:51.660]   us first and foremost in this life to be a great light to your gospel.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.740]   Lord, we thank you it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:59.860]   Okay, before we wrap up the study, is there any questions?
