[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.960]   >> Majority of the stuff that's
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.400]   on the Q&A here was answered in the first.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.780]   And so I'm not sure if I need to answer all that
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.740]   because the questions that came in,
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.680]   for the most part, was for the first.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.840]   So I'm just going to show the questions.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.440]   And then we'll see.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.620]   Maybe this -- and then there's some questions that came
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.420]   out of you guys, and I'll definitely try to cover that.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.640]   Okay? And then if you have any questions beyond that,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.540]   because this is a smaller group, and if you want to deal
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.560]   with that, we'll try to deal with that.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.260]   So some of the stuff I'm just going to skip
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.640]   because it was relevant to them.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.800]   It might be relevant to you, so if you want me to address it,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.540]   I'll try to address it.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.780]   Otherwise, we'll just move on.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.640]   Okay? Then afterwards, I'll just --
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.100]   you know, I told the first group that I'll give
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.140]   about 10 minutes to open questions,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.860]   and ran out of time.
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.820]   So I'm going to try to do that here, but no guarantee.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.200]   I'm going to try to do that.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.640]   All right.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.780]   Let me pray for some stuff.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.900]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this opportunity,
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.300]   and we pray that you will bless this time so that the things
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.100]   that we discuss and try to answer, Lord God,
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.540]   would come from you, not from my thoughts,
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.040]   but that your word be expressed according
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.940]   to your purpose and will.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.580]   We thank you, Father Jesus, and we pray.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.640]   Amen. Okay.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.440]   The majority of this stuff is not for this group,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.500]   but let me just do it anyway.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.320]   Okay. We are Southern Baptist.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.860]   Anybody have questions about that?
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.520]   Okay. Just to give you a quick overview,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.160]   the way Southern Baptist is organized,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.800]   it is local church autonomy,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.220]   meaning that we don't have a governing board outside
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.960]   of our church that we submit to.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.260]   It is completely voluntary.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.860]   Okay. Where are we going?
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.980]   We're going to record this, too.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.820]   >> We're really close.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.300]   We're really close.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.000]   >> I'm going to mess you up.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.300]   I'm going to --
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.500]   >> Can you go back one?
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.080]   Go back one.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.660]   >> All right.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.420]   All right.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.920]   That's good.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.320]   All right.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.900]   So because it's local church autonomy,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.940]   it's basically voluntary.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.060]   So we support the local chapter of the Southern Baptist,
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.160]   so we give an offering about $200 a month, and they use
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.980]   that to help plant like-minded churches.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.300]   So we've been Southern Baptist from the very beginning.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.560]   I'm ordained Southern Baptist.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   We came out of a Southern Baptist church.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.820]   I was raised a Presbyterian, but then I became a Baptist
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.160]   because of my convictions and what I saw in scripture.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.620]   So I got infant baptized and then rebaptized later
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.120]   on after I became a pastor.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.660]   Even though we're Southern Baptist,
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600]   the reason why I became Southern Baptist is
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.020]   because of the history, not because I want to partner
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.740]   with other churches, because in the local area,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.440]   the Saddleback has so much influence.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.680]   They're Southern Baptist, and they have so much influence
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.040]   in the churches in our area, and I didn't feel like we fit
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   in with that -- with the way that they did church.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.660]   But because of Dr. Michael Proud, and who is the head
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.520]   of the Southern Baptist in our area, that we felt
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.140]   like he was really like-minded, and as a result of that,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.480]   I went to India, got to know him,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.200]   and that's how we got involved with the Southern Baptist.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.320]   And so because it's voluntary, we just kind of get involved
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100]   with what we can, but our primary focus is just
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.700]   within the church, okay?
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.100]   And so we are involved, but not like a --
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860]   you know, those people who are heavily involved,
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.320]   they go to meeting every single week,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.560]   like sometimes twice a week.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.680]   They do Easter services together.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.760]   You know, they have pastoral retreats.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.600]   We just -- I'm just not involved with that, right?
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.160]   But I do get involved with, if there is a like-minded church
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.940]   coming in, to try to support them, and then financially.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.280]   And then we give to them.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.180]   So if there's disasters, instead of just giving randomly,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.120]   we give it to the Southern Baptist relief work.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.060]   So they'll usually contact the Southern Baptist Church,
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.220]   let's say in Florida, or somewhere
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.040]   that disaster happens, or Haiti.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.620]   Remember when that earthquake happened?
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.520]   So we send finances to the Southern Baptist Board,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.860]   and then they would send it to the local church in that area,
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.200]   and then they would use those funds to help the people,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   so that the funds aren't just going
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.600]   through random communities,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.760]   going to Southern Baptist churches.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.840]   And then, because our Pastor Alex is coming
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.440]   under the Southern Baptist IMB, International Mission Board,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.040]   so we used to give offering here and there, but once he gets in,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.880]   he gets funded, our -- some part of our mission budget is going
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.080]   to be sent to the Southern Baptist,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.200]   because they're supporting him.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.620]   It's not required.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.440]   It's just voluntary.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.320]   Okay.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.420]   Okay, so this is for me.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.520]   So replacement theology basically is a covenant theology
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.480]   versus dispensation.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.260]   It's like, where does Israel stand?
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.160]   Our church's stance in that is
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.960]   that God still has a place for Israel.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.160]   The church did not replace Israel.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.560]   Church came alongside Israel, right?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.300]   And there's a big difference between the two.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.640]   And there's a larger theology that requires more time
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.960]   to explain, which I'm not going to get into.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:03.140]   But the reason why I believe that is because if you look
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.700]   at the Old Testament prophecies about what God is going to do
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.600]   with Israel, it's pretty clear that God is going to --
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.740]   like, they've experienced a hardening of their heart
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.860]   and the judgment of God.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.080]   But at the period of the Messianic period,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   which we believe is the period of the millennium,
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.080]   that God is going to restore Israel.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.100]   And so the language is pretty clear about that.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.260]   So if you don't believe that, you have to interpret all
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.260]   of that allegorically.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.220]   That when every time he mentions Israel being restored,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.480]   Israel's king being restored, and they're going to go back
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.500]   to their land, all of that is interpreted allegorically
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.760]   and fulfilled in the church.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.520]   And the reason why they do that is
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.600]   because there are some passages in Galatians and other parts
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.580]   where it says a true Jew is one
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.440]   who is circumcised in the heart, right?
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.380]   And then in Romans chapter 9, it talks
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.440]   about how they experienced a hardening of the heart
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.260]   of the fullness of the Gentiles have come in,
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.300]   and then they're going to receive a revival.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.960]   So they interpret those passages
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.720]   as the church has completely replaced it, right?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.020]   And this is something that's going to require more time,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.380]   but I'll give you in a nutshell the couple things
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.060]   that convinced me that the Israel --
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.300]   there is a place for Israel.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.260]   One, if you look at all the prophecies of the coming
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.480]   of Christ, all of it was fulfilled literally.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.800]   Right? He came on a donkey.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.540]   He was betrayed by the leaders.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.060]   He was born in Bethlehem.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.880]   So almost everything that the Jews are --
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.860]   it's like, "Oh, this is crazy.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.260]   Why would the Messiah suffer?"
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.680]   And they couldn't understand why.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.700]   So when they didn't understand it,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.180]   they interpreted it allegorically, right?
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.420]   But if you look at the way the prophecy was interpreted
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.580]   and it was fulfilled, it was fulfilled literally,
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.920]   every part of it.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.460]   So to me, it's inconsistent to look
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.480]   at the Old Testament prophecy, and then all
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.280]   of a sudden allegorize everything,
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.620]   considering how it was fulfilled in the New Testament.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.460]   And then if you go to the -- if you go to the End Times,
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.140]   the Book of Revelation, I think it's Revelation Chapter 5,
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.700]   we see a scene of worship, and it says 144,000 Jews,
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.560]   and then the nation standing behind them.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.020]   So if at the end, if the Jews
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.620]   and the Gentiles are the same church, why do --
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.540]   are they separated in identifying them as Jews
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.640]   and Gentiles at the end, right?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And so all through that, when we put that all together, yes,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.340]   the church has been grafted into God's kingdom
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.900]   because God's people is not just Israel.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.240]   God's people is everybody who confesses Christ as Lord
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.500]   and Savior, but within that, God has a special place
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.220]   for the nation of Israel, right?
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.140]   And I believe that that is still going to be fulfilled at the end,
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.480]   and that's where the millennium comes in.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.260]   Okay.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.800]   In our church, we practice male leadership in our church
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.000]   as a fulfillment of 1 Corinthians Chapter 3
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.860]   and 1 Corinthians -- 1 Timothy Chapter 2.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.820]   And so we do have female deacons.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.800]   We've had female deacons, and --
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.220]   but we do not have female elders in our church, okay?
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.380]   And I don't know if I need to go into details of that,
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.560]   but basically, this is one of those things that I wrestled
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.960]   with when I was in seminary because one of the first pastors
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   that I really respected was a female pastor.
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.060]   And so I used to drive down to the valley just to listen
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.840]   to her, and then so when I came upon this theology,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.880]   it didn't make much sense to me.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.820]   And then so I went, and I actually volunteered
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.700]   to do a paper on this.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.740]   So in the class that I was at, they gave us an option
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.360]   to do a paper on any subject that we wanted,
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.520]   and I chose this subject because I was wrestling with this.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.220]   And the end conclusion was the Bible --
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.020]   to me, was the Bible clearly teaches this.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.640]   And this view is called complementarian,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   and where women have passed --
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.220]   do pass it is called egalitarian view.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.700]   And so we're complementarian, meaning that God had created men
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.460]   and women equal, equal in value, but complement in activity,
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.480]   right, just like the Trinity, right?
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.440]   They have different roles, but they are equal in value, right?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.980]   And so that's what we teach.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.560]   So again, this -- this something requires a lot more attention.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.420]   So if you wrestle with this and want more explanation,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.980]   like I encourage you to come and talk to me personally.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.540]   Okay.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:22.020]   Okay. I'm just going to explain what this is
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.000]   because this was not asked in this group.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.760]   Open but cautious view basically is that we're open --
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.360]   the charismatic gifts -- I don't see anything in the scripture
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.260]   that says it cannot happen, but anything
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.800]   that can happen must be biblical.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.240]   It needs to meet the biblical standard.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.120]   So, you know, like does miracles happen?
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.520]   Of course.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.920]   I don't think anybody will say --
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.320]   even if you're a cessationist,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   will say that the gifts don't happen.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.280]   But it needs to meet the biblical standard, right?
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.120]   Meaning that if somebody says they're going to prophesy,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.720]   the prophecy has to be 100% accurate.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.900]   You can't be right 50% and wrong 50%
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.500]   because in the Old Testament they got stoned for that, right?
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.400]   And then if you're going to talk about spiritual gifts
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.960]   and somebody is healed, the healing has
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.500]   to meet the biblical standard.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.440]   Meaning like it's not hidden.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.400]   It's not something that they couldn't identify.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.540]   It's not something like, oh, you have to have faith
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.240]   to believe that.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.980]   It has to live up to the biblical standard
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.880]   where even the non-Christians who didn't want
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.340]   to believe it couldn't deny it.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.640]   That's the biblical standard that we see
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.020]   in the scripture, right?
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.460]   So the reason why I won't say I'm a cessationist is
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.220]   because I don't see anything in the scripture
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.660]   that says it cannot happen, right?
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.740]   But much of what I see
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.720]   in the charismatic community today sometimes is
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.460]   very distracting because like you have to want to believe it.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.460]   Right? So that's what an open but cautious view is.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.060]   Again, you didn't ask this question so I'm not going
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.700]   to get too deep into that.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.940]   KJV, no. Okay.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.780]   Okay, this was answered here.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.640]   I'm just going to give you a short version of this.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.480]   Why is corporate worship -- I mean, the fact that worship is
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.520]   central to the church and to our lives,
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.580]   I think I've spoken enough about it, right?
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.520]   That worship is what we were created for.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.860]   Worship was what was broken
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.700]   and worship is what is being restored.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.760]   But the specific question is the corporate worship, right?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.960]   If you study through the Old Testament, God doesn't see --
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.700]   God doesn't speak to about an individual completely
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.540]   in isolation.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:36.340]   He'll say, you know, like he's the son of somebody, right?
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.380]   And he's always from the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.580]   from the tribe of the Simeons.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:49.760]   And so if you remember, in every Jew that identifies himself,
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.420]   identifies himself with his name, his family,
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.820]   and the tribe, and the nation of Israel.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.300]   That's usually the pattern that they have, right?
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.000]   We live in an individualistic society where it's just kind
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.760]   of me and God, right?
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.840]   The Bible doesn't look at it that way.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.980]   In fact, every letter that he wrote to, almost every letter,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.580]   okay, with the exception of maybe two
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.640]   or three was written to the church, right?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.260]   And even in the Sabbath, the requirement
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.020]   for the Sabbath was the corporate body get together
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.120]   for the purpose of worship.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.800]   So it wasn't meant to be, "Oh, we're going to give Sabbath
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.060]   and go home and rest."
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.540]   The purpose of Sabbath was that they can rest from work
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.600]   so that they can gather for the purpose of worship,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   corporate worship.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.200]   You know, scripture says, "Do not be in the habit
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.500]   of forsaking your own assembly, but gather together all the more
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.900]   as you see the day drawing near."
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.940]   So there's repeated pattern over and over again for the purpose
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.680]   of corporate worship, right?
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.820]   Again, I could take a long time talking about this,
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.980]   but this is something that if you have more question
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.620]   about it, we can talk more about it, okay?
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:00.820]   So corporate worship is the most important.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.360]   Worship is the reason why we are saved,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.000]   and corporate worship is the most important
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.400]   of all the worship, okay?
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.740]   It doesn't mean that private worship is not important,
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.100]   but above private worship, corporate worship needs
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.640]   to take center stage, right?
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.780]   That's why we ask like unless it's some kind of an emergency
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.040]   to do your best to attend corporate worship,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.180]   and if you can't attend our local worship,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.520]   to attend corporate worship somewhere else.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:37.100]   [ Background noise ]
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.360]   Let me get back to that.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:47.100]   [ Background noise ]
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.140]   Okay, may I ask this?
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.780]   Is there human authority in the church?
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.380]   Yes, because the scripture says to submit to your elders, right?
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.960]   Is there human authority in the church?
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.560]   Is there -- did God appoint leaders and eventually deacons,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.860]   and is there some kind of authority given
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.380]   in the church?
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.120]   Absolutely.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.240]   But how that authority is played out, right?
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.040]   But I think this question is more specific,
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.820]   not the corporate body of Christ.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.400]   You're talking about a leader follower,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.660]   a one-to-one kind of discipleship, right?
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.620]   Is there authority in that?
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.060]   Is there biblically given authority to somebody
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.720]   who's leading you in small group and discipling you?
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.120]   There is nothing in scripture, right?
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.960]   There is nothing in scripture that creates a relationship
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.980]   where somebody who's older has that kind
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.940]   of authority over your life, right?
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.840]   Now, you can give them that authority
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.500]   because out of respect, but this is not a biblical mandate
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.160]   in scripture that if somebody is placed over you
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.540]   in your small group, that when they tell you you can't live
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.820]   here, that biblically you can't do that.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.240]   They do not have that kind of authority.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.880]   So the only authority biblically established is the authority
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.560]   of the elders in the church, right?
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.820]   And that's why there's such a high standard
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.960]   for eldership for that purpose.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.880]   And it says to not to lay hands hastily because to give
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.040]   that kind of authority to somebody who's immature
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.540]   and wielded very poorly and ends up, you know,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.820]   destroying the conscience of many people, right?
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.200]   Now, I know where this question is coming
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.580]   from because I came from a ministry where this was taught.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.920]   Submit to your elders, to your leaders,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.680]   and leaders were whoever was discipling you as your leader
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.740]   and you obey them absolutely.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.360]   And that's part of the reason why I left that ministry
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.040]   because I didn't think that was biblical.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.760]   Even within the structure of leadership in the church,
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.720]   there's a warning to the elders not
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.000]   to lord it over their faith, right?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   Meaning that our authority that was given, it was given to us
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.620]   for the purpose of sacrificing,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.740]   just like a leadership role in the family.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.460]   And he said he's called to sacrifice for his wife.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.140]   So his role of leadership is to reflect what Jesus did.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.700]   He humbled himself, got on his knees and washed their feet.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.740]   And he said, "You guys do the same.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.840]   So your apostolic authority is just like mine.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.280]   Get on your knees and wash their feet," right?
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.200]   So the authority in the church is given for the purpose
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.080]   of protecting the church.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.160]   So there are certain things that we may say, "Hey,
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.780]   at the church we're just not going to allow this.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.700]   And it's not because of my preference," that we believe,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.720]   even if you disagree, we believe that this needs to be done
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.640]   for the purpose of protecting the church,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.620]   for the church's own benefit, right?
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.560]   Even if it is detrimental to us.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.380]   So if a leader is afraid of criticism because he's afraid
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.040]   of his own reputation and rather live in peace with everybody,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.000]   he can't lead properly.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.980]   So part of what it means to be a leader is he has
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.860]   to make difficult decisions for the benefit of the church,
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.880]   for the purpose of benefiting the church, right?
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   Now, so we're talking biblically.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.520]   So biblically, that's where the Bible leaves it, right?
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.060]   So individual people don't have authority
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.800]   over the other individual because you happen
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.660]   to be in their small group.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.580]   We're called to serve one another.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.540]   Now having said that, there's cultural, you know,
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.160]   if you happen to be a strictly,
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.440]   especially in the Korean community, the older
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.760]   versus younger, more experienced versus less,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.360]   that's a cultural thing.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.280]   That's not a biblical mandate, right?
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.540]   And how much you give authority,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.300]   how much you respect and honor, that's something that happens
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.060]   within that relationship, right?
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.360]   Just from experience, whether it's running the church
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.580]   or leading my wife or even raising my own kids,
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:37.000]   like anytime I say, "Hey, the Bible says you need to submit,"
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.660]   I've already lost that person.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.380]   If I have to use scripture to kind of like wave it and say,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.880]   "You know, if you want to obey God, you better obey me."
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.060]   So, and if they're a committed Christian and they're committed
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.020]   to the scripture, they may, right?
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.280]   They may obey, but they're going to come kicking and screaming.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.740]   They're not partnering with you.
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.260]   They're not, you know, they're not going to be helpful.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.380]   They're just doing it.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.680]   Majority of the people won't even do it, right?
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.220]   So if ever I have to come to my wife and say, "Esther,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.000]   I'm your husband, submit," I've already lost her.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.860]   Right? So I'm not being a good leader.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.700]   A good leader will inspire someone to support you, right?
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.600]   So I've learned that, you know,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.360]   even though the Bible does give me authority as a pastor,
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.820]   as a father, and as a husband, if I don't wield
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.920]   that in a humble manner, it actually will backfire on me.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.180]   It doesn't benefit the church, and it doesn't benefit me,
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.660]   and it doesn't benefit my children, right?
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.620]   So the best way to lead with authority is
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.080]   to do exactly what Jesus did.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.260]   Learn to empty yourself.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.940]   And every decision you make, you make sure
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.060]   that it's for their good.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.560]   And sometimes they won't recognize it, right?
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.760]   Especially when you're raising kids.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.160]   You have to make decisions that they don't like.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.800]   And at that moment, they'll be kicking and screaming,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.360]   and you're not doing it for yourself.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.820]   You're doing it for them.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.800]   And a lot of times that happens in the church, too.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.700]   We have to make decisions because we think this is best
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.020]   for the church, and you get a reaction from the church,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.140]   and say, "But that's part of being a leader," right?
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:20.840]   So again, biblical authority, one-to-one,
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.180]   there is no such thing.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.160]   In fact, I think it's dangerous because you have
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.100]   that many people who are walking around.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.340]   And the reason why we don't put leadership hastily is
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.140]   because once that person has that kind
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.460]   of authority, it ruins them.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.780]   You tell an immature person, and you give them authority,
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.880]   they're not going to wield it in gentleness.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.640]   They're not going to wield it in humility.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.520]   They're going to try to dominate people.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.620]   And then they're going to say, "The Bible says," right?
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.960]   And it's not good for them.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.280]   It's not good for the people underneath them.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.960]   Okay, let me answer this, and then I'll just open it
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.760]   up to, you know, whatever questions
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.580]   that you guys might have.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.760]   This is such a large question because it depends
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.180]   on which pocket you're looking at.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.620]   You can -- our church is big enough where you can look
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.000]   at one group and say, "Wow, you know, so encouraged.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.920]   They're doing so many things, and they love Christ."
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.600]   And then you go over here and talk to these people,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.800]   it's like, "Did they even hear what I said?"
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.220]   Like, and you can get -- I can get, like, such a large spectrum
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   of response in the church where so encouraged to,
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.040]   "I don't want to do this anymore,"
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.380]   like literally within the same day.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.760]   So it really depends on which pocket, who I'm talking to,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.160]   and what age bracket, and at what time of the day.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.360]   And then there's people who are strong when they were single,
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.120]   and then they struggle when they're married.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.600]   And there's people who, you know, were struggling,
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.380]   and then they wake up when they get married.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.500]   So, you know, it's kind of hard to say
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.340]   with one statement how the whole church is doing.
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.580]   But generally, you know, I would say, you know,
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.860]   I'm very encouraged to see, especially with the new movement
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.220]   in the church, like where we are.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.800]   I told our church leadership, like, some --
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.400]   I don't know if anybody was here during that time.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.780]   Joe was the only one who was here.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.820]   There's a -- there's a very handful, like maybe six or seven
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.160]   who are maybe less than 10 who are here
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.100]   that was there at that time.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.460]   But it was right around the time when we were --
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.360]   I was really struggling.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.860]   I was going back and forth to Vegas,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.920]   and I really didn't know if I was going to continue.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.000]   It was -- I was just month to month,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.740]   and then SR and I made a decision.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.540]   I think it was in December, and we said, "You know what?
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.620]   We're going to sell our house.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.040]   We're going to try to just live off of whatever we get from that,
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.660]   and then at the end of next year,
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.140]   if we're at the same place," which we were completely
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.120]   expecting because our church is already six,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.300]   seven years old at that time.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.060]   But at least we have nothing.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.280]   We walk away with nothing in our pocket.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.700]   I have no job, no money in the bank, three kids I got to feed.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.720]   Then I could just, like, say, "Okay, what else can I do?
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.700]   I got to go get a job, and I got to take care of my family."
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.640]   And so we made that decision.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.000]   We came out, and about one-third of the church left.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.400]   Instead of growing, we actually had people say, "Okay,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.700]   now it's time to leave," so they left.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.780]   But the thing is, every time one person left,
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.920]   another person would come in.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.000]   And so in about five, six-month period,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.580]   we had the same number of people,
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.380]   but half the church was completely different.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.180]   And so anybody who was kind of, like, on the fridge,
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.680]   and they weren't taking their faith seriously,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.460]   or they're on their way out, they left.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.880]   And then the new people came in were brand-new converts.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.500]   They weren't, like, necessarily strong Christians,
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.260]   but they were either brand-new converts,
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.320]   or even non-Christians came in, but they were hungry.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.480]   And then the people who remained, which are the people
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.120]   who are here now, they eventually, obviously,
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.480]   became leaders in the church.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.120]   And so the church environment changed radically, right?
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.040]   So right around that time, I remember we --
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.080]   that's when we had Ray Cosley come,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.000]   and he gave our first retreat.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.960]   It was, like, six, seven years into the church,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.280]   we had our very first retreat.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.980]   And the reason why is because I was working.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.360]   I just didn't have time, right?
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.480]   And it was just down the street from here.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.900]   It wasn't Best Western.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.100]   It was a -- if you look at the room that we were in,
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.380]   it was literally, like, here up to here.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.640]   That was our meeting hall.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.100]   He preached up there, and then we sat back here,
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.320]   and that's how our meeting was.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.240]   And then we walked across the street to a hometown buffet
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.280]   for breakfast and lunch.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   Yeah, every day, because we couldn't cook,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.760]   so it was right across the street.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.720]   So we got so tired of that food.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.260]   But right around that time, we were praying,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.900]   and just the spiritual environment of the church,
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.020]   and not because we were mature, but type of excitement
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.440]   in the church completely -- there was an overhaul
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.600]   in the church, and I remember telling the church that, like,
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.060]   not that we were going to grow, but this is a church
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.480]   that I would bring my family to.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.180]   Prior to that, I couldn't say that with confidence.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.180]   Like, if I invited people to our church,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.940]   I felt like I was asking them to do me a favor
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.500]   to come to my church, and I just couldn't do that.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.200]   Right? If it's not a church that I would send my daughter to,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.380]   I'm not going to ask you to come either.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.860]   And so we didn't do anything to grow the church,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.240]   because I just felt like spiritually, we just weren't there.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.620]   And then right in that six-month period, we felt like,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.500]   this is a church that I think I would bring people to, you know?
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.160]   Not for me, but because I think it would benefit them
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.820]   because of the fellowship of the church and everything.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.700]   Sure enough, we did nothing, right?
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.560]   Joke contest, but we did absolutely nothing different.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.360]   It's just from June to December,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.280]   the church almost doubled in size.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.440]   And again, you have to understand, like, for five,
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.520]   six years, we were the exact same.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.160]   So why do we think that all of a sudden this is going to change?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.500]   Because the church changed.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.800]   It was a completely different environment in the church.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.440]   There was a hunger growing in the church.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.860]   I shared with our leadership that that's the sense
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.480]   that I get right now in our church,
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.200]   that there is a growing hunger in the church.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.040]   It's not because we're doing anything like,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.360]   "Oh, we're doing this so much better,
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.740]   and we've addressed this issue."
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.040]   It's just that for whatever the reason,
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.460]   that God is stirring up people, you know, inside the church,
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.460]   and then new people who are coming into the church.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.340]   There is a stirring and hungering in the church
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.100]   that I haven't seen in a long time.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.220]   And it's not that, you know, our church was bad for so long.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:21.960]   It's not that.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.220]   It's just something beyond us that God is doing,
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.900]   and I sense that, right?
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.520]   It's not because we're mature.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.120]   It's not because we have greater programs.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.020]   Nothing about my preaching has changed.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.340]   It's just that there is a growing hunger.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:41.700]   And because of that, I feel the same thing I sensed when we were
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.960]   at that stage of the church.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.240]   So we're trying to prepare for that.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.060]   We're praying.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.320]   There's a greater sense of weightiness.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.120]   You know, if the Lord's bringing people here who are hungry,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.480]   I want to make sure that they're being fed, you know.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.000]   So I'm not as overly concerned about the system,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.060]   about the organization, because they're coming to eat.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.760]   And I want to make sure that they're being fed.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.920]   And if they're fed, they're going to have energy.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.480]   And if they have energy, then they're going to go out
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.240]   and serve the church.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.640]   And so I feel like, generally speaking, that's how I feel
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.840]   where we are at in the church.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.460]   I am not blind to our shortcomings.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.080]   I'm not blind to pockets of things that are going on.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.460]   But generally speaking, there is a stirring and hungering,
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.840]   and I'm very encouraged by seeing that.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.400]   And to be honest, it really has nothing to do with us,
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.780]   because God wants to be glorified.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.500]   And if anything does happen, it's just
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.400]   like when our church grew.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.260]   It's like, what did you do?
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.460]   Same thing we did when we didn't grow.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.420]   We're doing the same thing when nobody cared.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.060]   People walked out because of my preaching.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.080]   We're doing the exact same thing.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.500]   So there's nothing that's changing.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.920]   It's just that there's a growing hunger.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.200]   And I think people want to meet the Lord, you know.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.780]   And I sense that that's growing.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.720]   Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.420]   Okay, let me open it up if you have any questions
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.320]   that you'd like to ask.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:10.160]   I know we're Asian, so I don't expect anything.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:32.220]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.900]   Yeah. You know, when I first went to Biola,
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.300]   the first time I heard somebody just end the prayer,
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.460]   and he just prays, "Thank you, Lord."
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.620]   And he just walked off.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.640]   And I kept my eyes closed, and I said, "What was that?"
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.020]   He didn't say Jesus' name.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.080]   So it took me a while to get used to it because, you know,
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.880]   there's things that we do, like in patterns.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.960]   So if you happen to go to church all your life with a suit on,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.780]   and then you go to a church
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.140]   where people are not wearing suits,
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.280]   it's just uncomfortable enough
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.820]   where you might actually not attend.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.980]   So I had to wrestle with, is that a biblical thing
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.900]   that I need to kind of wrestle with, or is that something
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.360]   that I just need to, you know?
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.920]   And so my understanding when it says praying in Jesus' name,
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.880]   it's not some formula that if we attach
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.840]   that somehow it's better.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.440]   Obviously, it's talking about in Jesus' name that my access
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.520]   to God is through his name, right?
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.960]   So I don't think it's an issue, as long as the person understands
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.360]   that our prayer is in the name of Christ,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.480]   but the actual words of that, yeah.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.860]   I try to say it just because it's a comfort thing for me,
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.820]   and I know that there's other people in the church that may kind
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.900]   of like have a reaction, "Oh, he didn't say it."
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.660]   But generally speaking, I don't want to make that like, "Okay,
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.100]   we need to say this," right?
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.920]   Because I know what it means,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.040]   and I know that that's what they mean, yeah.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.160]   That's my view.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:10.460]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.920]   Is that part of the Bible?
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.360]   >> Again, you know, there's a difference between, you know,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.340]   how we interpret Scripture that's prescriptive
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.140]   and descriptive.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.260]   Descriptive is we see it in the Scripture, like they did it.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.680]   There's a difference between that versus prescriptive saying,
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.100]   "You must do this," right?
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.940]   So those things come, like saying in Jesus' name,
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.760]   that's not even in the Bible, other than that,
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.740]   it's just through church history, people have done that.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.300]   Saying amen is when you look at the Psalms, you know,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.240]   they would have like some kind of prayer,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.200]   and they would say, "Selah," or they would say, "Amen,"
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.700]   and it's said in agreement.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.700]   So it is not commanded in Scripture,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.180]   it's just descriptive because we see it, right?
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.520]   And that's their way of like, "Yes, thank you."
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.140]   Or say, "We agree with that."
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.220]   So it is not mandated, it just, we just see a pattern.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:15.300]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.840]   Yeah, so that's a good question.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.820]   It's here, I don't know why it's not up here.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:26.380]   When BMC was planted, it wasn't like we had this plan,
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.840]   you know, in five years, let's plant a church,
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.940]   so let's raise up people so we can go plant a church.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.900]   Nor was it like, you know, never in our mind
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.860]   that we're ever going to do this, right?
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.040]   Is there a need for churches?
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.940]   Yes. But not just any church because, you know,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.540]   I see in Irvine like every year there's three or four churches
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.820]   that want to come to Irvine because Irvine's a growing place
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.940]   and there's a campus here.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.540]   And the Protestant church is so segmented
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.300]   that everybody has their own agenda.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.920]   And you may be preaching the same thing
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.220]   that the other church is preaching
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.760]   and doing the exact same thing, but you want your brand.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.100]   And so I remember when I was going out in the street doing
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.960]   like homeless ministry, like other churches would come
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.820]   and set up just down the street and we would tell them, "Hey,
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.200]   we have a ministry here," but they wanted their church
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.100]   to feed the homeless.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.520]   It wasn't enough to feed the homeless, it's like it had
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.500]   to be under their church name, right?
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.180]   And eventually the reason why we stopped going was
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.700]   because there was this large charismatic church that came.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.620]   They had more money, better food.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.500]   This lady was cooking tortilla soup every week.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.740]   We had stale donuts.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.200]   And then I made a tuna sandwich
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.080]   and the whole thing cost like 20 bucks.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.480]   So obviously it wasn't good, you know?
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.180]   And then they were coming with these bags of tortilla chips
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.260]   and they had mic systems and all that.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.620]   And we told them, "Hey, we're doing this.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.180]   Can you join us in this?"
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.480]   They just wanted their own brand.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.360]   So we joined them.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.760]   So we ended up joining.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.320]   Even though we were there for like seven years,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.680]   we just kind of joined them, put our stuff on their table.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.720]   But the reason why we stopped going was because they started
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.020]   to yell at the homeless people.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.380]   Like, "If you don't -- shut up.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.380]   I'm not going to feed you."
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.200]   And so they started --
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.400]   the homeless people would stay away from the preaching
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.420]   and then they would just come to eat and we didn't want
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.060]   to be a part of that.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.080]   And that's why we stopped going.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.580]   The reason why I share that story is because we have
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.220]   to be careful that our desire
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.440]   to plant churches isn't our branding
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.340]   that we're trying to spread, you know?
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.040]   That we want to make sure that it's the gospel,
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.780]   that it's the kingdom of God that we're spreading, right?
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.300]   So when we decided to plant the churches
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.600]   because we had the resources.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.040]   When I say resources, I'm not just talking about money.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.920]   We had manpower.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.660]   And like, "Oh, don't we have manpower now?"
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.960]   If we had five errant choys,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.560]   we would have planted five churches already.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.920]   And the reason why I say that, I'm not saying that, you know,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.340]   only errant choys of the world can plant churches.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.460]   Pastor Aaron was very fruitful in our church.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.260]   He -- his people loved his --
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.600]   not only his preaching and teaching, but his leadership.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.100]   He had sound judgment.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.660]   The years that I've observed him, it wasn't --
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.240]   even though he's a very clear teacher,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.520]   to me his primary gift isn't teaching, it's leadership.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.800]   He had very sound judgment.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.780]   He's able to make hard decisions even if it is unpopular.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.860]   So everything that I saw is like,
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.040]   he is capable of leading a church.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.440]   So I've seen so many situations where you have a vision
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.540]   and then you find people to plug in that vision,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.840]   and then they go out and then they struggle, you know.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.580]   I said, "Oh, how come God's not blessing us?"
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.560]   So our typical way we do church planting is we have a vision
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.480]   and then we work hard and then we pray
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.220]   that God would join us, right?
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.460]   And I learned early on, and my philosophy is,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.220]   see where God is working and join him.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.120]   It was clear that God was working in Pastor Aaron's life.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.740]   And that -- so when he decided to plant a church,
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.020]   people packed up their bags and went.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.720]   Because they trusted him.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.380]   They trusted his leadership.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.220]   So even now, like if we had another Aaron Choi, you know,
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.180]   and I'm not saying that our other pastors are not capable,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.380]   you know, but I'm saying like everything that I saw
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.820]   from my personal experience
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.420]   that would be required a high-end priority is necessary
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.760]   to be able to lead in that capacity and to be successful,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.240]   Pastor Aaron Choi had, right?
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.560]   There's a lot of people who are capable of teaching,
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.480]   but they're not good at leading.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.100]   There's people who are good at counseling,
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.880]   but they have a hard time like standing in front of people
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.680]   and gathering people.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.500]   Or some people are good at counseling,
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.520]   but they're not good at preaching.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.580]   And so when you plant the church and if you're weak in some
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.700]   of those areas, like the people
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.740]   within the congregation, they start really struggling.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.340]   And so they're not being fed.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.020]   They're not being led.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:43.420]   So if we were in China or in India where there's nothing,
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.500]   anything is better, right?
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.180]   But that's not where we live.
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.980]   We have a church down the street.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.880]   We have people competing to bring people to their church.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.960]   So I would only plant the church if I thought
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.440]   that the person who's planning the church are going to be able
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.480]   to be effective in the context of all the other churches
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.240]   that are around, right?
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.620]   So it's not -- so that we don't just add to like,
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.600]   here's 15 other churches,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.220]   and here's another church because it's brilliant.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.640]   And that's the only reason why.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:14.140]   If you ask me personally, you know, like say, oh,
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.400]   how about you planting a church?
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.580]   And I fantasize about this.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.800]   And it's probably not going to happen.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.820]   But if I was to ever plant a church,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.260]   it would probably not be in the United States.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.720]   I thought about Korea, China, other places,
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.060]   but not in the United States.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.940]   I didn't really even plant this church, though.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.240]   This church just happened.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.780]   In fact, the interesting story was I had a group of friends,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.880]   one attorney, one internist doctor.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.540]   They're all my age and already into professional careers,
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.660]   who was asking me to plant a church
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.420]   so that we can plant a church.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.100]   But I didn't want to do it because I didn't feel
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:55.720]   like I was ready.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.140]   You know, I was burnt out, and I was in no condition
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.520]   to lead a church and give them a vision and rally them up
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.180]   and train them.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.460]   And I was just trying to survive at that time.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:09.220]   And then I came to this church to help out because the guy
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.380]   who started the church just took off.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.780]   So I just came in to kind of plug in the role
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.300]   and then we got kicked out.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.960]   And then we became a church plant with a bunch
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.580]   of high school students and one college student, you know,
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.820]   and one guy paying tithe.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.160]   And so it wasn't like a church plant.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.300]   We were just surviving.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.900]   And people said, "Oh, you know, good thing you obeyed God."
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.780]   I was like, "I don't think I obeyed God."
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.540]   I'm just being honest.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.520]   It wasn't like I prayed.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.800]   It was like, "Lord, what do you want me to do?"
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.000]   I saw a bunch of kids that I felt like wasn't going
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.680]   to make it if I left and out of obligation.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.360]   You know, because if I was going to plant the church,
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.420]   I would have planted with those guys.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.500]   They're all working people.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.420]   They're all my age.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.340]   I'm not going to plant a church with a bunch of college students.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.380]   I just had two kids and I just had another kid
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.220]   in about three years after we planted the church.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.280]   That's insane.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.520]   Who would do that with no income?
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.960]   Yeah, I wouldn't have planted this church.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.000]   So everything about this church was just God had his plan
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.580]   and I'm absolutely convinced when the scripture says
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.980]   that God seeks his own glory.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.720]   So when somebody asks what happened at this church,
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.840]   I can only tell them what happened, how we got planted.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.440]   It was God gets the glory for this.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.160]   It wasn't a smart pastor.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.680]   It wasn't because of our planning.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.140]   It wasn't because of our denomination.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.700]   It was because we didn't get funded.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.640]   You know, in the first five, six years, nothing happened
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.520]   and we did everything.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.140]   We're not doing anything different, you know,
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.000]   and yet in God's timing.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.660]   So when God says what happened at Berean,
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.940]   nobody takes the credit like God did.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.440]   He said to preach the word faithfully in season
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.060]   and out of season.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.300]   If there's one thing that we did
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.100]   from the beginning until now, it's that.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.540]   So even now if you say like five,
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.960]   I can tell you five years like, oh, I would like to see this,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.380]   but in the end, nothing I planned worked, you know.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.120]   So it's not that I don't have thoughts, but in the end,
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.000]   I'm going to let God bear the fruit and we're going to obey
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.060]   and we're going to submit.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.300]   So some people ask me like, what's your target group?
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.200]   I don't have a target group.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.820]   I've never had a target group.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.660]   It's like, do you want multicultural, you know,
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.120]   what group and I told people from the very beginning,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.060]   if Hispanics come to church,
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.940]   those are the people I'm going to minister to.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.380]   If we have a bunch of high school kids come,
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.420]   those are the people I'm going to minister to.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.560]   If everybody that comes are senior citizens,
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.160]   that's the people I'm going to minister to.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.880]   If they all happen to be Chinese or Korean
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.680]   or different nationality, wherever God is working
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.560]   and bringing, those are the people that are going to target.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.500]   I don't have a target group to go after.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.620]   And that's how we've always been.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.040]   So we don't have like a, I don't have a picture in my head
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.660]   of what I want the church to look like, other than, you know,
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.020]   one thing that I share, like early church,
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.940]   when we started the church,
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.880]   the seeker-friendly movement was in full-blown, you know,
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.300]   like every seeker-friendly church, you turn around,
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.060]   they were doubling in size, right?
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.700]   And so this tiny little church,
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.060]   this pastor who's burnt out, you know,
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.700]   and everywhere I went, they were telling me to get retrained,
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.020]   you know, because I didn't know what I was doing,
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.520]   because we're suffering, I'm not able to take care of my kids,
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.280]   you know, why are you being stubborn?
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:27.760]   And it was so frustrating, not because I was tempted to do that,
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.500]   and I remember, I mean, Joe knows, I used to say, like,
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.620]   I'd rather dig ditches than to do church like that,
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.540]   because it bothers my conscience.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.980]   I know that's not from God, right?
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.820]   Playing games to get people to come to church,
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.620]   that's not from God.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.860]   At least if you dig a ditch, at the end of the day,
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.540]   it's deeper than when you first started, you did something, right?
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.060]   You can bury something that is useful.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.580]   To build a church that has nothing to do with God,
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.140]   just because you gather people, what does that do?
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.980]   You're committed to be fake, you know?
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.180]   And so, but in the early church, those are the church that was growing.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.380]   People would come and say, "Hey, are you,
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.860]   do you believe in predestination?"
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.420]   And I'd say, "Yes," and they would just walk up.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.900]   They didn't want Bible teaching.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.660]   The fact that we had membership was enough to turn people away, you know,
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.860]   and the church wasn't growing.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:19.460]   Our finance, I mean, in God's eyes, it was a blessing,
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.420]   but humanly, it was a joke.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:27.740]   Basically, our whole budget for the five, six years of the church was,
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.860]   we paid rent, whatever was left came to me.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.060]   That was our budget.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.780]   We had no line item, like education, admissions, you know?
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.700]   And the first time we had a meeting, we were trying to buy a projector,
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:45.140]   and there was about 25 people in the room, and we're trying to buy a projector,
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.060]   and there was an objection in the church because they're saying, like,
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.260]   "We can't pay the pastor.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.740]   Why are we buying a projector?"
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.140]   So, we couldn't pass.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.700]   We couldn't pass it, so because they were against it, you know?
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.460]   And then, so one of our elders actually just bought it,
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.580]   and they just donated it to the church, and that's how we got our first projector.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.100]   That was our budget.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.300]   It was like, those are two line items, rent, and then rest, go to the pastor,
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:08.740]   and that was it.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:15.780]   But seriously, in the midst of all of that, like, God, you know, built the,
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.420]   in my opinion, God built the church where he gets the credit.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.100]   Just like the apostles, like, oh, which apostle?
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.540]   Why were they so useful?
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.740]   So, God chose a sinner to glorify the gospel, not Paul, not Peter,
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.860]   and so, like, what was so fantastic here?
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:34.700]   Right?
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.740]   At one point, I preached the exact same way.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.500]   You know, I started this church preaching through Romans every Friday.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.740]   You know what the first thing that I heard when I was preaching,
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:49.300]   studying through Romans with Pastor Aaron and Luke and David Rim?
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:54.780]   My first response from them was how much they hated coming to Friday Bible study
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.220]   because it was so boring because they just came from the youth group,
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.100]   and they were always having activity, like, tennis day and all that,
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.260]   and all of a sudden, they come to the church,
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.500]   and we're just going through the book of Romans.
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.700]   And, you know, and I'm dying.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.420]   Like, I'm just making it, just trying to pay bills,
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.220]   and then the response I get is like, this is so boring.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.860]   It's like, we're not having a retreat.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.180]   But it took a while.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.220]   You know, it took a while to catch on.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:29.900]   It took, and I shared this story before, but the first person that I felt like I was able
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.380]   to get their attention was Joe.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.060]   He was in college when we started.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.020]   He graduated college.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.460]   He was preparing to go into CHP, and then he spent a lot of time
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.780]   in the car listening to sermons.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.140]   I think it was Calvary Chapel sermons that he was listening to.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.180]   He was listening to maybe about five, six, seven sermons a day
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.540]   because he was doing delivery to architecture firms.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:55.140]   And this is three years into the church, you know,
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.740]   and I was preaching exactly the same way.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.020]   You know, maybe I can do a better job expositing today, but at least in my mind,
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.660]   I thought I was doing exposition, and just the response I got was not good.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.220]   You know, they would come, and they would hear the secret friendly sermons and say,
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.260]   how come we're not doing this?
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.220]   You know, we need to be more cutting edge, and we need to do this to reach out,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.300]   and I said, I'm not going to do that.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.980]   You know, my conscience will not allow me to do that.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.620]   I quit before I do that, right?
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.340]   So some people were frustrated with me.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:23.860]   They laughed.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.420]   Some people, you know, a lot of them early on, they stuck with the church
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.020]   because we were such a young church, and we had, you know,
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:35.260]   you know, we had a really good community where we genuinely loved each other.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.180]   And I cared for them, and I kind of functioned like a father figure for them.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.980]   You know, some of them, I taught them how to drive when they were younger,
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.420]   and so that was the reason why they were there.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.460]   It wasn't because of the vision.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.620]   It took three years, and then Joe was the first one who came to me,
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.180]   like literally in tears, he said, I get it, Peter.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.900]   I said, what do you get?
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.020]   He's like, I see what you're doing.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.540]   And I'm like, what am I doing?
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:05.820]   Because I wanted to hear, you know, I see why you're preaching like that.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.620]   I see why you're doing ministry like that.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:15.900]   So he's the one who had the initial influence upon David and Pastor Aaron
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.900]   and that group, because he was their small group leader.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:23.540]   So once he started to really like come alive, he started influencing them.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.140]   And then when they started getting influenced, it just kind of had a trickle effect, just slowly.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.460]   And then the church really didn't start to grow until they graduated college
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.940]   and they had more time, because they were all --
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.220]   even though we were feeding them in the weekend, during the weekday, they were at CCM,
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.900]   and everybody was just doing their own thing.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.300]   And then when they graduated and finally came and committed like fully to the church,
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.580]   was when the church started to bear fruit.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.420]   But that took three years.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.940]   Those three years were dry, so dry.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.700]   I had somebody come up to me after the sermon, and he's like --
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:06.140]   and with all sincerity, he came to me and he said, "Nothing ever happens at this church."
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.580]   And then he just walked away.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:15.300]   If I mention him, you'll know who he is, but I won't mention his name.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.740]   They just didn't get it in the beginning.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.020]   Yeah, but it took a while.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:27.500]   >> You mentioned a lot of like, well, or about how you're preaching change.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.620]   You know, I felt when you're a high school pastor or a college pastor,
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:40.700]   I guess maybe in the last 10 years, how have you seen your preaching change?
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.220]   >> You know, I didn't go to a master's seminary where they had a like,
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.900]   "Hey, this is how you preach the Bible."
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.940]   So I -- to be honest, I just kind of learned on my own.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.340]   And the way it started was -- it started when I was a youth pastor,
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.540]   because I started preaching topically because that's all I knew.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:02.140]   And then I started preaching through the Bible, at least what I thought was
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   through the Bible, because I just ran out of material.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.980]   To be honest, I ran out of material.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.980]   How many times do you talk about lordship and giving and stewardship and discipleship?
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.340]   And after about 20 sermons, you have to recycle that in a different manner.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.740]   So I started preaching through John, and then I went to Philippians.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.260]   And then so I started preaching, and then I noticed like I enjoyed it much more,
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.980]   because I was actually starting to learn.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:31.180]   I was learning as I was -- so I would say majority of those sermons I probably would throw away,
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.540]   because I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.860]   So some sermons sounded like a commentary, because I just took the commentaries,
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.980]   and this is what it says, and then after a few months of that, I was like, "Oh, this is not working."
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.620]   Like nobody's paying attention.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.820]   And then so I kind of was adjusting.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.500]   So when we first started this church, it's like I was committed to expository preaching,
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.940]   but what that looked like in an actual sermon, I just kind of figured out, right?
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:01.300]   So I probably sound a little bit different, you know, from the beginning.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.100]   So committed to expository preaching, but how much of the Bible is quoted,
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.020]   how much of the like the nuances, syntax was quoted in the sermons,
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.060]   that probably changed as it went along.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:17.780]   Last 10 years, when you ask the last 10 years, the way it changed was something that I realized
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:22.860]   that maybe I wasn't doing well was connecting the text to the metanarrative.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.660]   When I say metanarrative, it's God's redemptive history.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:31.500]   So seeing the text, not just in the context of that verse or that letter,
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.700]   but in what God's doing in history, because if you look at it as one letter from Genesis
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.020]   to Revelation, even if you're studying Ephesians,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.980]   that Ephesians is a part of the larger letter.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.860]   So where does that fit into redemptive history?
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:50.540]   So I would say that's one thing that really kind of like if there was any radical change,
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.940]   like I realized not that I wasn't thinking that,
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.700]   but maybe I wasn't communicating that enough, right?
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.500]   So I wasn't communicating enough, like how does this connect to the redemptive history?
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.300]   What does that have to do with Christ?
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:08.260]   And so I made a deliberate decision to make an effort to connect to that, right?
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.620]   So if there's any change, so if anybody's been here in the preaching in the last 15 years
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.180]   and if you've probably seen any kind of change, that's probably the change.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.420]   So it's not how I'm interpreting the passage, but how I'm applying that passage
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.220]   in the context of the larger message that's going on.
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.820]   So in that sense, I probably, you know, that would be a major, it's not a shift,
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.260]   it's just a greater effort to connect to that.
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.220]   Yeah. I think that's what you're asking, right?
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.020]   I, I, I'm just totally having a rush on.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.380]   No, no. So that was a conscious decision that I made,
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:46.060]   but there's nothing else specifically that I changed other than that.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:59.260]   Yeah, I was wrestling with this, you know, which is interesting
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:04.500]   because I didn't think about what I did early on in the church,
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.500]   but I decided to, I'm probably going to go into the book of Hebrews,
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:14.220]   mainly because Hebrews is what connects Leviticus to the New Testament.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.100]   And so because we're going to finish up Leviticus, by the time we finish up Leviticus,
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.340]   I'm going to be done with Romans.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.460]   And so Hebrews is going to help connect it all together.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:27.180]   And after I made the decision, I was looking back at my sermon notes and see,
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.340]   that's exactly what I did in the early part of the church.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.540]   I studied through the Romans and then I jumped through Hebrews.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.220]   And I mentioned that today, that Pastor Aaron's first sermon was based upon,
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.340]   you know, one of the teachings on Melchizedek.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.300]   And then, um, it's because that's what I was on.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.180]   When we finished Romans, I jumped into Hebrews.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:48.220]   So my brain is wired the same way as back then.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.740]   Yeah. So most likely I'm going to jump into Hebrews,
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.620]   even though we studied through it before,
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.980]   but it was studied like 18 years ago, 17 years ago.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.900]   It's only about, huh? Seven, eight years ago.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.260]   Did I preach it on Sunday? Was it Bible study?
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:08.020]   Oh, the Bible study. Okay. But I did do that in the early church too.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.660]   So that was, this would be my third time through it.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:20.220]   It'd be a very short book.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:26.660]   You know, sometimes I, not for the purpose of general consumption.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.620]   So my dad wrote like several books, autobiography, you know,
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.180]   and he wrote it for his students when he was a teacher. And he, you know,
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.380]   he was like a New Testament scholar. He churches,
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.820]   he taught church history, Greek and Hebrew,
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.420]   which I didn't benefit at all because he was in Korean.
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.180]   So I looked at his books and I didn't understand any of it.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:53.580]   So one day I want to translate his autobiography and he read it very,
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.780]   like he wrote it, wrote it kind of like devotionally.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.180]   And he went through his life since childhood and then he would have like a
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.460]   devotional point. He would go through a passage and how that played out.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.220]   And so I want to translate that for the grandkids, for them to have.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:12.580]   So I kind of thought about just for the purpose of my kids to write kind of like
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.980]   this is what their heritage is.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:19.300]   And I would be the second generation of that like part two of that book would be,
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.660]   would be that. So I thought about that for that purpose.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:28.180]   But generally, I don't know, I may change my mind, but generally speaking,
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:33.540]   like, um, when I die, I'd like to disappear.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.420]   You know what I mean? Like,
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:41.980]   is there anything new that I can say that hasn't been said by somebody?
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.420]   Probably better. You know what I mean?
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.420]   And do I want people scrutinize my life after I die?
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:52.260]   I don't have that confidence. Yeah.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:57.260]   So like I was born and to be responsible for what God has given me here,
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.740]   you know? And so if I die, I mean,
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.740]   there's so many people that have gone before me that are living now and probably
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.940]   will go after me or smarter, better, God, dear, you know? Um,
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.460]   so like, I, you know, you know what I mean? You kind of throw it like,
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.660]   I feel like you're in an NBA game. It's like, Hey, let me take a shot.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.420]   Yeah. So I feel like a small fish in that, in that big pond.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:28.100]   And so I don't have that. Like, Oh, he'd be great if I left.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:33.220]   Maybe for my kids, maybe for the purpose of church history, you know,
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.220]   for, for our church people who are committed to bring in. But to be honest,
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   like is bringing going to be here, you know, 50 years from now,
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.820]   a hundred years from now, you know, like great churches who didn't,
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.860]   who didn't go beyond one generation.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:52.460]   So I'm not going to assume that that's going to happen.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.980]   I hope for my kids sake and for your kids sake of our grandkids sake that they
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.020]   can take the baton and go,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.540]   but look at church history and look at Bible history.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:06.740]   Some of the greatest men had the worst kids, right?
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.060]   The King Hezekiah, you know,
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.900]   one of the best Kings in Israel had the, one of the worst Kings right after
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.740]   God extended his life for 15 years. And Manasseh comes out of that.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:24.860]   So I only know today, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:37.740]   Why did I say, you know, what did you see?
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:42.180]   So this is interesting.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.260]   One thing that I did notice in the,
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.540]   how many years I've been with Pastor Peter is he does,
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.140]   he does yell a little less now.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:56.580]   In the beginning he was high,
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.380]   more often.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.060]   I was angry.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:08.860]   Why I say, cause this was all I knew. Cause I, I came from Irvine Baptist,
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:12.740]   which, which this church came out from.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.540]   So, you know, I was young. I, it was,
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:21.860]   it was something that I didn't know what to do to be honest.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.940]   And it was, you know, he says he didn't know what he was doing,
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.940]   but God was still working. So I was, you know,
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   it started with high school, but so he brought in one of my old pastors from
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.780]   Biola, Pastor Mark,
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:42.180]   and he was very consistent with preaching the word and emphasizing that.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.620]   So it started for me in high school.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.860]   But it was just a smooth transition into
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:53.420]   an emphasis on the Bible. So, you know, what, what,
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.220]   furthermore, I didn't know any other churches to go to.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:01.220]   So that's most of the reason why.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:09.140]   Yeah, that was, there was that, that's,
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.340]   that's
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:19.020]   is there anything like you're noticing the culture of trend that you feel like
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.380]   it'd be dangerous that might be coming into the church?
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:29.260]   Yeah. I mean that, that, that's a constant concern because it,
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.420]   but it's not anything new, you know,
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:36.460]   I think the greatest challenge to the church is always complacency.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.020]   Like there's doctrines, there's like, you know, movements coming,
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.340]   but what erodes the church the most is not,
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:49.260]   is not the fighting. It's not like that, that like we're coming in,
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.060]   it's King James only. And you know,
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.900]   like it's not that cause that actually caused you to be sober because like,
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.460]   Hey, we need to answer these questions.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.180]   Cause the study of the Bible and then address that issue.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.020]   And it kind of gathers a church. People ask, you know,
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.460]   even about the last church discipline that we had at the church, you know,
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.740]   say, Oh, that must've been hard.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   It actually was very sanctifying in the church because it kind of solidified our
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:15.100]   leadership and we spent two days and it really felt like, man,
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.580]   we're in the trenches together that I'm not doing this by myself, that these,
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.660]   these other elders and leaders are, are in the trenches with me.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.380]   So it was encouraging.
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.580]   It was the years of dealing with that by myself that that was hard.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.260]   But this time around, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't just me, you know?
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.060]   So yes, there are stuff that are coming that I'm aware of.
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:40.020]   But the thing that's always on my mind is the constant drifting that,
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:45.060]   that we experience on a day to day basis. Um, cause just cause where we live,
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:49.060]   you know, that's, to me, that's the, that's the biggest problem.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.180]   Like when you are,
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:56.500]   you're slipping away and you don't even realize it until you're there and then
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:00.820]   you try to get back and it is so hard when your heart is like,
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.980]   you know what I mean? A revival heart that you've neglected for that long.
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.140]   It's not something that happens because you went to a retreat and you heard one
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:11.700]   summer sermon and in years of just sticking to what's right.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.500]   Right? Yeah.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.020]   So if there's anything I'm concerned about more than anything else,
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.840]   it's that,
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:21.840]   that we don't erode and keep working on the same things that we've been working
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:23.060]   on all these years.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:26.980]   So that's how we're going back to the basics because nothing has changed.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:30.380]   We want to like the word of God, proper worship,
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.820]   loving one another and evangelizing is what we're going to keep doing.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.420]   We'll make sure that we don't stray from that.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:51.180]   Just a quick question. Like, um, I would think a few years ago we would, uh,
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.020]   we were just involved in China and then like there were the summers where like
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.740]   the majority of the churches go out. And nowadays, like now,
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:01.300]   it's like we're involved in several different countries.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:08.380]   How would you advise us to like as like individually and also as entire
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.340]   congregation to continue to, uh, like participate and be involved in the mission?
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:21.500]   I mean, clearly there is a growing desire, um, in India for sure.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.340]   Because even now, like we didn't,
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.940]   we had to close it before we even opened it because there's, you know,
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:32.060]   and people know that we're not going into a safe area. This is not like a, you know,
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:36.700]   walk through the park and, and I'm like deliberately scaring people, you know,
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.940]   it's like you have to take your things in order and make sure your bank account,
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.860]   everything's, you know, um,
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:46.580]   but I'm encouraged to see people like want to be challenged and to participate
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.220]   in God's work. And there's a lot of people who desire that, you know,
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.980]   when we were going to China, you know, like there was a stirring excitement.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:58.220]   You guys were young, it was easily mobilized and we were,
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:01.500]   we had momentum for like five, six, seven years in a row where we built
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:05.660]   relationships. So I don't think our church had a heart for China itself.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.980]   We had a heart for the people that we met in China because they became friends,
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.420]   you know, and so as a result of that,
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.660]   that we wanted to go and meet them and follow up with them.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.620]   Right now there's a little bit of a disconnect because we don't have that right
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:22.260]   now. You know, it's like the idea of China, idea of Japan. And then India,
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.500]   there's a more of a connection because we know the pastors. Um,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.460]   at some point I think that's going to get reconnected once our missionaries
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.820]   settled down and they do work and we're going to end up like supporting them.
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:32.580]   Um,
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.860]   but we're in a different stage where we were going out helping other
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:38.300]   missionaries who are, who are established.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.180]   And then we were doing support work and then when we switched that from
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.380]   supporting our missionaries,
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.180]   but they were going through transition because they're not established.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.620]   So during that transition period, we,
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.860]   it was harder for us to connect with the students because they were
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:54.700]   transitioning. So I think at some point once they get settled in,
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:59.340]   it'd be easier to know what we're doing, you know, but, but now it's going to,
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.140]   we have to wait for them to get settled in and then to get into,
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.540]   jump into that, whether that's in Japan or, or in China. Uh,
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.540]   I would encourage you to, you know, if you have opportunities,
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.940]   especially when you're younger and you're not, you know,
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.580]   you're not bound physically because of,
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.260]   of children and that kind of stuff to take advantage of that. You know,
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:22.620]   one thing I really enjoy, like what Pastor Peter was able to do,
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.140]   like once he had two kids,
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.260]   the part of the reason why he couldn't do that is because of where he is in
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.500]   stage in life. You know, he, he's seen all of these things,
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.660]   but he can't do that anymore because he has to leave his kids half the time,
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:40.900]   you know? So if you're young and you're free, you know,
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.980]   take advantage of that.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.180]   And instead of just using that to go travel and see beautiful things, you know,
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.940]   again, there's nothing wrong with that, but take that opportunity to see,
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:55.020]   you know, even if it's just to see like what's going on and you're hard for
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.260]   Japan, you're hard for China, you're hard for India.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.300]   It's not going to come from here is when you actually rub shoulders,
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.780]   eat food with them, sit down and,
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.860]   and fellowship with them and they become friends. Man,
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:09.620]   India was such a foreign weird place and it still is,
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.660]   but India is not as strange.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.220]   Not because the country has become less weird is because we become friends with
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.180]   those pastors. So when I think of India now, I don't think of idolatry and,
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.660]   you know, and those temples. Now I think of those pastors.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.260]   So now it doesn't seem as strange because of them.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.180]   So if you want a heart for missions,
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.260]   you have to open the doors to rub shoulders with those people. Okay.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.780]   Let me end with this. And then, so some of you guys who need to go can go,
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.100]   and then we can, if you want to stick around and ask them questions,
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.340]   I'll stick around and I'll just, I'll just say this,
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.700]   like all this stuff going on at church and ministry missions and all this stuff
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.180]   and all of these things are important. I, I really like,
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.060]   and I was just praying that even this morning, you know,
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:58.060]   and I was like really praying that I want our church to know that Jesus that
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:06.340]   saved me and all these years he's been faithful to me.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.860]   That's it. That's it.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.500]   I'm not trying to raise up people.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.980]   I don't have this grand vision of like I want to have all these churches and
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.220]   evangelize the world. And all of these things are commanded in scripture.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:26.460]   But you know, like what makes my heartbeat,
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:31.460]   what makes me want to keep doing what I'm doing is I want you to see who Jesus
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:36.300]   is. Not that I have such a perfect vision of him,
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:42.820]   but the Christ that I've come to know, I can't help but to love him.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:47.180]   Know what I mean? Even more than my wife,
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.340]   even more than my kids. It's hard to explain,
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.620]   but he means everything to me.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:00.380]   And I feel like if people can come to see that, if I can just,
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:05.820]   if I can just kind of like take what he's shown me and I wish I was,
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:07.340]   I was more articulate.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.740]   Sometimes I wish I could write songs because I feel like they can express
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.180]   themselves so much better. Sometimes I feel like I could,
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:19.100]   I wish I could paint because the painters can like take what's in their mind and
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.060]   the heart, just put it onto canvas and people can see that.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.420]   And my way of doing is through preaching, you know, but I, I,
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.140]   I wish my desire for our churches to see that Christ.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:37.380]   And if you, if you love him, like he is,
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.700]   he's lovable. I think evangelism will happen.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.820]   Discipleship will happen. Like mission will happen. Church will happen.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.060]   Fellowship will happen, you know, because when you love something,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:53.380]   you naturally want to share it. Yeah. So all this other stuff,
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.700]   I'm trying to figure it out myself. You know,
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.340]   I was talking to Pastor Aaron and he's like, you know,
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.220]   I thought I knew what I was doing. Now the church is at 230.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.940]   I have no idea what I'm doing, you know, and I said, good,
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.940]   then we can fellowship because I don't know either, you know,
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.340]   so that's my conclusion. Let me pray for us.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.220]   And then if you have any other questions, well, I'll stick around.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.420]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.900]   And I thank you for my brothers and sisters here in this room and the work that
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.540]   you are already doing in their hearts.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.940]   I thank you Lord God that you've sovereignly brought them to our church,
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.180]   that we can share our lives together,
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.380]   that even in our weakness we can cover over each other. Lord,
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:38.740]   we have no idea what you have planned in the future,
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:44.500]   but you've been so faithful to us all these years. Lord God,
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:49.500]   you know my sins, you know, my weakness,
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.780]   you know, Father God,
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.660]   just how helpless our church would be if it was dependent upon any man.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.900]   I, we thank you, Father God, that you seek your own glory.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.180]   And as a result of that,
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.860]   we were able to live and enjoy Father God,
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.540]   all the promises that you've given us.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.940]   I thank you for my brothers and sisters here. I pray Father God,
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.220]   for all of us, including myself, that you would open our eyes,
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:20.220]   that we may see a clear and clear vision of the loveliness of Christ,
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:25.660]   that all that we do may simply be a reasonable response of the grace that you
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:29.260]   give us. Thank you, Father. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.420]   Amen.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.220]   Right.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:42.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
