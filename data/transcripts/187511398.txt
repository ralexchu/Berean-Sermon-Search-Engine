[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.620]   All right, we're gonna jump into the text in Romans chapter 7 verse 13 through 25
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.080]   Elder Joe read that passage for us, but I'm gonna read it again
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.960]   And I'm let me set this up before we get in okay
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.240]   If you came in this morning just kind of casually, I don't want to be engaged
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.760]   Just tell me the truth the application today
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.000]   Is gonna be a hard time
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.500]   Okay
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.200]   Because the text that we're looking at as I was wrestling with this tax and how to present it
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.480]   Because there's so much going on here and so much to discuss
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.840]   that if I just jump to the conclusion it may cause more confusion because again because of
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.480]   what this text
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.520]   contains
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.580]   This is again
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.020]   I one of the key questions that I asked if you again if you're not in the habit of going on Facebook to check
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.760]   Either on Friday or Saturday to see what the message is gonna be and I usually put up about two or three questions
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.840]   To prepare you for Sunday message
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.300]   It'll help you to be better listeners and you'll get more out of the sermons if you do do that
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.520]   But today in particular the main question that I asked is is this a Christian or non-christian?
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.800]   is Paul speaking as a
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.880]   Christian and
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.920]   Frustration with with wrestling with sin as a Christian or is he talking about a non-christian experience?
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   Connected to what he's been saying previously
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.920]   Okay. Now, let me just tell you right off the bat in
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.840]   Church history in the last 2,000 years, you know, there's been kind of shifts in opinions back and forth
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.480]   Early on right off the bat the early church
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.200]   universally the early church father universally believed that this was a
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.880]   pre-christian a non-christian experience
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.360]   it wasn't until the time of Augustine and then the full-blown acceptance of this as a Christian view came at the Reformation and
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.560]   we can we can understand why because their battle was against the Catholic Church where it was justification by faith and
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.800]   It is not by works. And so in that context the Reformers not 100% but for the majority
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.600]   embraced a Christian view and
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.280]   And then it's been kind of going back and forth and depending on which era you're talking about today our environment
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.800]   The young restless and reformed theology has become popular in the last 15 years
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.840]   So the reformed theology has been embraced and so much of the readings that takes place much of the influence in today's
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.280]   Theologians come from during that period of Reformation, which was predominantly Christian view. Okay now I set up all of this
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.320]   Because I know I'm in a hostile crowd
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.600]   That that my view is probably gonna be different than most of yours. So I'm telling you ahead of time
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.840]   Okay, so brace yourself
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.080]   Okay
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.840]   the first service had about a hundred people and I preached this and I had
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.240]   About ten people come up to me and I couldn't get to everybody
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.760]   So some of them are just gonna email me
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   So if that's true, then I'm gonna have about 40 or 50 people here
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.400]   That's gonna demand my attention after the service, but you're just gonna have to email me afterwards. Okay, so I'm just giving you a head
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.600]   Heads up on this. Okay, I'm gonna read the verse versus
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.040]   So if you haven't read it before before you came and wrestled with it, I want you to as we're reading it
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   Okay, is this a Christian or is this a non-christian? Okay, first 13
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.120]   Did that which is good then bring death to me by no means it was sin producing death in me
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.960]   Through what is good in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the content
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.320]   Commandment might become sinful beyond measure for we know that the law is spiritual
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.080]   But I am of the flesh sold under sin for I do not understand my own actions for I do not do what I want
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.560]   To do but I do the very thing I hate now if I do what I do not want
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   I agree with the law that it is good
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.220]   So now it is no longer I who do it but sin that dwells within me for I know that nothing good dwells in me
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.300]   That is in my flesh for I have the desire to do what is right
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.400]   But not the ability to carry it out for I do not do the good that I want
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.880]   But the evil that I do do not want to do what I keep on is what I keep on doing
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.900]   Now if I do what I do not want it is no longer I who do it but sin that dwells in me
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.060]   So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right evil lies close at hand for I did light in the
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.820]   law of God in my inner being but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.260]   Captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.240]   Wretched man that I am who will deliver me from this body of death. Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.080]   So then I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.240]   All right before I jump into this. Okay. Let me explain what I'm doing. I
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.980]   Was wrestling should I have got just gone and talked about the application of this text?
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.860]   Like what is what does Paul mean here and talk about that?
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.500]   which we will get at the end I'm going to go into the text and
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.700]   Go into and really wrestle with what's happening in this technique and probably more detail than you probably may normally
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.860]   experience and may have ever experienced to be honest because it's gonna sound a little bit more like Bible study than
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.540]   Our Sunday sermon we may do this during weekdays, but on Sunday, it's difficult to get this deep
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.540]   especially in October
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.220]   We have a lot of newcomers that visit during October and some of you guys have
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.020]   Maybe have never been at a church where Bible is taught in this way
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.300]   So you're gonna have a shock this morning that saying is this normal?
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:42.700]   It's normal, but it's not normal. Okay, but the reason why I'm doing this is because I want you guys to be brilliant. I
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.540]   Don't want you guys to come to the conclusion of what this text means
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.300]   Because of what you were taught before or simply by your personal experience because you read this and say oh that sounds a lot like
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.740]   What I experienced so therefore that's what Paul must be doing. We call that iso GD not exegeting, right?
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.600]   I so GD basically is from your experience from your culture for whatever paradigm you have
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.380]   You look at the scripture and make it fit to what you think, right?
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.400]   Now that happens a lot of times very subtly without you really recognizing that you're doing that that you end up
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.720]   Adhering to certain doctrines based upon what speakers you like to hear
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.420]   Like I like Piper so I kind of adhere to his doctrines
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.420]   I like MacArthur or I like whoever and then you have a doctrinal paradigm
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:34.540]   Boundaries that were created for you by the culture and by whoever you're listening to instead of really wrestling with the text
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.500]   And so this morning, even though I already know some of you are gonna are gonna have a difficult time
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.100]   Okay
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.380]   I already know this some of you gotta give me more engaged than normal and some of you guys are not gonna be
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.060]   right
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.100]   the reason why I'm doing this is this is one of those texts that if you really don't pay attention and you don't wrestle and
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.460]   Think through what's happening again. Your end conclusion is like, okay, you know, I trust him or okay
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.360]   I don't trust him. You know what I mean? Whatever it may be and you may just reject this or whatever discussion we have
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.660]   We want to make sure that it's coming from scripture. What does it say? Why does it say that what view do you have?
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.220]   How did you come to that conclusion so that's what I'm doing. So all of this is just a setup to pay attention, please, okay
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.660]   All right
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.660]   Did I already pray?
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.740]   Well, let's pray then. Okay, let's
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.980]   Heavenly Father
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.340]   We asked for your grace. We asked Lord God for your guidance and we know that no matter how much we study and dig
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.780]   that ultimately that is your Holy Spirit that illumines our thoughts and
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:46.940]   And judge the thoughts and intentions of our own hearts. I pray father that your intent of
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:54.620]   Whatever response Lord God that you've desired of the readers original readers that you give us understanding
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.900]   even with our limitations our own prejudice that you would help us to sift through all of that and
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.380]   Really be committed to your word
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.220]   That we would not turn from it to the left or to your right that we know that your word is sufficient
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:14.300]   No matter how it is presented. I pray father God that at the end our confidence in your word would not shift
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.100]   So we pray for your blessing and your grace this morning Jesus name we pray. Amen
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.060]   Let me say right off the bat whether you believe that this is a Christian or non-christian
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:30.060]   Let me let me say a wrong application of this if you say you're you believe that this is a Christian
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:36.180]   To think that you would read this passage and say well Paul is struggling with sin and he seems like he can't conquer his sin
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.220]   so therefore this is a normal Christian experience and
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.700]   so to even strive after holiness and
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.260]   discipleship and discipline
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.940]   How can you possibly think that when I'll pass upon himself?
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.260]   This is an apostle a wrong application of that is to think that this is somehow
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.940]   normalizing Christian experience
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.100]   That will contradict everything else that we know in Scripture
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:05.060]   In fact, Paul has been arguing the very opposite of that in chapter 6 if you remember right by no means does it
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.500]   Shall we sin that grace may abound by no means?
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.940]   So a wrong application if you do think it's a Christian is to think that that is normal
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.140]   In fact, that's not what he says at all
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.500]   That's even if you do believe it's a Christian he kind of sets that up for chapter 8 who will get to next week
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.940]   the other wrong application if you think that this is a non-christian that Paul is basically saying that
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.780]   Because you're a Christian you've been delivered from this conflict with your flesh
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.060]   So therefore if you're a Christian, you should be you should no longer have any kind of conflict with sin
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.020]   That living righteously should come easy for you, right?
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.780]   That's not Paul is saying it's Paul not saying that either all over Scripture Paul tells us to wrestle
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.860]   Right Paul himself says I buff on my body and make it my slave in the previous chapter
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.740]   He talks about walking in the spirit. So, you know to live righteously, so
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.340]   either
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.260]   Application or however you turn out one does not
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.500]   It's not a license to listen just as another one is not a condemnation for anybody anybody who's wrestling with sin
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.100]   Let's just get that clear and we'll revisit that later
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.180]   But let's visit
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.860]   Why do people believe that this is a Christian view which my guess is I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hand
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.900]   My guess is majority of you sitting in here will believe that this is the case and the number one reason why?
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.260]   It seems to be talking about a Christian view is because he's using the present tense
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.980]   if
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.740]   He did not say this is what I am struggling with what I want to do
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.860]   I do not do and he's not using the present tense and if he said what I did and I struggled in the past
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:41.900]   Then we wouldn't even having be having this issue clearly. He's talking about a non-christian, but because he's using the present tense
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.940]   That's why we have this discussion
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.260]   That's the number that's probably the number one reason the other
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:54.400]   Clear reason is that keeps coming up in this argument is how can a non-christian desire to do?
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:01.420]   What is good and to desire to obey the law where he says in Romans 7 18 for I have the desire to do what is?
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.860]   Right 722 for I delight in the law of God in my inner being
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:12.500]   How can that be a non-christian in specifically Romans chapter 3 10 through 12 Paul describes?
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.900]   The fallen nation of man like this none is righteous. No, not one. No one understands God
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.640]   No one seeks for God all have turned aside together. They have become worthless. No one does good
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.460]   Not even one so if this is a non-christian
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:33.940]   It seems to contradict what Paul says in chapters 3 that no one seeks after God, right?
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:41.180]   So this must be a Christian again. That's the second argument and then the third argument is in Romans chapter 7 25
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.180]   At the end conclusion in verse 24. Oh, what a wretched man that I who will deliver me from this from this
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.880]   Bondage of this flesh verse 25. Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.180]   And it seems like Jesus is introduced as a solution
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.380]   But then he says so then I myself serve the law of God with my mind
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.240]   But with my flesh I serve the law of sin and it seems like he gives a conclusion
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.500]   but yet he he still gives the same conflict between the flesh and
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.720]   And the desire to do what is right, right?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.640]   Now there's about seven or eight different things that we can point out, but I'm not gonna go through all of that
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.900]   Those are the three main things that are brought up an argument by this. They believe that this must be Christian
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.600]   Now I've already hinted to you that I believe that this is a non-christian view
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.860]   Okay, and I'm gonna give you my reasons and then you can rebuke me storm me later
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:37.020]   But I'm gonna explain to you why and whether you agree or disagree. I want you to know where this came from
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.520]   I want you to know how we got to this point so that whatever disagreement we have there is an intelligent discussion
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.880]   Not like that sounds dumb, you know, I mean like because that sounds dumb, right?
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.720]   If we want to come to the conclusion based upon how we came to this point, right?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.520]   And what specific things that we have a hard time agreeing with? Okay
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:04.100]   The first and I I think the greatest argument to me like I when I first read this passage as a young pastor
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.600]   I mean just immediately I didn't really know there was an issue
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.580]   I thought it was a Christian cup Paul says now I I am struggling with this, right?
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.580]   And that's how I would counsel people
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.020]   but I
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.360]   There's no passage. There's no book that I studied more carefully than the book of Romans
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.920]   And there's no passage in the book of Romans that I spent them the most amount of time wrestling with than this passage
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.960]   Because of this controversy, right? I probably have taught and
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.720]   Studied this passage or this text as a whole probably about four or five times
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:43.640]   I taught it as a pastor and then wrestled with this text and read probably everything I can get my hands on every person's view
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   right on this
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.800]   at least that I I know of right and and
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.440]   my the thing that to me
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.600]   the
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.280]   Reason why I believe this is a this is a non-christian view and Douglas move John Stott
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.220]   And I got to throw some names out there so I can balance the equilibrium
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.040]   Right because some of you guys are gonna say well, I read my you know commentary and they say no
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.120]   So I got some commentaries too. All right
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.040]   But again, I want you I want you to get to the text
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.440]   He describes himself in verse verse 14 of his struggle as a man who sold
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.840]   Under sin sold under sin and in verse 23
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.780]   He describes again his his context of being captive to the law of sin
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:36.760]   Now that is a direct contradiction. The vocabulary itself is a direct contradiction to Romans 6 6 & 7
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:43.400]   He says we know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.640]   So that we would no longer be slaves to sin
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.700]   No longer be enslaved to sin and then he says for one who has died has been set free from sin
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.420]   So he's not describing somebody who's wrestling with sin
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.860]   He's Paul is describing somebody who is defeated and has no help
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:08.700]   He is enslaved to sin and he has he can do nothing but to sin even though he desires it
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.500]   so he uses that language of being enslaved to sin and
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:18.400]   And being captive to the law of sin yet in the very previous passage
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.920]   Says that we have been delivered from the bondage of sin and we have been set free from the law of sin
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.740]   Right. So the language itself and we're not talking about way in chapter 3
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:34.460]   We're talking about chapter 6 right before he gets to chapter 7. So if he's talking about a Christian
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.940]   He's described a Christian in a non-christian the exact same terms
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.460]   If we were to go back a little bit further
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.060]   If you remember what was the whole point of chapter 6
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:55.900]   The whole point of chapter 6 begins with Paul arguing what shall we say then are we to continue in sin that grace may abound
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.500]   By no means how can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.340]   so whole argument that Paul's been making starting from chapter 6 is if
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.860]   Justification is by faith alone and law condemns and that does not bring life. What is the point of the law?
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.340]   Isn't isn't that going to lead to licentiousness?
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.020]   If you don't bring the fear of God
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.620]   If you don't obey the law, you're gonna be condemnation. Isn't that going to lead to licentiousness?
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.140]   And so Paul has been arguing by no means
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:27.740]   It doesn't lead to licentiousness not at all. In fact, it leads to greater holiness because one
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:33.800]   When we died with Christ, we were united with him in his death and his resurrection in his new life
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.420]   new life in the spirit
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.840]   Secondly, we were once enslaved to sin, but now we are enslaved to righteousness number two
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:49.220]   third argument is before you were married to you know one person and by
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.580]   By that person dying you are now released to be married to Christ
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:17:00.740]   So all of those illustrations were given to make a point that justification by faith does not lead to licentiousness
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:07.820]   So if all of a sudden Paul is now coming into this passage and saying look at this life that he can't conquer
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:14.660]   He's still living in sin. He's not just struggling with sin. He is bound to sin. He's enslaved to sin
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.100]   Then we have to say that Paul has changed direction
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:25.780]   In fact, not only is he changing his direction? He's contradicting himself in the argument that he was making in chapter 6
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.460]   So at best we have to understand this as a parenthetical statement
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.460]   That he all of a sudden kind of shifts direction talks about something else
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:41.340]   Which is an odd place to put it since he was arguing against this and all of a sudden comes back to this in chapter 8
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:47.620]   So when you look at the larger context and the argument that Paul is making it is a change of direction
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:53.380]   It is a change and I know it's technical I can already tell some of you guys are glazed has a glazed look in your
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.380]   face, okay
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:01.740]   But again, these are all reasons why I think it would be more difficult again neither
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.000]   Neither case is an airtight case
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.280]   but when you weigh the difficulties of
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:15.400]   Translating in one way or the other I believe that the evidence points to that. This is talking about a non-christian
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.460]   He is speaking again. Let's look at the larger context
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:25.280]   Okay, he is speaking to Jews in Romans chapter 7 1 is a farm speaking to those who know the law
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.860]   And to answer the question, well, how can a non-christian delight in the law of the Lord?
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.960]   Right, especially in light of Romans chapter 3
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.460]   Well, you look at all throughout the Old Testament the scripture clearly says
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.380]   Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.080]   Of mockers, but is the light is in the law of the Lord and on the law he meditates day and night
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.480]   So a Jew who was a follower of Yahweh
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.120]   Had delighted in the law the laws. So Paul seems to be
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.040]   Representing himself as a Jew as a Pharisee
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.260]   Who in his inner being delighted in the law of God?
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.320]   But at the end of the day it didn't lead to salvation
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:12.720]   Right now here's a here's the thing that again may be a little more technical for you to understand. There's another issue
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.520]   In chapter 7 verse 6 he describes a Christian and a non-christian
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.000]   And I want you to pay attention to what he says and see if you can catch the difference
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.820]   But now we are released from the law having died to that which held us captive so that we serve not under the old written
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.760]   Code but in the new life of the spirit
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.480]   Did you catch that?
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.040]   right
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.800]   All right, if you didn't catch that let me explain
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.840]   Okay, the distinction that he makes between a Christian and a non-christian a Christian is one who lives according to the old code
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:52.560]   he's talking to Jews trying to obey the law and trying to get righteousness and and ultimately bringing condemnation for him a
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:59.200]   Christian is one who's a new code who lives according to what the life of the spirit?
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.640]   So he introduces a Christian and non-christian is one who has a spirit and the other one does not have the spirit
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:14.840]   When he talks about this wrestling with sin and the law in this section between chapter chapter 7 verses 13 through 25
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.240]   There's no mention of any help from the Holy Spirit
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:26.180]   He's wrestling with sin and it's not that there's no mention of the Holy Spirit coming in and helping until we get to chapter 8 verse 3
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.040]   Where he says there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:36.240]   That what the law could not do we can buy the sinful flesh God did by sending his own Son through the spirit
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.160]   so in verse
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   in chapter 8 verse 3
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.280]   And I'm just going to read a couple of verses
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:48.360]   For God has done what the law we can buy the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.580]   Flesh and for sin he condemns sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirements little law might be fulfilled in us
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.400]   Who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit?
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.000]   So he introduces a Christian who is
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:13.040]   Christian in the spirit and a non-christian who's walking according to the old code and it seems like chapter 7
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.600]   He's describing an individual who's living by the old code and then in chapters 8 he describes this deliverance
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.480]   We're no longer on the condemnation. And so now we are walking according to the spirit
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   What
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.760]   Is Paul's main point
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:35.320]   If he's talking about a non-christian wrestling with this, what is his main point?
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.720]   Okay, so let's take a step back and look at what the argument that Paul's making in chapter 7. Okay?
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   chapter 7
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.240]   He says that the law was given to do two things chapter 7 1 through 12
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.200]   One is to reveal sin we talked about that that the law came without the law
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.520]   I didn't even know what coveting was until the law came because the law the law
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   Identified it like a plumb line, right and he says that he at one point he thought he was alive
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.020]   But when the law came he realized he wasn't alive at all. He was dead. So the law revealed sin
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.800]   Second thing that it did was the law stirred up sin
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:17.120]   Right it produced to me all kinds of licentiousness the coveting it stirred up and we talked about that last week
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.920]   It's kind of like dirty water
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.880]   that the dirt kind of sinks to the bottom and then you go in there and shake your hand around and just shakes it all
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   Of all of a sudden you realize how dirty and polluted that water is and he said that's what the law did
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.020]   Okay, so that's what he was saying in chapter 7 verses 1 through 12. So look at verse 13 with me
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:43.420]   Did that which is good then bring death to me by no means it was sin producing death in me through what is good
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:49.300]   The law is good, you know that sin might be shown to be sin right to reveal sin to stir up sin
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.600]   But he goes a step further than that, right? So basically verse 13
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.120]   He's summarizing what he said in verse 1 and 2 1 through 12 that the law came the law was not the problem
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.160]   It was sin
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:06.720]   But the law came to show sin as sin and then he goes a step further and through the commandment might become sinful
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.680]   beyond measure
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:16.380]   So he goes even further not only did the law reveal sin not only did it stir up sin, but the law came to make sin
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.940]   utterly sinful and
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.760]   In King James, it talks about how it became exceedingly sinful
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.820]   It wasn't just sinful
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.540]   It was very sinful and it was exceedingly sinful
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.440]   It seems like to me what Paul is doing is he's introducing
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.820]   Summarizing 1 through 12 and then introducing how it became exceedingly sinful
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:46.280]   So Paul is not only telling us that the law made it exceedingly sinful. He's showing us how it happened
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.760]   How the law of God?
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.200]   Came and made sin exceedingly sinful
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.520]   See Paul describes in Romans 7 15
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:02.020]   I do not understand my own action for I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.020]   I hate he is he is absolutely
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.860]   trapped by his flesh
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.780]   What does the Paul want to do obey the law?
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.720]   What is the thing that he hates doing to disobey the law?
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.240]   But yet in Romans 7 18 to 19 Paul describes his state
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.460]   For I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh for I have the desire to do what is right
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.020]   But not the ability to carry it out
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:34.320]   Right. He's describing an absolute inability just trapped in this flesh
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.700]   For I do not do the good that I want but the evil I do not want I is what I keep on doing
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:48.500]   His failure to obey the law reveal just how sinful his flesh is
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:55.780]   Some of us when we were younger, you know had dreams and you guys you guys are still young
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.660]   You know a lot of you so you guys all these dreams, but after a while you realize like your limitation
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.000]   You know every young boy who plays baseball thinks he's gonna be a baseball player
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.520]   you know if you played JV or
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:12.020]   Varsity basketball you probably had some dreams of going to college. I probably got dashed right away
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.240]   You know, I mean, you're not tall enough fast enough. You don't shoot
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.420]   You know what? I mean? So you had all these dreams and the harder you try the more it became apparent
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.640]   You can't do it, right? And that's what Paul is describing
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.800]   He is describing a man who had every intention and desire to keep all the commandments, but the harder he tried
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.640]   He said right when I was doing the good evil was always right there with me
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   To prevent him from doing this what I want to do. I do not do what I should not do
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.720]   I keep on doing and then he says oh what a wretched man that I am
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.100]   So he is describing how sin became utterly sinful
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.120]   See someone who has never attempted to live a holy life
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:02.140]   Has no idea just how far you are from God
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.200]   Now you're a Christian you've heard the messages
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.920]   You've heard other people and you may have you may have struggled a bit, but you've always caved in
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:18.340]   But an individual who's been striving and made every effort to live righteously like a Pharisee
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.440]   Like an individual who wanted to be holy never never watch anything on pure
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.680]   Didn't want to go on a certain websites and didn't even want to go to the gym because they wanted to stay pure
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.560]   An individual who gave all of his efforts to try to be right with God by his own flesh
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.640]   Will recognize just how far we are from God
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.480]   See Paul is describing an individual a Pharisee among Pharisees. So the law is perfect
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.160]   But at the end he realized how sinful
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.920]   utterly sinful sin was
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.800]   If you've never
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.960]   Given everything that you've got to love somebody that's difficult to love
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:03.120]   You have no idea how deep your corruption of vengeance is
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.720]   You have no idea because you just give in you you know, it's not good
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.840]   You know, it's not good, but you just kind of cave in every time temptation comes you just cave in
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.640]   So you say it's no good, but you have no idea just how utterly corrupt our heart is
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.520]   if you've never
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.200]   Really given all your energy to humble yourself
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.240]   to become nothing
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.360]   You just you have no clue
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:35.120]   Just how deep the corruption of arrogance and pride that is sitting inside of you
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.720]   See we know it's sin
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.360]   But it's never been utterly sinful
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.240]   See Paul is describing this Jew
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.880]   Who not only in his life not only his present life for?
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.800]   1,500 years
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.760]   1,500 years of their history
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.560]   They've been trying to keep the law
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:06.480]   And if you look at the 15 years of Israel's history, all they have is failure after failure after failure after failure
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:14.980]   Paul is describing his personal experience representing the community of Israel and Israel really ultimately representing mankind
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.520]   See what Paul is describing is a man
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.840]   When his attempt to do what is good
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.640]   Realize just how deep and just how corrupt our hearts are
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.400]   Martin Luther was a man
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.920]   Who all his life try to keep the law and in fact he wasn't it what we would consider an expert to the law because
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.440]   That's what he was studying. He was getting a doctorate on this and
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.600]   He interpreted Romans chapter 117 that just shall live by faith
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:50.440]   Meaning that if you're gonna live you have to live according to your faith or you're not gonna become justified
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.640]   That's how he understood it. And that's how the Catholic Church was teaching it and
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.600]   in his attempt
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.880]   In his attempt to become righteous
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.480]   They asked him so Martin
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:11.100]   Do you love God and his honest answer to that question was not only do I not love God at times?
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.760]   At times I hate him
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.360]   That's a shocking thing to hear from a monk where his whole life was dedicated to study the Word of God
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:27.240]   And he explains the reason why he hated God is no matter how good he did no matter how many times he went to confession
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:34.040]   No, many how many times he did penance. He would get up from the seat just after he repented and
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400]   to think about all the dirty thoughts that he had
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.000]   things that came out of his mouth and
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   The moment that he got out of out of penance
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.080]   There was something else that he needed to repent of so he made sure he's like you wanted it
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.440]   He lived his young life trying to be pure and he was exhausted
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:57.080]   And his testimony was that there's no way to appease this vengeful God
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.520]   Do I love him? No, I hate him
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:06.640]   It was in that context of frustration when he realized just how deep his sin was
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:13.560]   Where he had an epiphany understood that when he said that just shall live by faith
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.280]   What God was saying
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:23.260]   that your salvation is not gonna come because of what you do, but because of what Christ has done and
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.380]   Justification is gonna come by that faith
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.020]   See the whole point of the Reformation
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.700]   Was to bring us to the point to recognize what the whole law was given for
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:44.460]   Was to reveal sin to stir up sin and to recognize just how utterly sinful sin is
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.220]   If any of you sitting in here
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.860]   Have ever felt that and I think many of you did
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.620]   Because you try so hard to be righteous
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.700]   You tried so hard
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.540]   Wake up in the morning to quiet time to read to memorize scripture
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.180]   to share the gospel and
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.340]   You kind of gotten to a point of frustration
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.580]   You know ultimately with your own flesh
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.640]   You thought you'd be much further along by now you thought you would have memorized all the scripture by now
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.620]   You thought you would have had so many disciples under you by now
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:27.740]   But after years and years of frustration
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:34.100]   The law revealed just how utterly sinful our heart was
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.940]   Just how deep this pride goes
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.900]   The desire and this vengefulness
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.780]   hatred toward things
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.460]   People who don't respect you how you want them hurt gossip
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.940]   Just how deep this thing goes why does he do that?
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.820]   He does all of this to bring us to verse 24, oh
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.860]   What a wretched man that I am
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:10.240]   Who will deliver me from the body of death you notice here the word wretched is also translated miserable
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:15.500]   See again, this is another reason why I believe he's talking about a non-christian because in nowhere else in the Bible
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.580]   Does the Bible describes a Christian as a wretched?
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:26.060]   It's a miserable. Oh, what a miserable man that I am and to recognize the miserable state of mankind
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:34.660]   By his own righteousness and the more I try to obey the more I realize just how far I am from God and
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:42.660]   Sin becomes utterly sinful in me to bring me to the point where oh, what a wretched man that I am who will deliver me
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.340]   From this body of death who will deliver me
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.020]   That was the point of the law
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:56.060]   To reveal to stir and to to show us just how utterly sinful it is to get us to the point
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:01.100]   Who will help me with this
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:10.380]   Who will help deliver me not from the Romans not from poverty not for my circumstance
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.580]   But my own hatred in me
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:18.540]   My own bitterness my own self-righteousness my own pride
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.340]   That's killing me
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.380]   My own desire to justify myself
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.540]   my laziness
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.020]   Who will deliver me oh
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.900]   What a wretched man that I am that every time I try to do good evil is right there with me corrupting everything that I
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.820]   Do the thing that I want to do I do not do the things that I shouldn't do I keep on doing
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.860]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.420]   Who will deliver me from this pride and arrogance
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:51.540]   It is to bring us to that point because it is at that point where we say who?
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.700]   Obviously Paul's point is to bring us to chapter 8
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.940]   is to bring us to chapter 8 because
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   There is an answer
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:08.700]   See in Isaiah as you guys know when he confronts God so woe is me
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:12.180]   Woe is me is the same thing that Paul is saying here
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:18.580]   He sees he sees a glimpse of God's glory and he says woe is me. He's basically older Richard, man
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:23.780]   How miserable am I am I in the presence of this Holy God
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.260]   Luke chapter 18 verse 13
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.620]   the tax collector
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:34.780]   In approaching God he says but the tax collector standing far off
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.140]   He couldn't even raise his head would not even lift up his eyes to heaven
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:45.460]   He stood before God and he couldn't even draw near he couldn't lift up his eyes because he is so
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:53.060]   Ashamed of his utter sinfulness of his heart and he stood before God beating his chest God be merciful to me as sinner
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.540]   me and
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:03.580]   Jesus asked the question who was justified who's right before God the tax collector who stood in his pride say thank God
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.780]   I'm not like these people's extortioners unjust adulterers even like this tax collector
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.360]   I fast twice a week give to tie the everything that I have
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.880]   She said who's justified?
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.460]   this tax collector
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.980]   Why was he justified
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.260]   Because sin was utterly sinful in him
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.700]   He was beating his chest
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.300]   Who will deliver this wretched soul
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:35.060]   From this bondage of sin he recognized his enslavement to his own sin
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:41.100]   Which caused him to reach out to God and God answered?
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.500]   That was the point of the law
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.980]   That's where God brings us every single sinner
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.540]   Every single sinner is led to the same spot as his tax collector
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:01.700]   To beat our chest not to beat our chest because of our generation because of our church because of the people around us our circumstance
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:06.380]   Or finance but beat our chest because you recognize just how deep your pride is
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.940]   Just how deep your corruption is
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:15.220]   So that we can recognize the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.060]   You remember when Nicodemus came to Jesus in chapter 3 of John
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.900]   He was afraid of his reputation
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:30.580]   So he comes late at night so that his friends other Pharisees don't see him coming and they asked Jesus and he has this encounter
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.300]   Well, how do I receive eternal life and Jesus said you asked me born again?
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:40.500]   Well, what does it mean to be born again? How can a man be born again? The question the answer is pretty clear you cannot
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:48.140]   Jesus was saying whatever you think is bringing righteousness is not the right path. So he was shutting that door in his face
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.060]   And then we look at the encounter with the Samaritan woman
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.780]   She's not afraid of her reputation. She's afraid of Jesus's reputation
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:03.540]   Why are you a Jew a rabbi in the middle of the day talking to an adulterous Samaritan?
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.820]   She's ashamed of herself and she's she's concerned about his reputation. Why are you doing this and Jesus goes after her?
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.780]   If you knew who's standing before you and he kind of draws her in
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.580]   And if you remember he says well, I want this water and said well bring your husband
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.500]   Pointing to the very sore spot the thing the very reason why she was there in the middle of the day
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.900]   And then they have this encounter back and forth and then he clearly identifies himself
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:36.380]   The man who's standing before you is the Messiah that the Jews have been waiting for
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.860]   She drops everything and she runs back to Samaria
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.260]   She's the first evangelist that that we see in the book of Acts or in the Gospels
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:53.300]   Goes back and then and then she says to them come see a man who told me everything that I have done
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.860]   Did Jesus tell him everything I mean it was a very short encounter
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.100]   All she said was bring your husband, but she said everything
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:07.220]   But everything she didn't talk about where she was born her parents what her likes look, you know
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.340]   What kind of bread she likes what she does on her on her, you know
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:18.020]   On her downtime what time she goes that she didn't tell me anything. All he did was point out her sin
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.420]   Because it was it was her sins
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.580]   That ruined everything
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:31.420]   So when she went back and gave her testimony, he come see a man who told me everything and she was absolutely right
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.540]   It was that thing. That was central thing. That was ruining her life
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.260]   And he told me everything
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.140]   And he becomes the first evangelist and he actually draws her in
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.780]   The message is pretty clear
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.940]   The application is pretty clear
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.300]   Until a man or a woman is broken over his own sin
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:39:00.900]   All the righteousness and righteous acts that we perform just makes us better Pharisees
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:09.880]   It equips us to point out other people's sins better it gives us false pride before a holy holy holy God
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.260]   We demand recognition for the good deeds that we have done
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.940]   We demand applause when we do good
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:26.180]   But when the law comes to reveal sin to stir up sin to make sin utterly sinful
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.460]   It makes us worshippers
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.220]   It makes us worshippers
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.220]   Not just doers
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.500]   Not just people who do right and who do wrong
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.300]   but worship
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.980]   We worship through giving we worship through singing we worship through serving
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.500]   We worship through pursuit of holiness. We become worshippers
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.780]   You see this doesn't mean
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.800]   again in application in summary and we're gonna get to
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.520]   The conclusion of this in chapter 8 because he doesn't end with chapter 8 chapter 7 he concludes in chapter 8
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.960]   Which we'll get to that next week
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:13.900]   The conclusion application of all of this is not oh, he's a it's it's not a Christian
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:20.360]   So to say like, oh, you know, we don't struggle with sin as Christians. Do we struggle with it? Of course we struggle with sin
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.140]   But there is a distinction between a person who's living in sin who's struggling with sin
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.720]   Then I believe that he's talking about somebody who's bound in sin in here, right?
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:35.240]   But the deliverance comes first and foremost. So when we're humbled
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.640]   When we're humbled
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:45.020]   About what everything everything
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.500]   Salvation comes when we're humbled
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.320]   Worship comes when we're humbled
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   Fellowship comes when we're humbled
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.720]   Service comes when we're humbled
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:06.600]   See a man or a woman who's just kind of given up to their sins
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.920]   Does not recognize what they've been saved from. I
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:18.080]   Pray that as we continue to wrestle with this text that we come to a point where we're beating our chest
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.160]   Lord change these people
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:29.840]   right and that's that's the temptation that I have as a pastor because I've been I've been given a job to oversee the church and
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.560]   I spend a lot of time change these people
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:42.360]   Change these people and I come to this text and it convicts me it can mix me deeply
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:48.460]   The primary problem in my life is not other people
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.840]   It's a sin that dwells in me it's a pride it's the arrogance is the lust
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:03.480]   And until I come to the point surrendered to that and recognizing what he's given me
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.920]   All the other things that I do is for nothing
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:13.640]   This is why I want I wanted to wrestle with you and I hope that as we wrestle with this that
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.280]   This is not just okay. I get this message
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.120]   but the point that Paul is trying to make
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:26.920]   Right. It's not just chapter 7. This is what he's been leading the whole six chapters seven chapters to
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.640]   To get us to the chapter 7
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.820]   This is not new in chapter 7. He's been arguing this from chapter 1 the moment
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.640]   He started arguing this was the argument that he's been making. Oh
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.600]   What a wretched man that I am
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.640]   To introduce us to Christ in chapter 8
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.440]   Let's pray
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.440]   Again as we come before the Lord, let's take some time to pray and let the Word of God
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.960]   dwell in you and bear fruit
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.600]   To think deeply about where we stand not to simply just sweep
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:07.520]   Compromises and sins underneath the rug but to come before the Lord and if we haven't recognized
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.240]   Just how far we are from God in our own flesh
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.040]   That God will not let us down
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.520]   How far we are from God in our own flesh
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.440]   That God would cause us to open our eyes Lord
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:24.400]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me and to come before the Lord and recognize his forgiveness
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.680]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.560]   (explosions)
