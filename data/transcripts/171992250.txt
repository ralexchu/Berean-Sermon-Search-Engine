[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   All right, let's let's pray and we'll get into it.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.720]   Heavenly Father, we want to praise you and thank you.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.000]   You are so good to us.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.680]   You know our hearts.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.480]   You know how easily we get entangled and get distracted, how we wrestle and struggle, Lord
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.240]   God, to stay focused.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.440]   We genuinely desire to know you, to be intimate with you.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.200]   And at times when we feel helpless, we pray, Father God, that our community of believers
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.380]   would cause us to strive together as iron sharpening iron, that we may be sharpened
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.160]   as a result of our fellowship, that our study of your word, Lord God, would penetrate deep
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.080]   into our hearts, that it would not just cause us to understand superficially, but that it
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.920]   would be convicting, that it would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.360]   I pray that you give us fertile hearts, Lord God, as you are the potter and we are the
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360]   clay.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.040]   Mold us the way you desire us.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.040]   So we pray that the study of Isaiah would mold your church, that we may be people who
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.560]   truly genuinely loves you and honors you.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   Amen.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560]   All right.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.240]   All right.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   So each week what we're going to do is each day there's questions and we're going to we're
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   going to the teaching is going to be going down the list of the questions that you have
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.280]   and highlighting certain things.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   Okay.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.920]   So the first section is in Isaiah 51 through five.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.400]   That was a Thursday question.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.360]   The two questions that was brought up was what does the imagery of giving the certificate
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.160]   of divorce to Israel signify?
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.340]   In other words, what is what is he trying to get at?
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.120]   And what was the reason that Israel was not delivered when they were oppressed by their
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120]   enemies?
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.120]   Okay.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.320]   So if you look at Isaiah chapter 50 beginning, he begins by asking a rhetorical question.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.920]   Where is your mother's confidence of divorce with which I sent her away?
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   Okay.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.440]   So what does the imagery of giving the certificate of divorce to Israel signify?
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   Right.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.240]   Is it too small?
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.240]   Can you guys in the back seat?
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   Everybody can see.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   Okay.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   All right.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   Good.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240]   All right.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.520]   So God is not divorces people as some may have been accusing God of.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520]   Right.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.600]   And why, why do you think some of them were thinking that?
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   What was what's happening during Isaiah's prophecy?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.480]   Right.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.400]   Asir has already come and conquered.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.720]   And then there's prophecy about the Babylonians are knocking at their door and that they may
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.720]   also be conquered.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.940]   So they're being oppressed by every every which way.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.240]   And so they're basically crying out, why has God forsaken us?
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   Right.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.120]   So Isaiah comes in and he's trying to answer that question.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.700]   Where did I, if you, if you're claiming that I somehow forgot about you and divorced you
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.640]   and allow the creditors take you away, that is not the case.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.040]   Right.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.240]   Why weren't they delivered?
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   Right.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.320]   He said, God is basically saying that he has never divorced Israel or sent her away.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.600]   It's because of their own iniquities and transgressions.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.800]   And he says, why, when I came, was there no man?
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.920]   Why when I called, was there no one to answer?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.240]   In other words, God drew near.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.880]   It wasn't that God was hiding from them.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   He drew near.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.360]   And it wasn't because his hand was short that he couldn't read, didn't redeem them.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.400]   He said, ultimately it was because of their own sins.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   Instead of sending them away as they were, they were accusing God of possibly, they were
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.200]   the ones who did not answer him.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.600]   So in other words, this is the psyche of an individual or a nation that's being oppressed.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.040]   You know, like when hardships come into your life, the natural reaction sometimes when
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.560]   we don't trust in God is why is God doing this?
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.880]   Why is God allowing this to happen?
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.160]   And so God's answer to them specifically, right?
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   Hardships don't always come into our life just because we sin.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.440]   But in this particular case, it was God's discipline.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:17.200]   And that's what God is trying to reveal.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   It wasn't because of God.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.000]   It was because of their unrepentant sin.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.120]   So the only thing keeping God's people away from God is unrepentant sin.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.680]   And that's what God was trying to tell the nation of Israel.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   What you are experiencing, you're experiencing because you refuse to repent.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.120]   But again, the whole point of why he says this, again, if you've been following along
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.320]   in chapter 50, is not simply to condemn, right?
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.640]   The first 39 chapters, what's the main theme of the first 39 chapters of Isaiah?
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   Judgment, right?
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.880]   Why is judgment coming upon the nation of Israel?
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.920]   What is the primary theme from 40 to 66?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.600]   Redemption.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.400]   So in the context of his primary theme of redemption, he's reminding them again, like
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.640]   this is where you are because of your sin.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.120]   But the reason why he's doing that is because he's trying to introduce to them the solution.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   So the other question is before the servant of the Lord could speak, what did the Lord
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.920]   do to him every morning?
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.680]   So again, this is a prophesy.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.200]   One of the questions that was emailed to me, which I thought was a very good question,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.080]   was how do you just assume that he's talking about the servant and not Israel or not Isaiah,
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   right?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.680]   And the reason why I just kind of put the question without explaining is because the
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.600]   previous verses, previous chapters, it was pretty clear the servant is referring to the
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.680]   Messiah, right?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.920]   So in the context of the previous chapters, it's clear that he's prophesying about the
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   Messiah that's coming.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.880]   And he said the Messiah has deep fellowship with the Father, verse 4.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.020]   The Lord has gone and given me the tongue of those who are taught that I may know how
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.960]   to sustain with the word.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.480]   Him who is weary, morning by morning he awakens.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.040]   He awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.640]   And again, John 14.10 talks about how Jesus always woke up early in the morning to have
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.560]   fellowship with his Father, to pray with his Father.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.120]   And again, you'll see, you'll see, the more we dig into it, the more we see how much it
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.400]   looks like Jesus' life, right?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.680]   It says his ears will be opened, right?
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.280]   Verse 5, the Lord God has opened my ear and I was not rebellious, I turned not backward.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.760]   I gave my back to those who strike and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.440]   I hid my face from disgrace and spitting, right?
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.400]   So when it says his ears were opened, it means two things.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.440]   One, that he was eager to obey.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.760]   His ears were opened, meaning that whatever God was saying, he's eager.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.440]   What do you have to say to me that he wanted to obey?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.400]   The other part of it is related to the Old Testament.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   To be eared, ears to be opened or to be pierced was symbolic of a slave who was submitting.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.100]   And I'm not going to get into that because of time, but in Exodus 21 to 5 to 6, it actually
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.740]   gives instructions to a slave to go back and resubmit yourself to the Master.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.960]   And it's described as piercing your ear, right?
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.300]   Opening your ear toward the Master.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.360]   So Jew would have understood that right away when he says my ears were opened or pierced,
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.460]   means that he's willing to obey, he's willing to submit, right?
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.040]   So the servant is going to come, there's going to be intimacy between him and the Father,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.880]   and that he was going to willingly submit.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   And when this servant comes, the Messiah comes, how would he be treated?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:05.600]   Talks about physical abuse, verse 6, "I gave my back to those who strike."
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.880]   The imagery of the servant turning around, giving his back, again, is the imagery of
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:22.680]   voluntarily giving himself.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.480]   So what he's come to do, he didn't come begrudgingly, God didn't send him and say, well, why do
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   I have to go?
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:35.640]   He said he turned his back and he turned his cheek and let them have him.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.040]   And why does the Messiah say his strength came from the Lord?
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.880]   And I think we've gone through this so many times, just like it says in Philippians 2,
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.240]   6, that his incarnation meant that he absolutely humbled himself.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.620]   He didn't come in his full glory.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:09:01.520]   He experienced all the weaknesses, hunger, pain, rejection, living, growing up in a poor
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.720]   family, he experienced all of that and all human limitations, he deliberately.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.800]   So everything that Jesus experienced and everything he did, he did as a humbled human being, dependent
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.900]   upon the Spirit.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.640]   So in this passage it describes him as someone who is strengthened because he relies on him,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.480]   because he prays to him.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:28.800]   It says, "Because the Lord God will help him, the Messiah has set his face like a flint,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.960]   meaning he has resolved to carry out God's plans."
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.720]   Again, so we see, you see what's going on, just kind of give you the flow of chapter
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.160]   50, he says it's not because God's arm was short that they were experiencing discipline,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.640]   it was because of their sins.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.080]   But the whole reason why he reveals that is to give the solution, and the solution is
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.720]   the coming Messiah.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.280]   So this Messiah who's going to come is going to be sent by the Father, he's going to have
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:03.640]   deep intimacy with God, he's coming voluntarily, he's going to be mistreated, right, and then
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.920]   he says he's going to turn his face, right, and make his face like flint, meaning he's
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.520]   going to be resolved to do this.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   He's not doing it begrudgingly.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.400]   In fact, Luke 9, 51, it says, "When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.200]   face to go to Jerusalem."
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.000]   And so that was the imagery, like, that's where he said he's going to the cross, and
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.040]   he's not dragging his feet, God is not, like, you know, pushing him and dragging him, he
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.000]   was resolved to go.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.520]   Just like it says in the first three chapters of Ephesians, it was his will, it was his
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.320]   purpose, it was predestined, it was elected, that from the very beginning, this was his
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.360]   intention, right?
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.120]   So his servant is going to come and volunteer to offer his life to be abused because of
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   the sins of Israel and sins of his people.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:14.760]   I think the battery's dead.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   Do I have more batteries?
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   I think it's a battery.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   Hopefully it's a battery.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   All right, thank you.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   Which is the positive?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   This one?
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Okay, all right, good.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:12:13.280]   So what does God call Israel to do?
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.560]   In light of his sacrifice, what does God call them to do?
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.400]   He's called to obey, verse 10 through 11, "Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   voice of the servant?
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.040]   Let him who walks in darkness and has no light trust in the name of the Lord and rely on
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.760]   his God."
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.680]   So because of what the servant is going to do, again, you see the flow?
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   Basically it's the gospel message.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.640]   He's saying, he reveals the sin, and it is because of your sin, not because God is not
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   willing.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.960]   The solution comes and the Messiah is going to come and he's going to offer his life.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.880]   And as a result of what the Messiah is going to do, he said, all those who desire to come
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.720]   to him and obey.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.960]   So it's not that because Jesus died for you and took care of your sins, so therefore now
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.320]   you're free to do whatever.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:04.080]   He said as a result of what he has done, he's caused everyone to come and obey.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.920]   So in verse 11, "Behold, all who kindle a fire, who equip yourselves with burning torches,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.480]   walk by the light of your fire and by the torches that you have kindled."
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:19.000]   What does he mean by kindle a fire?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.760]   When you were reading through that, what, what, how did you understand those who kindle
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   the fire?
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   Want to get warm?
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   Do you think that's a good imagery, bad imagery?
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   Huh?
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:46.600]  , I think it's a bad imagery because they're kind of lighting their own fire, trying to
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.080]   earn their own righteousness, whereas God is telling them to walk trusting him instead
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   of putting us to their own fire.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   Right, it's definitely negative, right?
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.760]   Because he's saying what you're trying to do, you got to do, right?
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.440]   You should be benefited for yourself.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.160]   But what do you, what do you think of when you think of fire?
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   Riots?
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   That's so specific.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   Yeah, riots.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.160]   Yeah, I think of riots.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.680]   But I mean, yeah, but more specifically, riot.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.640]   No, I think he does.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   I think of, I think of riots.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   I'm trying to save you, man.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:24.640]   He's not wrong though.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   He's not wrong.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.880]   I think of it like judgment, like a mob, right?
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.440]   A mob who's got the light fire and they're looking for vengeance because these people
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.960]   have been oppressing them.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   They kindle a fire and they're looking for a fight, right?
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.120]   So what is he saying?
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.960]   Those who kindle a fire, who equip yourselves with burning, with burning torches, walk by
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.880]   the light of your fire, right?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:01.900]   The same thing that your righteous indignation, first light it and you walk by it, right?
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.720]   Walk by the light of your fire and by the torches that you have kindled.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:12.280]   So the, so the righteous indignation you feel, he said, turn that toward yourself, right?
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.400]   So those who first be affected by that light, those who call others to submit must first
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.920]   learn to submit as the Messiah did.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.480]   So in other words, first come humble yourself before the Messiah, before you stand up for
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.320]   righteousness, right?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.240]   And what is the basis on which Israel ought to base their trust in the Lord?
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:38.200]   In verse one to three of chapter 51, he said, listen to me, right?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.720]   And you'll notice that all throughout chapter 52 and all along to chapter 50, no, chapter
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.080]   51, 52, he says over and over, listen, right?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.480]   Carefully pay attention, listen.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.920]   So as you're studying through, see how many times he says over and over again, wake up,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.120]   listen, wake up, listen, right?
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   And then he goes through, like, do you remember?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.620]   Remember what I have done?
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.840]   Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the Lord, look to the rock from
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.240]   which you are hewn and to the query from which you were dug.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.400]   Look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who bore you, for he was but one when I called
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.960]   him that I might bless him and multiply him.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.880]   What encouragement is he trying to give through that imagery?
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.120]   Remember Abraham, you who are righteous, who are seeking me, remember Abraham?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.040]   He was only one man and how God blessed him.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.080]   And so all these things, all these blessings came out of this one man.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.040]   What is the encouragement he's giving to the righteous here?
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:17:01.120]   >> To trust God, to trust his faithfulness, to trust his goodness.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.840]   >> To trust God, definitely.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.760]   What do you think is specific of this one man?
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.560]   He was only one man, but God blessed him.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.000]   So definitely the big picture is...
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.960]   >> Yeah, his faithfulness, his covenant through me.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   >> Even this one man, right?
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   Is that what you were going to say?
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   >> Even the Lord.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.960]   >> Right, okay.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:29.920]   So specifically, it's God used this one man to bless everybody.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.080]   And so he said, if you're searching me and you are not the majority, right?
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.000]   And you're coming to God and all you see are your enemies.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.620]   Everybody's coming to oppress you.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.080]   Nobody seems to be interested in God.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.360]   And even though you feel like you're standing alone, remember that God blessed one man and
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.720]   through that one man brought the nation of Israel, right?
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.600]   So in other words, what is he telling the righteous man?
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.240]   Don't look at people, right?
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.480]   Don't look at people.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.640]   Look at God, keep your eyes on him.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   So he reminds them that God's faithfulness is to one man, one man to lead to what Israel
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:16.600]   is.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.500]   And so when he says, when he comes, what will he bring with him?
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.960]   So along with that context, he says, you know, don't be fearful because you're a minority
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.080]   and all these other people.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.960]   It seems like there are more people who are against God than those who are for God.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.240]   He says, do not fear.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.320]   And what is one of the reasons why he says not to fear?
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.760]   Because when he comes, he will bring reward to the righteous and judgment to the unrighteous.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.320]   So instead of fearing them, you should pity them because the real judgment is coming to
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.880]   them.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.440]   And what is the, why was it that the righteous man was fearing the people?
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.960]   So do not fear the reproach of man or their reviling against you because they are the
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   ones who will be judged.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.020]   God's going to turn the table around, right?
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.380]   At this moment, they may be oppressing you, but they are the ones who are ultimately going
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.380]   to be repressed.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.380]   Okay.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.380]   Oppressed.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:28.620]   And here's a question that, did everybody get this email, the correction?
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.620]   Yes.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.980]   Most of you guys got it.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980]   Okay.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.820]   I worded it poorly because after I got the email and I read it, I said, okay, that's
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.180]   not what I meant.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.180]   Okay.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.620]   So basically the corrected version of it was, why was it not Israel?
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.260]   In fact, what is God trying to do and why, like who is, who is the one who sustained
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.820]   the nation of Israel?
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.180]   So in other words, your pride, even when things were going great, he goes down the history
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:57.900]   of Israel and all the things that God has done, he's reminding them that it wasn't you,
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   right?
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.900]   It was the Lord.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.420]   He was the one that the right, the arm of the Lord is the one who delivered you.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.300]   Arm of the one who performed miracles, right?
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.880]   So even though at this time you may look on the horizon and it seems like enemies are
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.540]   surrounding you, that in the end, all the great things that happened, it wasn't because
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.220]   of you, that it was ultimately because of God, right?
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:28.020]   So his faithfulness to the past is a guarantee of his faithfulness for the future.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.420]   And again, we've been talking about justification by faith and how we have been saved.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.540]   And because if God has been faithful for our justification, how will they not be faithful
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.540]   in sanctification and glorification, right?
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.780]   So it's not like he thought we were helpless in justification and then just kind of let
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.460]   you guys go and try it yourself.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.140]   But he who is justified, he will sanctified and ultimately will glorify.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:59.260]   So he again repeats the history over and over again because their confidence comes from
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.380]   who God is, not what they're able to do, not some new technique that they somehow found
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.340]   that works that didn't work in the previous generation, but the solution is always to
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.380]   look to the past, right?
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.540]   And that's what's unique about Christianity, where everything around us is trying to progress.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.900]   You're trying to find a new way to do things, new way to do church, new way to do small
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.980]   group, you know, new way to reach out to new people because we have a new generation.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.020]   But Christianity is always about sticking to the past, right?
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.220]   And I'm not talking about how we dress or the style of songs, but in the end, our source
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.540]   of strength and power comes from our past, from who God is, right?
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:44.180]   God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as the same God was faithful to them, is the same God
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.900]   who is faithful to us today.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.860]   So our goal ultimately is to dig back and to recognize that God who saved you is the
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.780]   God who will continue to save you, will ultimately save you.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.700]   So again, Revelation chapter three, right?
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.380]   Forsaking your first love, to restore your first love, what does he say?
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.900]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.460]   Always remember, right?
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.580]   If you want to bear fruit, what does he say?
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.580]   Remain.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.540]   He doesn't say go forward, turn forward.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.180]   He says, no, remain.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.740]   Remain with Christ, continue with Christ, right?
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.900]   And so that message is consistent all throughout scripture, even in the Old Testament.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.700]   He's trying to encourage these people because of these trials.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.660]   And where did the source of strength come from?
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.820]   Look at your past, right?
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.940]   Look at who God is.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.580]   Keep your eyes on him and don't lose hope.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.260]   What was the primary reason why they were fearful?
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.700]   Because they forgot who God is, right?
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.180]   And isn't that ultimately the reason why we become anxious?
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.800]   Because we get disconnected.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.180]   We forget that we have a God who is the creator of the universe.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:57.300]   If he loved you enough to send his only begotten son, would he not love you enough to provide
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.620]   for you?
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.940]   Would he not love you enough to answer your prayers, to protect you?
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.980]   That he somehow, you know, went out of his way to send his only begotten son, but then
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.220]   he has no power over your health, he has no power over your wealth, he has no power over
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.220]   your family.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.660]   It doesn't make any sense, right?
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.460]   The only reason why anxiousness and fear come is because we've forgotten who he is.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:30.780]   And finally, on Wednesday, what was God's discipline of Israel meant to do for Israel?
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.340]   To awaken them, right?
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:40.700]   And over and over again, Israel was called to awake, awake.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:48.620]   Even in the midst of enemies coming and crashing in, they were relying on their religiousness.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.580]   So the Babylonians are coming, the Assyrians are coming, the Egyptians are coming, and
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.780]   what was their solution?
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.820]   Go to the temple and offer meaningless sacrifices, right?
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.340]   Go to the temple, you know, give sacrifices, give to the temple.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.180]   And so they were constantly doing these rituals, and God's looking at that, and said, "That's
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.820]   not real sacrifice.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:13.180]   How can you be sitting outside the temple, and somehow by coming into the temple and
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.820]   doing righteous things, that somehow that's going to erase your sins?"
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.980]   Right?
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.940]   So he calls them, he says, "No, awaken.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.980]   Come to me, listen to me, awaken."
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.100]   So basically he's calling for revival in the nation of Israel.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.260]   And the reason why he's allowing discipline to come is so that they would open their ears
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:54.260]   and start paying attention to God instead of relying on their religiousness.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.260]   Oh you know what it is?
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.260]   Maybe it's these chairs.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:03.540]   You think it's these chairs blocking the way?
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.860]   Either they're too high or I'm too short.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   Let me see, let me see.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.860]   If this works.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.860]   No, my theory is no good.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.860]   Okay.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.780]   So God's there.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.940]   What does God promise to do again to the nation of Israel?
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.940]   Next one.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.020]   God will take away the cup of wrath that they were under.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:42.900]   So if you look at verse 17, chapter 51 verse 17, he says, "Wake yourself, wake yourself,
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.220]   stand up O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the Lord, the cup of His wrath."
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.100]   So again, when the scripture uses the imagery of the cup, it typically talks about His wrath.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.500]   Remember when Jesus says to the disciples, let me sit to the left and to the right, and
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.820]   He says, "Are you able to drink the cup that I drink?"
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.620]   And the cup He's referring to is a wrath that He's going to take upon Himself.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.140]   And so He says, "The cup of wrath, do you not know that the cup of wrath came to you
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.540]   for a reason?"
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.040]   And then He says in verse 22, "Thus says the Lord, the Lord your God, who pleads the cause
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.780]   of His people, 'Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering.'"
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.340]   In other words, God gave the cup for the purpose of disciplining.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.260]   But time's going to come when God's going to take away the cup, right?
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.860]   The bowl of my wrath, you shall drink no more.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.900]   Even though your sins are many, my servant is going to come, He's going to make His face
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.700]   like flint, and He's going to go toward the cross, take our sins upon Himself.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.360]   He's going to be beaten by the multitudes.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.820]   He's going to have deep fellowship with the Father, right?
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.960]   And ultimately, He's going to take away our sins.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.340]   And so the wrath of God is going to be taken away.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.500]   So again, it doesn't spell it out here, it gets more detailed.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.740]   All of this is a setup for chapter 53, right?
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.500]   And you know what He's going to say in chapter 53, is the most detailed description of what
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.740]   Jesus is going to do for us.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.420]   So how is this wrath going to be taken away?
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.300]   Is God just going to say, "You know what?
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.980]   I'm just not going to remember your sins."
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.540]   He doesn't just say, "You know what?
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.820]   I'm tired of disciplining you, I'm just going to let you go."
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.020]   That's not what He'd do.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:24.100]   If He did that, He would be going against His righteousness and His holiness.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.700]   Imagine if you're raising kids and you did that.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.660]   "I'm tired of disciplining you.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.380]   I'm just going to pretend like you did sin and nothing happened.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.140]   Just kind of like, I'm just going to look the other way."
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.120]   Imagine what that would do to that child.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.080]   If you really loved your child, you wouldn't do that.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.740]   So God's not saying, "I'm just going to take away."
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.860]   It's like, "Oh, you know, I'm so sick of bringing judgment.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.580]   I think I'm just going to bless you now."
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:56.020]   So He's going to have that wrath diverted to His Son so He absorbs it.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.820]   And when He absorbs it, He doesn't just absorb our sin.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.740]   We'll talk about that more later.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.860]   He doesn't just absorb our sins.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:09.260]   He dies and He resurrects and He makes us new creation.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:15.740]   So that His sacrifice affects us so deeply that we become new creation.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.380]   So He's not just simply saying, "Ah, forget it.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.740]   I don't remember your sin because Jesus took your sins."
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.820]   But by doing so, He made us new creation.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.740]   So that He can put new wine into new wineskin.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.500]   Okay.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   All right.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.100]   So for the next about 10 minutes.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.460]   And I told you, I don't think I can do this.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.780]   I'm not sure if I can do this every week.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.740]   But I think I wanted to take some time to worship with you again.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.060]   And just kind of along with the theme that we're studying.
