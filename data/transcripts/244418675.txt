[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   All right, turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 12, verses 1.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.920]   I'm going to read both verses 1 and 2, but our focus this morning is going to be verse
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.520]   1.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.840]   I appeal to you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.080]   a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.620]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.680]   That by testing, you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.680]   perfect.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680]   Let's pray.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.560]   Heavenly Father, we come before you desiring to meet you, to praise you and honor you and
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.480]   thank you, Father, for your goodness.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.400]   We pray for your word to have power over our thoughts, our hearts, our will.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.800]   And in light of all that you have given us, help us, Lord God, to give you a reasonable
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.120]   spiritual act of worship.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.360]   We ask for your presence and your Holy Spirit's guidance.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.080]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   Amen.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.160]   All right, so again, if you've been through the whole book of Romans with us, and I don't
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.760]   know exactly how much time we spent on it, but it's got to be at least a year and a half
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   to maybe even two years.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.360]   I don't know, maybe longer than that.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.280]   But we've been in the book of Romans for 11 chapters, and 11 chapters of exposition of
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.140]   the mercies of God.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.640]   And so we've been, generally speaking, if we were to title chapter 1 through 11 with
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.740]   one word, it would be justification.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.660]   Why do we need justification?
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660]   How are we going to get justified?
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.500]   What are the ramifications of justification?
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.460]   What are the results of justification?
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.300]   And so basically 11 chapters is about how someone gets saved.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.980]   We are justified by the blood of Christ.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.820]   So chapter 12 through 16, we're entering into a new section, and it is not different, but
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.960]   the emphasis definitely is different.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.660]   So all of the teaching of justification is going to lead us to sanctification.
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.180]   How does this apply practically in the life of a Christian?
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.260]   So again, I have a tendency, or we have a tendency that whenever we talk a lot about
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.960]   justification, which we have for the last 11 chapters, I typically get people coming
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.420]   up to me and say, "Well, when are we going to talk about practical stuff, telling people
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.140]   to do this and do that?"
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.980]   And then whenever I tend to spend a lot of time on the application aspect of it, I always
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.420]   get somebody in the congregation who will come up to me and say, "Oh, how come we're
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.060]   not talking enough about justification, and about the blood of Christ, and about the gospel?"
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.660]   Well, we follow whatever the scripture teaches, and we're following this pattern.
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.600]   And again, so for a period, starting from chapter 12, we're going to be talking about
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   application.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.980]   So what does it mean if you confess these truths of 11 chapters, what does it mean in
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.980]   application?
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.620]   So I want to just quickly read again in verse 1, where Paul says, "I appeal to you therefore."
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.740]   Therefore meaning this is a summary of everything that he said up to 11 chapters.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.920]   "I appeal to you in light of all of this, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.840]   your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.900]   act of worship."
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.420]   That this is how you ought to apply what you have learned in view of this mercy.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:37.140]   When we think about sanctification, that subject alone, you could probably spend the rest of
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.620]   our lives just talking about sanctification.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.940]   As much as we can spend a lot of time talking about justification, we can talk a lot about
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:53.300]   sanctification because sanctification is at the core of how the church is run.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.080]   So oftentimes people ask the question, "So what's the distinction between a Baptist and
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.820]   a Presbyterian or the Charismatics versus the Methodist?"
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.360]   Well, at the core of it, there really isn't much debate over justification.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.340]   We all agree, if you don't agree on justification, you wouldn't be an evangelical Christian.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.600]   We wouldn't be able to fellowship together.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   You wouldn't be a Christian.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.240]   But the reason why we have different denominations is because the application of this looks very
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.040]   different from church to church.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   And that's because the view of sanctification is very different.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   So I'm going to give you a quick overview, and this is not comprehensive, but this is
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.360]   a quick overview of how this is applied in different groups.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.280]   The first group, we'll call them the Wesleyan group.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.160]   The Wesleyan group basically is, John Wesley is the one who started the Methodist church.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.880]   So some of you guys who may have been raised in a Methodist church, it is not just a Methodist,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.680]   but we're just going to call it the Wesleyan view.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.280]   The Wesleyan view believes that you can lose your salvation.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.440]   There's a heavy emphasis on human responsibility, and the reason why they are called the Methodist
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.400]   is because their view of sanctification is that you have to apply discipleship and methods.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.680]   You have to be disciplined.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.640]   And so there's heavy emphasis on what you need to do.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.160]   So there's a heavy emphasis on accountability, heavy emphasis on structure, heavy emphasis
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.920]   on accountability and leader/follower.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.240]   And so none of these things are wrong, but at the core of how people change, how people
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.980]   apply the truths of the Word of God so that we are growing in our faith is through methods.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.220]   So the variations of that, we have false doctrines of perfectionism, which believes that we can
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.040]   actually attain perfection during this life if we work hard enough.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.680]   Or we have another group, the Keswick, is a partial view of perfectionism.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.080]   Again, none of these terms are necessarily important for you to realize, but it's just
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.440]   for the purpose of your understanding.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.480]   So if you're part of the group that thinks that sanctification is purely by hard work,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.920]   then we have to apply every method possible to get people to change their behavior.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.480]   That's the first view.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.800]   We'll call it the Wesleyan view, but Wesleyan is not the only one who propagated this view.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.640]   The second view comes from the Pentecostals.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.660]   The Pentecostal view basically says that sanctification happens when you are touched by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.420]   So they believe that there are two separate baptisms.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.320]   There's an initial baptism that you receive when you first become a Christian, and then
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.800]   there's a second baptism of the Holy Spirit, where you need to be continually filled with
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.940]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.080]   And so the way that an individual is sanctified or grows in his faith is a constant filling
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.900]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:05.380]   So if you are part of a camp that believes that, imagine how that will affect your worship,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.140]   or your Sunday worship, or your gatherings.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.820]   Your primary emphasis would be, are you being touched?
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.420]   Is the worship touching you?
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.660]   Is the sermons touching you?
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.680]   Are the prayer meetings, are gatherings?
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.920]   So there's a heavy emphasis on, and Holy Spirit touching, are you being touched?
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.220]   And so you can easily lead to emotionalism.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:33.080]   And so the Pentecostals, again, we have variations of this view, but the Pentecostals believe
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.100]   that sanctification happens as a result of spiritual encounter with the Holy Spirit and
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.680]   constant renewing and filling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   And then you have the third, and again, there's more than three, but these are kind of the
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.800]   larger general view.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.020]   And this comes from, again, not all, but a lot of the Presbyterian, the confessionally
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.680]   reformed camp, where they believe that exposure to the common grace that God has given in
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.920]   the church, the covenant community, that if you are exposed to that, and if you encounter
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.600]   that, if you're part of that, that sanctification tends to happen.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   And so the way that that is applied, that is that you memorize catechism, that you participate
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.520]   in communion, that you baptize infants, and so they receive this grace of being within
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.700]   this community.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:33.720]   So there's a heavy emphasis on church, meaning participating in the church, in the communion,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.680]   in the catechisms, and so on.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.400]   Now, everything that I've mentioned are within the debate among the evangelical community.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.080]   We wouldn't say that they're not Christians because they have these views.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.360]   In fact, at the core of what they teach is not wrong.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.880]   It's biblical, but it's not complete.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.320]   And there are some things, obviously, that you could take it to the extreme, which some
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   have.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.360]   You have the Church of Christ, that we do not believe that they're part of the evangelical
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   community.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:12.640]   You have the Church of Christ, who will teach that if you're not part of their church, if
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.680]   you're not part of their baptism, that you're not Christian.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.480]   And obviously, that is not proper teaching of justification.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.560]   That is not what the Bible teaches, right?
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   That is heresy.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.280]   You have another group called the local church movement.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.360]   Some of you may have run into them.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.040]   They're on UCI campus quite a bit.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   And the local church movement, who was founded by Watchman Nee's disciple, Witness Lee, and
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.320]   they believe that there are two separate groups of Christians.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.980]   You have the regular Christians, and you have the kingdom Christians.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.120]   And so the kingdom Christians are people who are part of their church, who live a certain
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.760]   way, who do certain things, who give and actively participate, but you have to be part of their
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.320]   church.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.800]   So that's how they have dealt with this issue of sanctification.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.260]   And then you have the apostolic Pentecostals.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.120]   Not the Pentecostals, but the apostolic Pentecostals believe that sanctification happens as a result
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.440]   of encountering God, and if you don't speak in tongues, that's a sign that you don't have
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.560]   And if you don't have the Holy Spirit, you're not a Christian.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.640]   So again, there's aberrations and heresies of these false views or incomplete views when
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.920]   you take it to the extreme, which I gave you an example of.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:32.040]   And so it's extremely important that justification part for us in a Bible teaching church is
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.440]   easy.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.320]   It's easy because there is universal agreement.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   The church has debated this for 2,000 years, and universally within the Orthodox community,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.480]   there is agreement on justification, that we're all justified by the grace of God by
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.700]   faith alone.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.240]   And you wouldn't be a Christian if you denied any of these things.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.940]   But the debate is within sanctification.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.920]   How does somebody change?
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.600]   How does somebody grow?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.360]   What is a mature Christian?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.560]   How do you get somebody like the Great Commission teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   you?
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.400]   How does one person come from making a confession of faith into growing into a mature Christian
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.920]   so that they are bearing fruit?
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920]   What is the distinction?
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.160]   Well, that's what Paul is going to get at in Romans chapter 12 through chapter 16.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.520]   He's going to be talking about, "Therefore, since you know all of this, now it's time
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.760]   for you to begin to apply these things."
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.100]   So again, as an introduction this morning, I can't emphasize enough how important this
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.720]   is because my guess is that most of you did not wrestle with justification.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.680]   If you're already confessing Christians, you already knew that.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.360]   A lot of that was highlighting, it was for the purpose of for you to be reminded, or
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.400]   maybe even hone in to be more precise.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.000]   But my guess is a lot of you, if not most of you, have wrestled with this thought of
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.160]   sanctification.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   I want to change.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.080]   How do I do that?
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.920]   What does it mean to challenge people to bear fruit?
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.080]   How do we apply all of that?
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.160]   So hopefully the next four chapters that we're in this, that we can dive into a little bit
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.640]   deeper.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.360]   First, so there are I think four things that I want to mention just in this first verse
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.200]   alone because it is the beginning and it'll kind of set the tone for the rest of the teaching
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.080]   in the four chapters.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.440]   There are four things that he talks about in, about sanctification.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.600]   So number one, we are commanded to take active part in our sanctification.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.040]   Number one, we are commanded to take active part in our sanctification.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   Sanctification is not us just sitting there thinking, "You know what?
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.720]   I confess Jesus as my Lord and Savior," and then, and then rest of it is the church's
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.240]   fault.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.720]   Rest of it is the community.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   Rest of it is other people.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.320]   He said, no, he says we are to take active part.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:04.440]   In Romans chapter one, he says that, "I appeal to you, therefore brothers, by the mercy of
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.640]   God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   See, now he's taking it to them.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.800]   He's not saying this is what Christ did, but now as, because what Christ did, here's what
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.760]   you need to do in view of his mercy.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.920]   I urge you to present.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.080]   That's a command for us to do.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.640]   Romans 619, it says, "For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.840]   and lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.120]   leading to sanctification."
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.200]   So he mentions again in Romans chapter 619, present.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.940]   We are to present our bodies as a living sacrifice.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.800]   We are to present our members as slaves to righteousness.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   That's something we do.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.120]   That's not something you passively just receive.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.440]   We've received justification.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:00.720]   We received the Holy Spirit, and in response to that, he says, "Now you present yourselves
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.560]   to righteousness."
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:09.600]   Second Timothy 2.22, Paul says to his young disciple, "Flee youthful passions."
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   Flee.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:18.480]   He doesn't just say passively waiting for the passion, the youthful passion to disappear.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   How many of us view sanctification as something that you respond to?
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.040]   If God would just take away these passions, it would be so much easier.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.800]   If God would just take away the temptation.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.080]   But he says, "No, flee youthful passions."
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.320]   So what does that mean?
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.080]   Paul understands that Timothy has youthful passions in him.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.680]   He assumes that all young men and young women have these youthful passions that they are
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.560]   struggling with.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.080]   And so he's telling them, "It's there."
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.280]   He's not saying, "Wait till it disappears.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.560]   Do something about it so that's no longer there."
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.960]   He said, "It's there, but flee from it."
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.080]   Not only to flee, but to pursue.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.120]   And sanctification always has that two aspect where you are to flee, then to pursue righteousness.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:15.160]   Again, in Ephesians 4.22-24, the language is similar but different vocabulary.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.840]   Instead of fleeing and pursuing, it says to put off and to put on.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.160]   Ephesians 4.22, "To put off your old self."
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.320]   Other passions that you had before you became a Christian, recognizing that that does not
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.440]   fit into the kingdom.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   Put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   deceitful desires.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.920]   And to be renewed in the spirit of your mind and to put on the new self created after the
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.800]   likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:57.320]   So part of sanctification is recognize what are some things that you need to put off?
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.240]   What are some things that don't belong in the kingdom of God?
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.440]   What is unfitting for a Christian?
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.760]   And so if we don't recognize that, if we don't take time and be in His Word, and sometimes
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.960]   in the fellowship of the church, to recognize there's certain pattern of thinking, there's
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:22.640]   certain thoughts that you have, certain passions, certain habits that you have that is inconsistent
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.080]   with the kingdom.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:32.760]   To say that we have eternity in mind and then to invest 99% of all our week on the temporal
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.920]   things is inconsistent with what you profess.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.720]   So that's what he means, recognizing what is old and to put that off and then pursue
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.400]   what is new.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.160]   So this idea of sanctification is for us to put off and to put on.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.200]   Paul himself, the apostle, who's writing these words, himself describes his sanctification
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.720]   in 1 Corinthians 9, 27, "But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.200]   preaching to others, I myself should be disqualified."
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.680]   Paul fully is aware that he does not lose his salvation.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.280]   He didn't gain his salvation.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.140]   He does not lose his salvation.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:19.520]   Yet the language that he uses here in 1 Corinthians 9, 27, he says he labors, he disciplines,
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.680]   he fights against his flesh so that after he has taught everybody else that he himself
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.560]   would not be disqualified, that his life would be inconsistent with what he preaches and
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.440]   teaches.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.800]   Hebrews 12, verse 14, "Strive for peace with everyone and for the holiness without
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.920]   which no one will see the Lord."
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.080]   Let that sink in for a minute, what he just said.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.640]   Strive for peace with everyone and for holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.080]   Is he talking about justification or sanctification?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.200]   He's talking about your life.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:10.680]   He said strive, work toward peace, strive and work toward holiness and without it, you're
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.160]   not even going to be able to see the Lord.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.760]   What does that mean?
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:22.080]   Our sanctification is not completely separated from justification.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.140]   Our sanctification and justification is really two sides of the same coin.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.280]   So he's not saying now that you've been justified and you can't lose your salvation, let's go
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.640]   to sanctification and try to work hard and do this.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.720]   He says no, since you have been justified, now this is what your sanctification is going
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   to look like.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.480]   Now that requires your work, right?
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.600]   Just as justification required your confession and your repentance, that the Holy Spirit
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   led you to that, in the same way, sanctification, the Lord is working but it requires your commitment.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.440]   You need to commit to sanctification.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.920]   That's not something that you do if you just find the right church and right small group
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.800]   and right leader, that somehow sanctification is going to happen.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:15.400]   You just choose the right boat and the rest of it is just sailing and enjoying the ride.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.720]   Without it, you cannot see the Lord.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.240]   There is no fellowship with God, 1 John 1.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:34.600]   How much of our spiritual dryness is directly linked to a passive, uncommitted life that
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.900]   reflects the world and instead of Christ?
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:43.440]   How much of our weak prayer life is directly linked to a passive commitment to our own
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.540]   sanctification?
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:51.040]   That we're so committed to fix other people's sins, but passively, it's like, well, you
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.480]   know, everybody makes a mistake, but when it comes to other people's sin, you just can't
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   stand it.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.740]   I remember early on as a Christian, you know, it was so hard because there was certain things
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.400]   that I did before I became a Christian and I had such a hard time.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.280]   I had such a bad temper.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.400]   My biggest problem was not smoking, drinking, it was my temper.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.840]   And I got into a lot of fights, you know, and especially anything racial, like I had
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.320]   no tolerance whatsoever.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.920]   You know, I could hear some ting or ching down the hall and I'm running down the hall
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   already, you know, because I would lose my temper.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.080]   So even after I became a Christian, it was a problem.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.640]   You know, I had a lot of rage in me and I would just lose my temper.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.120]   And I remember early on, I got in a huge fight in the middle of Bible study, you know, and
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.680]   I remember getting headlocked.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.600]   And this is another guy who was a brand new Christian and I was a brand new Christian
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.960]   and we were just messing around and then we got carried away and then both of us got mad
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.320]   and we dragged each other downstairs outside in the middle of Bible study.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.420]   I still remember that very vividly.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.600]   And Philip running down, you know, to try to stop the fight and then my other Christian
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.640]   friends were more mature than me trying to come and break us up.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.400]   And I remember Philip distinctly saying, "Don't touch him when he's like that.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.960]   He's going to swing at you too."
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.000]   You know.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.840]   So early on as a Christian, I struggled so much with wanting to be renewed, but it was
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.440]   so much work.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.640]   And every time I would fail, I would be down on myself and it would take, you know, a whole
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.440]   week and then I would wait till Friday night to repent.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.920]   And then I decided to go to Biola.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.400]   The reason why I decided to go to Biola was not because I wanted to go into ministry.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.440]   I went to Biola as a business major.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.260]   I went to Biola because I was hoping that I would meet other strong Christians that
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.320]   I can decide because the church that my father was passing didn't have a large youth group
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.440]   or college ministry and there weren't a lot of people that I could look up to as a
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   Christian.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.680]   And so when I went to Biola, you know, I went with this expectation that I'm going to
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.800]   be in the midst of strong Christians.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   There are Bible majors.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.040]   They're all headed out to missions.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.600]   And then after about half a semester, I realized that they were no better than I was.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.920]   Everybody was struggling.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.860]   Like the only difference was they seemed to be okay with it.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.560]   They've accepted it.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.180]   That's just the way we are, you know, like God just wants us to feel bad and we repent
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.180]   and that's it.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.780]   And it almost seemed like, you know, every time we talk about whether it's purity or
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.060]   whatever, the sharing is always the same.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.660]   "Yeah, I'm not doing well."
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.140]   Like, "When's the last time you read your Bible?"
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.900]   It's like, "Oh, it's been a while."
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.540]   And it just cycles over and over again.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.080]   So people get frustrated enough, they would just leave.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.580]   And I was very tempted to leave myself.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.660]   And I started to think, "Well, what if these are the cream of the crop?"
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.620]   At least in my view, because these are all leaders in the church.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.260]   A lot of them were Bible majors.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.340]   A lot of them were headed out to missions.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:53.860]   So if it's this bad here, I mean, it must be worse on a secular campus.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.940]   And then I had to kind of go through this paradigm.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.740]   Maybe this is normal.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:06.580]   Maybe sanctification is just something like, you know, like God dangling a carrot.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.820]   And He wants us to kind of keep reaching for it and then just be frustrated and then long
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.960]   for heaven and die.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:20.080]   So because I didn't know anybody who I looked up to and said, "Wow, that guy is really living
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.200]   his Christian life."
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.920]   I had all this passion in me and I didn't know how to apply it.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.880]   Until I met my former youth pastor and he said he wanted to disciple me.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.760]   And there was a campus ministry called Little Spark.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:38.160]   And it was kind of an offshoot from Navigators and it was strict discipleship.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.320]   And I met these group of people who were on fire for God and they were actually praying.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.480]   They were actually evangelizing.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.080]   And I joined that group.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.320]   I became a part of their discipleship program.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.220]   And I lived with these guys for the next four years.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.700]   And it was like military.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.880]   Whether I slept at two or three o'clock, we woke up at five.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.200]   We went running.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   We did quiet time together.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.280]   And every night we took turns cooking.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   Like this is Monday through Sunday, every single day.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.160]   And then every night we're supposed to sit at six o'clock after eating dinner and just
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.920]   read the Bible together because we were all, you know, actively involved in ministry.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.680]   And that Bible reading, it was supposed to be 20-minute Bible reading every day, turned
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.120]   into a three-hour Bible study every single day.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.640]   Because they were all Bible majors.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.920]   Some of them were Talbot students.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.400]   And I learned so much from that group.
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.880]   But the reason why I share that story was because my paradigm completely shifted.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.000]   I went from maybe this isn't possible to, wow, this is possible.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.840]   And so I was very thankful for those four or five years in ministry.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.880]   That's not where my life, my understanding of sanctification ends.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.040]   But I realized that discipline and hard work was absolutely necessary.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.680]   And that's what they were doing.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   But that's the first part.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.640]   But it's not the only part.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.280]   That's the first part.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.560]   It requires our active commitment to sanctification.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:09.760]   And so the first question I have for you is, are you committed to your sanctification?
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.360]   Are you regularly examining your heart, your motive, how you spend your money, your time,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.480]   the way you raise your kids?
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.200]   Is it biblical?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.680]   Does it glorify God?
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.080]   Are you actively committed to your own sanctification?
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.320]   Are you passively hoping that it will happen?
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.520]   You would meet the right person, that you would find the right group?
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.720]   Secondly, sanctification is motivated and empowered by the grace of God.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.800]   If you do the first without recognizing the second, you have the Wesleyan view.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.080]   Now let me share with you what happened.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.960]   I got part of that group, and it helped me tremendously in discipline.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   Memorize scripture.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:04.200]   In fact, our leader in our home, he will never allow us to be idle.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.440]   So Friday nights, before I became a youth pastor, a few of us would sit around and say,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.440]   "Hey, what are you guys doing?"
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.880]   He would walk in from his Bible study, and then he'll sit and just...
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.920]   And this is during a time when we didn't have a TV in our apartment, there were no cell
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.360]   phones, and so it wasn't like we were doing anything dumb.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.200]   We weren't playing any video games.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.280]   Usually we would just sit around just talking, maybe about Lakers or something.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.280]   And then he said, "What are you guys doing?"
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   It's like, "Oh, nothing."
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.640]   And then he would say, "Grab your Bibles."
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.280]   And then he would take us out to the pier, the Baboa Pier or Huntington, and then we
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.120]   would just go evangelize for a couple hours and come back.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.860]   He would never allow us to be idle.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:45.480]   So I was tremendously blessed by the discipline.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.880]   But after about three, four years, I started seeing something.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.560]   And again, I thank God for that period.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:27:00.680]   But I started to see some of my friends who were there, who were jumping through the hoops
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.280]   and doing everything that was expected in that group, but we would sit down and have
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.520]   conversations about our passion for Christ and about right doctrine, and there would
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.060]   be a blank look.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.560]   And I started getting frustrated.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.240]   I felt like I wasn't able to fellowship among these people, these people that I really looked
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.200]   up to.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:27.840]   And I started to think, how much of this is institutionalism versus real discipleship?
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:36.760]   How much of this is motivated by wanting to please man rather than to please God?
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.400]   Think about how much you and I do.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.040]   What a fear of what people will say if you don't do it.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.560]   A lot.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.360]   Even the good things that we do, there's some of that.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.120]   The way you dress, how you sing, participating in the church, reading the Bible, coming to
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.220]   Bible study, memorizing scripture.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:06.780]   So much of that, it's intertwined with maybe true motive of wanting to honor God.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:13.440]   Think about how much of our motivation is wanting to conform, to fit in.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   And then we also can be motivated by wanting to appease God, because if you don't appease
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.200]   God, God's not going to bless your life.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.400]   Remember a whole group of people, you know, the 5,000 in John chapter 6?
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.800]   Remember how all of them were so excited to make Jesus king?
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.640]   And then when Jesus says, "I am the bread of life," and you're coming to me because
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   you ate and you want more?
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.240]   But he said, "I am the bread of life."
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.760]   And then when they realized what Jesus was saying, they turned away and they disappeared.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.280]   How much of what we're doing is fear of man and fear of if we don't appease God, God's
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.560]   not going to bless my family, he's not going to bless my kids.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.320]   How much of it is motivated by that?
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.800]   It's hard for us to discern, but there is some of that in there.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.160]   How much of our motivation is superstition?
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:07.120]   If you don't read your Bible every day, if you don't study, if you don't pray enough,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.720]   our life is going to fall apart.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.080]   So much of our motivation is intertwined with worldly things that sometimes we can't even
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   discern.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:24.240]   See, but he says the reason why you do this is just as important as what you're doing.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.040]   Because if you do something motivated by the wrong thing, it could completely nullify everything
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.280]   that you're doing.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:40.320]   So he says, again, the second point is sanctification is motivated and empowered by the mercy of
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   God.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:47.260]   NIV says, "Present your body as a living sacrifice in view of God's mercy."
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:52.300]   Or in the ESV, it says, "I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God."
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.240]   So in the NIV, it says, "in view of mercy."
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.120]   In the ESV, it says, "by the mercies."
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.060]   So if you look at those two translations, it says, "in view of mercy," meaning in light
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.140]   of what God has done, you respond.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.520]   By the mercy of God sounds like through, through the grace.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   The meaning really behind it is both.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.600]   It's not one or the other.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.800]   That it is in view of his mercy, being affected by his mercy, and by his mercy, by his strength,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:24.040]   that we carry out, we offer our bodies as a living sacrifice.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.760]   And that's what he's been talking about for 11 chapters.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.280]   11 chapters to give us a view of his mercies.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:37.360]   11 chapters of giving us in-depth, firsthand view of what it is that we have received in
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.200]   Christ.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.800]   But that's not where it ends.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.560]   He doesn't say, "Here's all that's done.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.620]   Now the rest of it is up to you."
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.620]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.580]   He says, "In view of all of this, he who did not spare his own son, how will he not, along
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.020]   with him, give us all things?"
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.680]   He didn't just justify us and then say, "Hey, go.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.900]   Rest of the sanctification is up to you.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   And if you don't make it, you're not going to see God."
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.560]   No.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:07.540]   It started by his mercy, and we fulfill it by his mercy.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:14.820]   That's, again, in Colossians 1:26, where Paul says, "For this I toil, struggling with all
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.380]   his energy that powerfully works within me."
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.020]   Did you catch that?
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.740]   Paul says he's struggling.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.620]   He's committed.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:30.420]   But he also recognized the energy that he has to do this is God himself.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:36.800]   Philippians 1:6, "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.700]   it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.040]   You see how he talks about three aspects of salvation?
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:50.900]   He who started the good work will carry it out unto completion, past, present, and future.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:56.620]   He says, "I'm confident of the Philippians, not because of you, but because he who began
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:02.820]   it, he will fulfill it, and he will complete it."
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:08.780]   Hebrews chapter 12, 2, "Therefore, looking to Jesus," NIV says, "Fix your eyes upon Jesus,
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.620]   the founder and the perfecter of our faith."
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:20.460]   Again, one more verse, 2 Corinthians 5:14, "For the love of Christ controls us, because
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.940]   we have concluded this, that one has died for all, therefore all have died.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.300]   And he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves, and for him
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.940]   who for their sake died and was raised."
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:37.300]   So let me stop for a minute and say this.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:44.920]   Moralism is just as dangerous as worldliness.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:51.420]   Moralism is just as dangerous as worldliness, because moralism is by your good work saying
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:57.140]   that you don't need God, that you work hard, and if I achieve, and if I'm disciplined enough,
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:02.280]   if I'm smart enough and make the right decisions and manage my money right enough, then I could
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.740]   do certain things.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.700]   That's moralism.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.540]   But at the core of moralism, you don't need God.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.900]   You're helping God.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.900]   You're assisting God.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.660]   But you're not dependent upon God.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:20.120]   See, the Pharisees were very moral people.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.100]   And it was their moralism that blinded them for the need of Christ.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:32.060]   So the beginning work of sanctification is being affected by justification.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:41.940]   And the continual work of sanctification is continual affecting of that justification.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:51.100]   So the first area that you and I need to wrestle with is, do you have affection for Christ?
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.840]   Is justification real?
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:02.480]   Have you truly been washed by the blood of Jesus Christ?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:08.960]   And if you have, why does that not affect your emotions?
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.800]   Why does that not affect your thinking?
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.840]   Why does that not affect your values?
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.960]   Why does that not affect your passion?
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:26.760]   Because sanctification without being affected by justification can easily lead to moralism.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.320]   And some of you are very good at that.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.720]   You've always been a straight-A student.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.840]   You've always done the right thing.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.160]   You're good at doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.360]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   I mean, we don't rebuke you for that.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.840]   You are the top of your class, right?
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:54.160]   And you make everyone happy, and whatever you volunteer in gets done very well.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.520]   But when that is your motivation for your sanctification, it doesn't lead to glorifying
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.400]   God.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.160]   Oftentimes it leads to greater pride.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:14.080]   It leads to greater judgmentalism, impatience with other people who are not getting As.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.280]   It doesn't lead to humbling and seeing the glory of God.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:26.160]   It leads to greater independence from God, greater independence from others.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.760]   See, that's why in 2 Corinthians 3.18, and this is how sanctification is described, "And
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:38.120]   we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.760]   the same image from one degree of glory to another.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.080]   For this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.200]   That's a biblical definition of sanctification.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:56.880]   As we are beholding the glory of the Lord, and wasn't that what justification was?
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.280]   Justification was the Holy Spirit opened our eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:06.560]   Christ, and now sanctification is continuing to behold the glory of the Lord and are being
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.640]   transformed.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.320]   The more of his glory that we see, the more of his glory is being reflected off of us,
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.160]   from one degree of glory to another.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   Isn't that transformation that he's talking about?
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.680]   Isn't that sanctification that he's talking about?
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.720]   Isn't that spiritual maturity he's talking about?
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.200]   He's not describing spiritual maturity as somebody who's more disciplined in reading
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.160]   the Bible, even though that is a great part of it.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.080]   He's not just simply describing somebody who's giving more, who's serving more.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:45.040]   All of these things are ramifications of the glory of God being reflected.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:51.240]   But at the core of transformation is more of his glory being reflected from one degree
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.800]   to another.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.840]   As we behold his glory, we are justified.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.440]   As we continue to behold a greater degree of his glory, a greater degree of glory is
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:07.480]   being reflected off of us from moment to moment.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.760]   So it's not simply about doing the right things.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.600]   The motive behind it, what pushes you towards sanctification?
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:22.440]   There's a tremendous amount of difference between a fellowship of believers who are
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:29.320]   being broken by the things of God, wanting to honor God in their life.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.400]   How do I do this?
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.960]   There's a level of humility.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.320]   There's a level of gentleness.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.240]   Because they're approaching it as a sinner who is in need of the grace of God.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.880]   Versus a room filled with people who have achieved greatness on their own, by their
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:59.000]   discipline, and just cannot tolerate anybody who does anything less.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.720]   From a distance, it may look like, "Wow, those guys have it together.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.480]   Those guys memorize scripture, they do this, and so many people volunteering, and they're
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.640]   all doing this."
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.840]   But when you get real close to them, all you hear is grumbling.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.640]   You don't hear about the love of Christ.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.400]   You don't hear about how awesome God is.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.600]   You don't hear about how they're being affected and being broken by what Christ has done.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:31.120]   No, all you hear are these highly moral people, and a group, is a lot of grumbling.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:37.480]   And that completely ruins the third aspect of what sanctification is.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.520]   Ultimately, sanctification is an act of worship.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.880]   He says, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:55.160]   as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable, good to God, which is your spiritual worship."
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:01.200]   So, sanctification ultimately is an act of worship.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.560]   Now he says, "To offer your bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:09.080]   Now clearly, he spent 11 chapters talking about how we don't need the sacrifices anymore.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   Right?
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:16.320]   11 chapters of expounding how the Old Testament sacrifices only pointed to Christ, and Christ
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   gave the sacrifice.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.080]   There's no longer any need for sacrifice.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.800]   In order to understand what Paul is saying in chapter 12, you need to understand that
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.060]   there are two major distinctions in the Old Testament of sacrifices.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.600]   You had the mandatory sacrifice, and you had the voluntary sacrifice.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.880]   Mandatory sacrifice, you could not come to the temple without it.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:43.640]   If you sinned and you didn't give a sin offering, and you didn't give a whole offering, you
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.840]   would be in danger.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.560]   You cannot have any kind of fellowship.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.560]   You can't pray to God.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.900]   You can't come to the temple.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.960]   So it was mandatory.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.200]   In order, when you sin, your sins had to be atoned for.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.760]   And then there was a second large category of offerings, was voluntary.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.780]   It was not necessary.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.840]   God wanted it out of the abundance of your heart.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:15.880]   And that's what he means in Isaiah when he says, "I do not delight in your sacrifice."
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.480]   Because what God wanted in the sacrifice was not the dead animals.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.960]   He wanted worship.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:30.000]   So in the New Testament, the mandatory sacrifice has been made in the whole book of Hebrew.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.800]   If you want to go into detail about that, go into the exposition of the book of Hebrew.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.000]   It teaches how Christ fulfilled the mandatory sacrifice.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:45.240]   So when here, when he says the voluntary sacrifice, there is no meaning behind voluntary sacrifice
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.260]   if it is not an act of worship.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.120]   Because it is not necessary.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.640]   People ask all the time, "Do you have to go to church to be saved?"
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.640]   No.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   "Do you have to read the Bible to be saved?"
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   No.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.520]   "Do you have to pray to be saved?"
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   No.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.920]   Because all of that would be adding to justification.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.880]   That would be heresy.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.460]   Now you'd be disobedient, right?
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.120]   You wouldn't be a good Christian.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.040]   But it is not part of justification.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.520]   So if we participate in our sanctification in the church and offering, and if it is not
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.840]   an act of worship, it is meaningless.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.060]   Because in God's eyes, what he's ultimately desiring is for his people to respond and
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.440]   to give him worship.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.240]   Sanctification ultimately is an act of worship.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.080]   That's why in John chapter 4, 23-24, Jesus says to the Samaritan woman, "But the hour
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:55.720]   is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth."
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.400]   Not only because it is right to do it, but because he desires to do it.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.280]   Not only because it is written to do it, but because he wants to do it.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.760]   And that's why he says, even of the giving of the Corinthians, he says, "These Macedonians,
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:16.960]   even in the midst of intense poverty, they said, 'Give me an opportunity to give.'
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.920]   And he said, 'No, you need to take care of yourselves.'
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.960]   But he said, 'No, we want the opportunity to worship.'"
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.560]   And he highlights it, and that's why they were highlighted as model of giving, for God
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.080]   desires a cheerful giver, meaning he wants to worship.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.880]   He's not saying, "Hey, we're short this month.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.560]   We're short about $18 billion.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.360]   And let me get all my pastors together.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.320]   So how are we going to raise this $18 billion and get them to do this?"
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.920]   And so I get notices all the time, "How to get more money from the congregation?"
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:57.760]   There's a whole industry that targets churches to get you to give more money.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.520]   And they have all these statistics, just like any business, they have all these statistics
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.800]   that this church did this, and their offering went up 30%.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.420]   Humanly speaking, it's like, "Oh, what can we do with 30 more percent?
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.760]   Add more staff, get another building."
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:20.640]   I mean, we can think about all this stuff, but in the end, that's human thinking.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.960]   God doesn't need our money.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   Does he need our money?
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.600]   Is the kingdom frustrated because there isn't enough money?
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.960]   No.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   What God wants is worship, and so money is an act of worship.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.360]   Serving is an act of worship.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.880]   So again, in 1 Peter 4, 9-11, it says, "Show hospitality to one another without grumbling,"
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.160]   because the minute you start grumbling, it nullifies what you're doing.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.720]   "Without grumbling, as each has received a gift, use it to serve one another as a good
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.680]   steward of God's very grace.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.400]   Whoever speaks as one who speaks the oracles of God, whoever serves as one who serves by
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.780]   the strength that God supplies, you know that in everything God may be glorified through
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.780]   Jesus Christ.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.920]   To him be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.800]   Amen."
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.840]   God's not glorified because we gave money.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.680]   He's glorified because of why we gave the money.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.560]   When people ask, "Why are you doing this?"
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.120]   I say, "Man, our church requires it.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.480]   If I don't, I've got to buy free boba for everybody in my small group."
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.080]   I'm not against that.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.520]   If people volunteer to do that and say, "Hey, can you keep me accountable, and if I don't
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.560]   do this, make me pay boba," I'm not against that.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.480]   That's not a form of legalism.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   That's just extra motive.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.800]   It's just like telling your friend, "I want to go to the gym every morning.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.280]   Can you please call me at 6 a.m.?
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.200]   And if I don't, then I've got to buy you breakfast."
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.120]   And so you're the one initiating.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   You desire it.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.800]   So I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:06.760]   But if that's the only reason why you're doing that, then it is not an act of worship.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:12.440]   Sanctification ultimately happens with people who have been affected by what Christ has
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.400]   done.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.160]   And then fourth and finally, sanctification is a logical, reasonable response to worship
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.120]   to God for His mercy.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.040]   Now in our ESV translation, it says it is a spiritual act of worship, but the literal
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.320]   word in Greek is logical or reasonable.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   And isn't it reasonable?
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:41.440]   Isn't it logical to think that people who have been affected by the cross, that you'd
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.600]   be able to see it?
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.560]   Yeah, I think we would expect that for anybody.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:56.680]   If somebody won the biggest lottery in the world, you know, they won the biggest lottery
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:01.840]   in the world and they're as cheap as they've ever been, right?
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.280]   You loan them a dollar and they come after you.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.400]   Remember three months ago?
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.600]   You borrowed that dollar.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.560]   And your mind is like, "Dude, you just won a billion dollars."
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.680]   And you're still.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.160]   So in your mind, it's like, "Did this guy really win this or is this guy really that
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.960]   cheap?"
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:27.400]   So what he's saying is, if this happened to you, the reasonable, logical response would
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.120]   be an act of worship.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.320]   And that's what corporate worship ultimately is.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:44.080]   A room filled with people who have been affected by the work of Christ, giving thanks to Him.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   What ruins the church is when the church is filled with people who've just been raised
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.240]   as Christians and meeting obligations.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:01.840]   Now, church is any given church, and I'm assuming even in our church.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.040]   We have enough of both.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:12.400]   And sometimes you may be coming in with a, like, "Man, I really want to worship God."
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.320]   And then a lot of times you may be coming because it's just Sunday.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.880]   You were raised that way.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   And it feels weird.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.480]   I'm one of those people.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.000]   I've never missed church.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.440]   I literally need to have surgery on my legs to miss church because it just feels weird.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.920]   There's a part of me that wants to be right with God and honor God, and there's a part
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.080]   of me that just feels weird, like something bad's going to happen to me if I don't go
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   to church.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   Right?
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.600]   And there's a part of all of that stuff is mixed in me.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:53.720]   See, the difference between a church that reflects the aroma of Christ versus a church
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:48:01.840]   that smells and sounds like a bunch of Pharisees is what's happening in your heart.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.680]   It's not the program.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.800]   It's not the organization, but it's what's happening in your heart.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:15.240]   Let me quickly review and then wrap up because this is kind of an introduction to sanctification
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.100]   that we're going to be talking about for the next four chapters.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.320]   Sanctification requires your commitment.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.240]   You have to commit to this.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:28.480]   Secondly, sanctification is motivated and empowered by the grace of God.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.080]   So you have to be in His Word.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:36.240]   You have to meditate, think about regularly what it is that you have in Christ.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.880]   Thirdly, sanctification is an act of worship.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.680]   Are you worshiping God?
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   Whether you are serving.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:48.800]   You know, in fact, sometimes serving in the most menial things is the greater act of worship,
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.040]   right?
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.880]   Because when you get praise from men for something you do, sometimes the motivation is kind of
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.880]   mixed.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.000]   Like, "Am I doing that because people praise me for it?"
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.360]   You know?
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.520]   You know, sometimes I deliberately do things that are menial and I don't tell anybody about
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.400]   it, which I just told you now, so now everything's nullified.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   You know?
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.080]   I deliberately do that and then no one knows about it because I want to check my own heart
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.040]   because I'm always up in the front.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:22.680]   So sometimes I deliberately do things that no one would know and I don't want anybody
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   to know.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:30.200]   And this is not for anybody to—and it's not because it was absolutely necessary, simply
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.080]   to check my own heart.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:39.400]   Because a lot of the things that we do behind the scene that nobody sees, a lot of times
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:44.760]   is a greater act of worship than being up in the front and doing stuff.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.640]   Am I pursuing sanctification as an act of worship?
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:55.480]   And fourth and finally, is this the reasonable response?
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.960]   Is our life logical with what we profess?
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:06.320]   Is it consistent with the blood of Christ?
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.980]   I hope that we can set that as an outline and as a base as we continue to study this,
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:15.900]   that we would get a greater sense of not only understand sanctification, but hopefully begin
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.780]   to apply it actively.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:26.380]   Let's take some time to pray as we ask—our praise seemed to come up.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.400]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.800]   And seek the Lord and if you find yourself kind of passively hoping sanctification would
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:40.480]   happen, I want to encourage you to think practically of how this should be applied in your life.
