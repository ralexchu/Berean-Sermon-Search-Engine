[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   Hello everyone, my name is Isaac. I've been at Berean for six years now and I'm part of
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   the family ministry here and married to a beautiful woman named Elise who I also met
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.680]   at Berean. I grew up with faithful Christian parents who have always taught me and my two
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.800]   older sisters the importance of believing in the Lord and they have always been my role
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.680]   models in the faith. Although I would say I was generally an obedient kid growing up,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.760]   early on I became aware I was a pretty terrible sinner and I would often feel guilty of the
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.840]   disconnect I felt between the ongoing sinful desires I had in my heart and the good Christian
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.800]   boy I was supposed to be. At a retreat in middle school I remember the pastor shared
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120]   and outlined the gospel on the last night and invited us to repent and to surrender
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.880]   our lives to Jesus and recognize him as Savior and Lord. I believe God revealed to me that
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.040]   night that I was a great sinner in need of a great Savior and so I asked for forgiveness
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   of my sins and I committed my life to Christ. Fast forward many years later, I came to Berean
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.240]   after I graduated college on a recommendation from a friend. It was the first time I was
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.120]   at a church that taught the Bible verse by verse and it was refreshing to be a part to
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.000]   be part of a church where there was an evident desire to seek and know God through his word.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.320]   Before coming out I struggled a lot with complacency and although complacency remains an ongoing
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.880]   challenge I think coming out to Berean has had a profound impact on my spiritual growth.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.240]   I am grateful for the many people God placed in my life here at Berean to spur me on to
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.000]   seriously fight against serious sins, to remind me of the hope and victory and peace that
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.400]   is found in Christ alone and to point me back to the joy in choosing Christ over the desires
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.800]   of the world. Fast forward now on my decision to get baptized
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.000]   through immersion. I grew up in the Presbyterian church and was infant baptized and confirmed.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.400]   Although I believe I was already saved before my confirmation, as I examined now what scripture
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.720]   says on the subject, I believe I was not baptized in the ways the Bible describes baptism. There
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.640]   is no power in the water to save us from our sins, that's only possible through Jesus'
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.080]   death on the cross. Nevertheless, the Bible seems to say a great deal about baptism, which
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   means it must be important. As a Christian who strives to be obedient, it would also
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.960]   be important for me to understand it and practice it according to what I see in scripture, as
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.440]   with all things. So with that, I have never had the privilege
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.720]   to partake in the sacrament as a symbol to be united with Christ in his death and in
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.880]   his resurrection, and it is with great joy I am able to do it now. To conclude, I am
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.040]   thankful for the new life he has given me, and there is truly nothing that surpasses
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.000]   the great treasure in knowing Christ, Jesus' Lord. He has been so faithful to hold me fast
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.640]   when I am weak, and I trust he will continue to be faithful in shepherding me to follow
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.680]   in his footsteps. There are still many times when I am so discouraged by my sin, but I
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.240]   am reminded of God's enduring love and abundant mercies. He is truly worthy of all worship.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.640]   I will close with Romans 6.4. We are buried, therefore, with him by baptism into death,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.800]   in order that, just as Christ was raised from the death by the glory of the Father, we too
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:46.400]   may walk in newness of life. Thank you. Isaac, do you understand that when you're
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.160]   going into the water, you're united with Christ in his death, and when you come out, you're
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.240]   being united with Christ in his resurrected life? Yes, I do. I baptize you in the name
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.600]   of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.260]   (water pouring)
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.620]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.860]   (applause)
