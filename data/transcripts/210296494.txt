[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   If you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 9, our focus this morning is on verse 19-23.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.280]   But I'm going to be reading from verse 14 so that you can see the context of what we're
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   looking at this morning.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.680]   Verse chapter 9, verse 14-23.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.840]   What shall we say then?
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.760]   Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.240]   By no means.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.540]   For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.680]   on whom I have compassion."
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.240]   So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who has mercy.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.560]   For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.780]   So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.920]   You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault?
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.040]   For who can resist his will?"
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.760]   But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.940]   Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?"
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.720]   Has a potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.440]   use and another for dishonorable use?
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.780]   What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.140]   much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.080]   of his glory for vessels of mercy which he has prepared beforehand for glory?
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.520]   Heavenly Father, you truly are a God worthy of worship.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.960]   We thank you for today.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.460]   We thank you for our brothers and sisters that we can run this race together with.
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.360]   We pray that you would help us to build a community that genuinely loves you and worships
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.100]   you in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.000]   We pray that your living word would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.680]   Help us to understand and be more than willing to apply all that you have.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   Amen.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   All right, this morning, before we jump into the text, I want to start with a riddle.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   And there's a purpose for that.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.640]   So don't say it out loud.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.000]   I want you to see if you can answer them for yourselves.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.520]   Some of you already probably may have heard of this riddle.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.480]   But again, if you know it, don't blurt it out.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   A man and his son are in a terrible car accident and are rushed to the hospital in critical
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.960]   care.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.280]   The doctor looks at the boy and exclaims, "I can't operate on this boy.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280]   He's my son.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   How could this be?"
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.560]   Let me read it again.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.040]   A man and his son are in a terrible accident and are rushed to the hospital in critical
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   care.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.720]   The doctor looks at the boy and exclaims, "I can't operate on this boy.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.920]   He's my son.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.720]   How could this be?"
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.360]   And the answer is, the doctor was his mother.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.480]   Like you already knew, all right?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.000]   I got another one, okay?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.560]   Again, if you know it, don't blurt it out if you know it, okay?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.760]   The captain is my brother, testified the soldier.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.440]   But the captain testified he didn't have a brother.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.860]   Who is telling the truth?
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.500]   Don't blurt it out, okay?
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.000]   The captain is my brother, testified the soldier.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.320]   But the captain testified he didn't have a brother.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.680]   Who is telling the truth?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.120]   Both.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.600]   The soldier was a female.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.360]   Okay, some of you guys knew, some of you guys did not know.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.160]   The reason why I start with this riddle is because sometimes a riddle exposes or reveals
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.680]   our paradigm, right?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.320]   The answer is pretty simple.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.520]   It was a female doctor, it was a female soldier.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.160]   But when we hear these questions, you know, again, when you hear the answer, it's pretty
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   simple.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.600]   But a lot of times in the way that we ask, in the way that we answer questions, it kind
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.160]   of reveals our paradigm, how we look at the world, certain things that are true or certain
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   things that are not true.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.680]   That doesn't automatically mean that you're a male chauvinist pig if you didn't get the
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.720]   answer, okay?
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.680]   But there are certain things that we look at and certain paradigms, certain parameters
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.920]   that we are used to and we try to see the whole world within that paradigm.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.480]   And so even though it's a very simple question, very simple answer, certain things that we
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   look at look a certain way because we have certain things that, again, glasses that we
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.280]   have.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.120]   The question that we have this morning that we've been dealing with for the last few weeks,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.520]   that Paul's been dealing with, with the whole chapter 9, as he's been talking about salvation
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.000]   by grace, by his sovereign election, predestination.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.300]   The question that Paul's been trying to answer is, how can that be fair?
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.180]   Is God sovereign or is man responsible for his sin?
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.280]   If God shows mercy to whom he has mercy and he hardens those whom he hardens and God chooses
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.520]   to do that, how can that be fair?
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.200]   So the question that came in the previous weeks was, is there injustice in God for doing
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.800]   that?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.940]   And then today in verse 19, he would say, why does he still find fault?
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.440]   How can anyone even resist God?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.000]   If God is the one who's hardening and softening, how can he keep any of us accountable?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   So this is, you know, the larger question that we ask is, is God sovereign or is man
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.820]   free or is he responsible?
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.800]   And obviously the answer to that is yes, because the Bible clearly teaches both.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.700]   The Bible tells us that we are called to repent.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.400]   It says that God tells Israel that judgment is coming upon them because they willfully,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.040]   they chose to reject him and worship idols.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.960]   They chose to do that.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   Joshua, the famous passage in Joshua chapter 24, where he says, "Choose you this day
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.380]   whom you will serve."
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.960]   So there's clear passages in the Bible that say, you are responsible.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.640]   You need to repent and you need to choose God.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.480]   And again, in the scriptures in John 6, 44, it says, "No one can come to me unless the
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.820]   father who sent me draws him."
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.160]   The only reason why we're even able to repent and come to the Lord is because the Lord is
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.320]   drawing us to him.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:25.080]   In Isaiah 40, 12-31, not only does he draw individuals, it says that God controls even
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   nations.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.540]   He raises up nations and he puts down nations all for the purpose of his glory.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.840]   The chapter we're in, in Romans chapter 9, it is the conclusion of what Paul says in
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   Romans 8, 29.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.900]   It says, "For those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.440]   of his son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.520]   So he says in Romans 8 that he who foreknew, he predestined, and then he conformed, and
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   he sanctified.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.020]   And so God is the author from the beginning, the middle, and the end.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.580]   So the answer is pretty clear.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.620]   So if we're looking for a philosophical answer, like how does this work?
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.720]   That's a different question.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.300]   But the question that Paul is trying to answer, is it biblical?
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.260]   Is this actually how God works?
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.540]   And the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.360]   Because that's what the scripture teaches.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.700]   We start to get into trouble when we look at one text and then we look at another text
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.540]   and say, "Well, this sounds more reasonable."
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.920]   And then we begin to ignore this whole other thing over here.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.360]   And that's how the Jehovah Witnesses get into trouble with the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.760]   They'll always bring up questions, "Well, Jesus is praying to the Father, so how can
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.600]   he be one with him?"
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.200]   Clearly he's the Son and he's the Father, so they're distinct, they're different.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.800]   And then they completely ignore the passages where God the Father is calling his Son in
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.820]   Hebrews chapter 1, "Thy throne, O God, is a righteous throne that will last forever
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   and ever."
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.460]   Jesus himself says, "I am," before Abraham was.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.720]   So in every instance where Jesus declares himself same and equal to the Father, the
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.480]   Old Testament clearly spells that God is one, there's no other.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.400]   So the Bible teaches that God is one, there's only one, and yet there's a distinction about
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   Jesus.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.020]   So how do you reconcile these things?
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.080]   That's where we get the doctrine of Trinity.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.740]   There's a mystery about the identity of God, but we present in the doctrine of Trinity
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.480]   that this is what the Bible teaches.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.360]   So when it comes to our understanding of salvation, it is presented to us in both ways, where
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.380]   we are responsible and yet God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:39.320]   He controls, he even raises up nations and destroys them ultimately for his purpose.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.280]   So the question is, again, the philosophical question is, if that is the case, if God is
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:51.480]   sovereign and salvation isn't by human will, why does he find fault in man?
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.440]   It's a reasonable question.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:04.400]   Martin Luther, again, the father of the Reformation, he addresses this issue this way, and again,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.360]   it's a paragraph, so I want you to pay close attention to how he addresses this issue.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:15.160]   He says, "Mere human reason can never comprehend how God is good and merciful, and therefore
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.360]   you make to yourself a God of your own fancy who hardens nobody, condemns nobody, and pities
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   everybody.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.020]   You cannot comprehend how a just God can condemn those who are born in sin and cannot help
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.600]   themselves but must by a necessity of their natural constitution continue in sin and remain
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.440]   children of wrath.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.520]   The answer is God is incomprehensible, and therefore his justice as well as his other
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.560]   attributes must be incomprehensible.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.800]   It is on this very ground that St. Paul exclaims, 'Oh, the depth of his riches of the knowledge
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.680]   of God, how unsearchable are his judgment and his ways.'"
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.320]   So we can take certain parts of the scripture and it says, "Well, how can God be good if
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.240]   he does this?" and then therefore you start to create a God that's not of the Bible.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.960]   If God is going to be merciful, he saves everybody.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.240]   That he is not wrathful, he's not vengeful, so basically we project upon him our idea
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.760]   of justice, and then if we're not careful, we start worshipping a God that we've created
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.760]   in our own image.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.640]   Paul's going to try to answer this question, but I'm going to tell you ahead of time that
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.200]   you may not be satisfied, but I don't think Paul is trying to satisfy your question.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.880]   Let me tell you right off the bat, this is one of those passages that are wrestled with
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.800]   and debated and struggled, and I'm not going to tell you even now that at the end of the
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   sermon you're going to say, "Oh, now I get it.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.040]   Finally, that makes sense to me."
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.600]   Because I don't think that's Paul's intent.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.480]   Paul's intent basically is to not deal with the question, he's trying to deal with the
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.560]   question, but he's going to tell us what we need to hear.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.040]   So I'm just telling you that ahead of time.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.240]   He's going to answer the questions by asking us a question.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.200]   In fact, you're going to see that Jesus often does that.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.640]   When the Pharisees would come and ask him a question, he would turn it around and he
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.240]   would ask them a question.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.480]   In Matthew 5, 1-4, the Pharisees scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, "Why do
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.840]   your disciples break the tradition of elders?
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.800]   For they do not wash the hands when they eat."
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.280]   He answered them, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.160]   Boom.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.240]   You answer me that first.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.280]   I think Matthew 21, 23-27, when Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.240]   of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.680]   these things?
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.960]   And who gave you this authority?"
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.080]   Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer,
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.400]   then I will also tell you what authority I do these things."
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.420]   The baptism of John, from where did it come from?
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.320]   From heaven or from man?
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.760]   And they discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say from heaven, he will say to us,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.880]   why then did you not believe him?
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.120]   And if we say from man, we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet."
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.200]   So they answered Jesus, "We do not know."
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.640]   Which is very disingenuous, because they had very strong opinions about John, but they
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.560]   couldn't answer because they were afraid about the consequence.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.200]   So, "We do not know."
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.440]   And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.020]   Now why did Jesus answer them that way?
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.760]   He was questioning the very questions that they were asking, the motive behind it.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.080]   See, when they came and asked Jesus, "By what authority are you doing these things?"
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.560]   They weren't asking him a question, they were questioning him.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.300]   They've already determined who he is.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.280]   They were asking a question, hoping that he will trip up and say something that's going
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.880]   to get him in trouble, either by the Jews or by the Romans.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.080]   They weren't asking questions, they were questioning him.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.600]   They've already determined who he is.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.680]   They were in the seat of judgment, and Jesus is the one being judged.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.660]   And that's the reason why he flips the question around and asks you.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.980]   You judge me, but now I'm going to ask you.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.860]   You answer this first.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.860]   Paul's going to answer, or at least attempt to deal with this question.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.780]   He's going to ask four questions.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.000]   One, "But who are you, old man, to answer back to God?"
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Question number one.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.160]   Two and three are kind of related, and I'm going to deal with that together.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.960]   Number two is, "Well, what does Molded say to the Molder?
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.760]   'Why have you made me like this?'"
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.000]   Third, "Has a potter knolled right over the clay to make out the same lump, one vessel
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.720]   for honored use and another for dishonorable use?"
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.240]   And four, long-winded question, "What if?"
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.240]   What if?
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.760]   And again, remember that this is in the form of a question.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.920]   He's not making a statement.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   What if?
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.660]   "God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.560]   vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order to make known the riches of his glory
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.600]   for vessels of mercy which he had prepared beforehand for glory.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:11.680]   Even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles."
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.360]   Now why does he try to answer this question by asking a question?
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.000]   If you notice, the question that is asked is, "Why does he still find for?"
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.080]   For who can resist his will?
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.600]   And he says, "Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.760]   Paul is not saying, and God is not saying, "How dare you ask me any question?"
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.320]   Some people, you know, very genuine Christians are afraid to ask questions because you think
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.640]   you're not supposed to ask questions.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.880]   Jesus says, "You shall not test the Lord your God, so I better not ask any questions."
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.600]   So some people think a good Christian just sucks it up.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   This doesn't make sense.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.640]   I learned this thing in science and I don't know how this fits and you're not allowed
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.040]   to ask questions, which is absolutely false.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   How do you grow?
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.520]   How do you mature?
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.680]   See, Paul is not saying, "Don't ask any question."
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:14.600]   If you look at the heart of the way he answers it, "But who are you, O man, to answer back
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.220]   to God?
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.120]   Why did you make me like this?"
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.000]   He's dealing with the heart of the person asking the question, who is sitting in the
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.800]   seat of judgment against God.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.960]   "God, you don't make sense.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.480]   What you told me doesn't make sense."
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:36.080]   So either you, God, are unfair or what Paul is saying is untrue.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.040]   And both are false.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.840]   He first and foremost addresses the issue of the man coming before God.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.160]   Did God ever say, "You're not allowed to ask any questions because I'm God."
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:16:01.480]   Honestly, some of the most challenging areas where I grew in my faith was because I had
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:09.000]   questions and I kept on asking about the Trinity, about salvation, about the gospel.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.360]   I'm a very curious person so if I get stuck on something, I can't let it go.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.800]   I remember my Bible study leaders would be frustrated because if I had a question, I
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.520]   mean, I just, even if there was no answer, I would just keep asking and asking and asking
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.520]   until it made sense to me, whether there was an answer or not an answer.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.680]   I would never discourage anybody from asking questions, but that's not what Paul is saying
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   here.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.040]   Do you remember when Jesus goes up to the wilderness and he gets tested on the third
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   test?
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.520]   Satan says, "If you really are the Son of God, why don't you jump off this temple and
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.120]   his angels are going to come, he's going to protect you, prove yourself."
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.840]   Jesus responds to that question by quoting Deuteronomy 6.16 and it is said, "You shall
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.960]   not put the Lord your God to the test."
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.600]   If you look at the fuller text in Deuteronomy 6.16, it's specifically referring to an event
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.080]   that happened in Marah.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.640]   Well, the nation of Israel, God leads them out into the desert and they ran out of water
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:12.720]   and they were saying, "Why did God bring us out here to die of thirst?"
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.040]   So the testing that he's referring to is the grumbling and complaining before God,
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.760]   questioning God's goodness.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.840]   You brought us out here and all this was a trick and now you're going to cause us to
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.160]   die of thirst.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.680]   He wasn't saying, "Don't ask me any questions."
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:36.360]   In fact, in Malachi 3.10, God actually tells the nation of Israel, "Test me."
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.580]   Malachi 3.10, it says, "Bring the full tithes into the storehouse that there may be food
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.840]   in my house and thereby put me to the test."
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.360]   He said, "Test me with your tithe."
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.600]   He said to the Lord of hosts, "If I will not open the windows of heaven for you and
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.320]   pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need."
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.120]   When the scripture says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:04.440]   be added unto you," our obedience to that, in a way, is testing God's goodness.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.820]   Is he a God who is faithful to his promises?
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.800]   So first and foremost, he's not dealing with saying, "Well, that's not a question you
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   can ever ask."
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.000]   He said, "Do you understand who God is?"
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.240]   And that leads to the second question.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.760]   "Will what is molded say to its molder, 'Why have you made me like this?
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.660]   Has the potter no right over the clay to make out the same lump one vessel for honored use
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.000]   and another dishonorable use?'"
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Repeatedly over and over again in the scripture, we are described as clay and he's the potter.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.800]   Now sometimes we're described as sheep and he's the shepherd, right?
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.340]   And we're the body and he is the head.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.040]   But one of the images that is repeated, especially in the Old Testament, is that we are clay
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.840]   and he is the potter.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.560]   Now I want you to sit back and take a look at, think about what that illustration is
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.280]   telling us.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.480]   A clay basically is a lump of dirt, right?
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.680]   Absolutely worthless.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   Until the potter chooses to make something of it.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.360]   So when we think about the clay and he is the potter, he chooses to make the pot, make
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.200]   this lump of clay useful for something.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.160]   But until the master potter picks it up and chooses it for his purpose, it is just dirt.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.600]   It is absolutely worthless.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.400]   So what this imagery is trying to teach first and foremost, do not understand that you're
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.080]   just dirt.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.840]   So before you get even offended by this illustration, he said, "Before I can even attempt to answer
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:49.080]   this question, you need to first understand who you are."
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:57.020]   Now for an unconverted person, that may sound offensive.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.080]   Because an unconverted person, he himself is at the center of the universe.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.220]   All he wills and purposes is about him.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:11.080]   So to have the God of the universe say, "You are clay and I am the potter," is offensive.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.080]   Because that's not true.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.400]   It contradicts everything that he pursues.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.640]   He is at the point of glory.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.160]   He stands and he lives for the purpose of glorifying himself.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.400]   So when God shows up and he says, "No, you're just clay and I am the potter," it is offensive.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:33.360]   But to a converted man who has met Christ, our core relationship with God begins when
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.160]   we recognize that this is true.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:42.520]   When we recognize that we are clay and he is the potter, and that we have offended this
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:49.700]   holy God, and then we come and we humble ourselves and we repent of this sin and we surrender
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.640]   our lives to the maker.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.560]   That's when salvation, that's when life begins.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.080]   So when Paul says, "Do you not realize that you are the clay and he is the potter," he
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.700]   first and foremost is reorienting.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:08.200]   The question in itself has to be asked in the context of a clay and the maker.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.900]   So if you understand that, do you understand what you are asking?
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.140]   That you are the clay questioning the maker.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.420]   Why are you making me like this?
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.120]   And again, he's turning the table around and asking, "Do you know who you are?
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   Do you know who I am?"
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.620]   And again, up to this point, he hasn't even dealt with the question.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.800]   He's questioning the questioner.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.580]   We see the same line of thinking when he deals with Job.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:42.540]   Job was targeted with suffering because he is righteous, and horrendous thing.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.100]   We can't even begin to imagine the suffering that this man went through.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.860]   Not only all the physical and the illness and losing of his children and all of that,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.280]   on top of that, every one of his friends.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.660]   In three separate cycles, they come to him and say, "Job, confess your sin.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.300]   There has to be something that you've done.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.980]   God doesn't do this to righteous people."
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.540]   Because that was their paradigm.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.860]   And over and over again, one by one, all of his friends come and say, "Job, you're
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.300]   hiding something from us.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.820]   This is not happening to a righteous person.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.700]   There must be something wrong with you."
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.140]   And in the beginning, Job was very benevolent.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.260]   "God's going to vindicate me.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.700]   There's nothing that I am aware of that I need to repent of."
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.780]   But by the end of the book of Job, it starts to get to Job.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.740]   And he begins to cry out to God.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.020]   "Why are you doing this to me?"
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.500]   And he begins to question his justice.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.340]   "I've done nothing wrong that I'm aware of.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.920]   God, I thought you were a fair man, fair God.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.460]   And why are you doing this to me?"
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.820]   And then finally, when he gets to his breaking point, God shows up.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:50.100]   In Job chapter 38, beginning verse 1, this is how God deals with his question.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:56.420]   "Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, 'Who is this that darkens counsel
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.900]   by words without knowledge?
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.420]   Dress for action like a man, and I will question you, and you make it known to me.'"
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.740]   In other words, you're judging me, you're questioning me, and you have no idea what
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.940]   you're talking about.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:16.420]   And then he begins four chapters, right, three and a half chapters of questioning him.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.580]   And this is how he questions.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.060]   "Job, you're questioning me, thinking that you know what you're talking about.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.100]   Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.300]   Tell me, if you have understanding, who determined its measurements?
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.220]   Surely you know.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.380]   Or who stretched out the line upon it?
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.660]   On what were its bases sunk?
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.660]   Or who laid its cornerstone?
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.600]   When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.180]   Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb?
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.620]   When I made clouds its garments and its thick darkness, its swaddling band, and prescribed
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.980]   limits for it, and set bars and doors, and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.740]   and here shall your proud waves be stayed.'
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.100]   Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.580]   place?
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.760]   That it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.700]   It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.580]   From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken."
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.820]   And he does this for three chapters, three and a half chapters.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.220]   Do you know the way of the gazelle?
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.380]   Do you know when a child is born?
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.040]   Do you know the way of a mother?
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.740]   And he goes on and on and on.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.540]   Basically he's saying, do you have any idea who I am?
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.500]   And do you have any idea of what it is that you are asking?
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.020]   See, God is not saying this just to kind of put him in his place.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.020]   Right?
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.860]   Joe, you're nothing.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.220]   I'm everything and you're nothing.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.380]   And you just stay there.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.720]   Okay?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:56.580]   How do you answer a child's question that he would not even begin to understand?
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.300]   Say you have a third grader.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.980]   You know, I got a third grader at home and he asked, you know, a calculus question.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.340]   Not that I can answer it.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.720]   But let's say he asked a calculus question and he's barely doing multiplication.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.620]   And he demands an answer.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.620]   I don't get it.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.780]   I have to know.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.540]   If you don't, if you can't answer me, maybe you don't know.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:24.700]   The only way that I can answer that child is to remind him what he does not know.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.020]   Correct?
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.860]   It's not because I don't know.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.500]   I could answer you, but you have no idea.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.860]   I can begin to answer you, but from step one, you're not going to know what I'm talking
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.860]   about.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:44.580]   So the only way that I can satisfy him is to show him what he does not know.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.500]   You're putting me in a judgment seat and basically saying I'm judging you and I'm going to decide
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.500]   whether you're fair or not.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   This sounds fair.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.500]   This doesn't sound fair.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   But do you have any idea?
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.100]   You have no control over when you are born or when you die.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.780]   You have no idea of the animals.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.180]   You have no idea how the earth started or how it's going to end.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.100]   You have no idea why the sun comes up, why the sun goes up.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.260]   You have no idea.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.060]   And you have no control over any of these things.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.180]   And yet you're going to come and you're going to judge me.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:23.300]   Job, after hearing four chapters of God just revealing to him who he is.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.260]   God never directly answers this question.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.500]   He doesn't say all of this happened because of this.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.260]   And a lot of times we read the book of Job superficially.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.180]   We get to the end and he says, oh, his possessions were multiplied.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.220]   He had so many children.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.220]   We look at that.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.660]   We read that as how can that be the purpose?
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.060]   I took two of your kids and now I gave you four.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.140]   Yes.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.900]   You had 100 cattle and at the end you had 200 cattle.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.380]   That's why you suffered.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.460]   Who would want that?
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.620]   I'd rather keep my 100.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.540]   But that wasn't the answer.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.020]   And he never actually ever even answers that question.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:06.820]   He just shows up and he basically tells him, you have no idea.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.100]   And God reveals himself to Job and this is how Job responds in Job 42, 1 through 6.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.980]   That Job answered the Lord and said, I know that you can do all things and that no purpose
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.440]   of yours can be thwarted.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.340]   Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.140]   Basically, I mean, it's a rhetorical question.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.140]   It was me.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.140]   Right?
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.900]   Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.500]   Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.900]   Things too wonderful for me which I did not know.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.940]   Here and I will speak and I will question you and you make it known to me.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.860]   I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear but now my eyes see you.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:46.040]   Therefore I despise myself and repent and in dust and ashes.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.380]   He was the one shaking his finger at God.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.700]   Why are you doing this to me?
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.100]   How can you be just?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.540]   What did I do wrong?
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.660]   And after he meets God, he says, I despise myself.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.140]   And he's the one who repents.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:03.700]   He's the one who says, now I'm dust and ashes.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.820]   We may look at that on the surface and again, an unconverted person will look at the book
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:15.300]   of Job and if you study it carefully, he said, well, God seems like a vengeful God.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:21.380]   He's toying with Job, his emotions, his children, his wealth.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.420]   All for what reason?
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.980]   Because Satan just said, well, you know, like you didn't give me a chance.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.740]   If you take away your hedge of protection, we'll go at him.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.500]   It all seems like some play, some joke.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:39.500]   An unconverted person who have not experienced the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ may
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.540]   look at that and all they see is on the surface.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.900]   But Job, he encounters God and he is satisfied.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.880]   God doesn't explain himself.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.100]   He doesn't reveal himself, the details of his plan.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.500]   He just says, you do not have the ability to know.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.940]   You don't have the ability to know.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:06.580]   Now, again, our human psyche may hear that and say, well, I'm still not satisfied.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:12.340]   Before we approach God, every single one of us has to come to a point where we understand
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.380]   just how feeble we are.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.320]   We can't understand anything in scripture.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.780]   Anything that God says, the gospel itself will not make any sense until we recognize
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:28.040]   that we are sinners in need of his mercy.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.800]   Even the way we judge ourselves, right?
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.180]   Every time you come, you know, we always talk about, oh, we shouldn't judge each other.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.500]   We judge each other all the time.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.980]   We judge each other in the way that we look.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.240]   We judge each other in the way our hairstyle.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.380]   Somebody came to Bible study late, we judge them, right?
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.900]   We judge if they serve the church or don't serve the church, if they clean, don't clean,
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.900]   pick up trash, whatever.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.380]   The kind of car you drive, we judge everybody.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.920]   But we don't know the details.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.060]   We just see what we see.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:05.700]   Because from my perspective, this is what it seems like is happening.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:12.740]   From God's perspective, God is orchestrating human history.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:18.420]   Everything that is happening in human history, he's orchestrating to make it fit.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.020]   How is he going to explain to us that what happened to you last Tuesday is going to affect
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.180]   somebody at your work, and then that may affect his family, and then that may eventually lead
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.300]   to somebody coming to Christ, and they're going to preach the gospel in Syria, and the
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.460]   revival is going to break out 40 years later.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.380]   And everything that happened here is going to be somehow connected to that, and this
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.420]   is what's going to happen.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.660]   How is he going to explain that?
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.180]   How are we going to comprehend that?
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.400]   Everything God is doing, our sovereign God is doing, he's, all of these things are working
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.620]   together for good.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.340]   We all know what's been happening in the Middle East.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.320]   ISIS has come in and persecution and Christians, at least the years that I've lived, I've never
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.140]   seen anything like it.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.460]   Christians literally being chased out of their homes, churches being burned down, and it's
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.460]   not in isolation in one area.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.260]   This is happening everywhere.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.580]   A couple years ago, people would have looked at that and said, "God, why are you doing
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.620]   this?"
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.780]   Because all we see is the suffering.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.300]   Why are you allowing your children to experience this horrendousness?
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:27.780]   And having parents watch their children being burned alive, because that's all we see.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.500]   But we've been hearing news from the Middle East, from the mission groups, that there's
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:38.700]   a revival breaking out among the Muslims that we haven't seen in modern history.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.420]   A lot like what we saw in the early church, in the Colosseum.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.520]   One Christian would be torn apart by the lions and two people on the stand would convert
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.140]   because of what they're seeing.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.740]   That's what's happening in the Middle East right now.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:58.180]   In one sense, horrible events are taking place against Christians, and yet God is orchestrating
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.220]   all of this to bring people to Christ.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.120]   We don't have the ability to comprehend what God is doing, why He's doing it, and how that's
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.660]   going to affect the larger picture.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.340]   All we see is, "How does that affect me?
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.060]   What does that have to do with me?"
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:21.140]   God may be using me for noble purposes, to be sacrificed for a larger purpose.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:26.900]   But we judge everything based upon, "How does that affect me?"
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.060]   Because we're the center of the universe.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.220]   Because all things are made for me.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.820]   The third and final answer, I think, whether we are satisfied with this or not, is the
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.100]   truth.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.260]   The third question he asks is, "What if God, desiring to show His wrath and to make known
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.340]   His power, has endured with much patient vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.620]   to make known the riches of His glory for the vessels of mercy which He has prepared
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.120]   beforehand for glory?"
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.120]   What is his answer?
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:06.420]   He said, "God dealt patiently to demonstrate His wrath and His power.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:13.240]   He was patient in judging them in order that those who are prepared for mercy may see His
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   glory."
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.840]   What is the ultimate purpose of everything that He does?
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.720]   It's for His glory.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:30.680]   Now as I said before, if you're unconverted and you've never tasted the goodness of God,
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.280]   maybe you faked it all this time.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.240]   You've never really seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   What God says, what Paul says in this passage, may disturb you.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.120]   You want me to worship a God who allows people to suffer for His glory?
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.520]   How can that be fair?
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.760]   That doesn't seem right.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.160]   That He is unjust.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.400]   He's unjust for doing what He's doing.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:03.640]   He's unjust for condemning people who He hardened their heart.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.440]   Again, we talked about that last week.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.440]   All that Paul is saying in this passage is in response to what he said at the end of
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.800]   verse 18 when he says, "He has mercy on whom He has mercy and He hardens whom He wills."
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.680]   And he's specifically in that context referring to Pharaoh.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:28.640]   So when he's talking about here how he was dealt patiently, those who have been prepared
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.780]   for wrath, the immediate context is talking about Pharaoh.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.040]   So let's look at Pharaoh and what he's referring to.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.200]   God shows up and He's about to deliver the nation of Israel.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.760]   And He goes through this drama of these ten plagues.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.600]   Now why does He go through these ten plague drama?
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.840]   He could have just said, "Squashed.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   Now get out.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   Go worship me."
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.360]   In fact, He prophesied that if you go there and tell them that He's going to harden His
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.200]   heart and God says He's going to harden Pharaoh's heart, Pharaoh's going to harden His heart,
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.360]   and He goes through this drama of nine plagues.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.640]   And each one He shows His power.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.160]   And it isn't until the tenth plague where He finally does His final act and they're
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.640]   delivered.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.540]   Why even go through all of them?
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.120]   Why not just the final plague to begin with and just be done with it?
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:28.320]   Each one of those plagues represented a God in Egypt.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.080]   And so what God was doing was demonstrating His power and His wrath over these idols that
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:39.320]   God is much more powerful than anything that Egypt was using against them.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.640]   So He says, He was demonstrating, He was patient with them.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.480]   Instead of squashing them in the beginning, He said He was patient with them, demonstrating
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:52.800]   His power and authority over every idol that Egypt was worshiping to demonstrate to the
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.280]   nation of Israel, His people, of who God is.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.200]   That there's only one true God.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.920]   He was preparing them to begin a nation.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.120]   He was preparing them to walk out into the desert so that they could have confidence
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.700]   in their God.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.640]   So in this immediate context when He says, "What if?
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:17.480]   What if God was patient in His wrath, in His judgment, in demonstration of His power for
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.160]   those who are prepared for destruction?"
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.960]   For what purpose?
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.640]   To reveal His glory to those who are prepared for mercy.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.920]   To glorify Himself among His people.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:37.480]   And again, our man-centered way of looking at everything, everything is seen, how does
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   it affect me?
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.960]   How does that personally benefit me?
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.240]   When the beginning of maturity and beginning of salvation is recognizing that we are not
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.600]   at the center of the universe.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.800]   We are not at the center.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.000]   God's ultimate purpose of human history is for His glorification.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.080]   Now again, even for Christians, that may not sit well.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:08.220]   But let me explain why this is so important and why that's the best thing for sinners.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.360]   You have a child who grows up and one of the worst things that you can do is to give him
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.540]   everything he wants.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.400]   He grows up thinking that he's the center of the universe.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.920]   And you think that that's best for him because you're helping and you're giving them.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.800]   They're always happy because you're giving them everything they want.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.000]   Eventually what does it lead to?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   What fruit comes from that?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.360]   Spoiled brat.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.760]   Not only is he spoiled, he's going to be very difficult to like.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.620]   Everybody outside of you is going to have a very difficult time.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:44.880]   So you basically set him up so that everywhere he goes people are going to hate this kid.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.160]   Because he thinks he's the center of the universe.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.800]   When Jesus was going to the cross, He didn't say, "It's time for me to go to the cross
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.200]   so I can save these people."
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   He didn't say that.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.800]   Even though that's what resulted from it.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.320]   When He was going to the cross, He didn't come and say, "You know what?
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.840]   I'm going to wash away their sins."
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.280]   All of these things happen.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.680]   But you know what Jesus said?
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:12.840]   "Father, it's time to glorify your Son and for the Son to glorify you."
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.000]   What does it mean to glorify?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.960]   Glorify means taking something that is valuable and putting it in display so everybody can
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   see it.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.080]   So you guys know that our entrance on this side and our entrance in the front, they decorated
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   nicely.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.560]   We had a lot of brothers and sisters who sacrificed and came and they took literally all day putting
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   that in.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.920]   Why did we put it at the entrance?
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:43.120]   All that nice reclaimed wood and design and all that, their skills and everything that
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.960]   they had, they took literally, I think probably 14, 15 hours they were there.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   Why didn't you do it at the entrance?
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.140]   Why don't we do it back over here or in the storage?
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.140]   Because it's at display.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.140]   We want everybody to see it.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.320]   This is where there's going to be the greatest traffic.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.120]   It's for people to display and see it.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:08.600]   If you haven't walked upstairs to the entrance, the second floor entrance, our brother Phillip
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   displayed his talent.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.920]   He put up a, what do you call that?
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   Ward mural?
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   Is that what you call it?
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.920]   All right.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   I learned something.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.040]   The ward mural, right?
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.400]   And if you've seen it, every single person that walked into the front entrance is wowed
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.400]   by it.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.240]   "Wow, our church is so hipster."
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   Right?
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.720]   That's what I've been hearing.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.200]   I'm not exactly sure what a hipster is, but it sounds good.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.840]   But he put it at the entrance because it's purpose of displaying something for everybody
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   to see.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.240]   That's what glorifying something is.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:52.000]   So when Jesus says, "It's time for you to glorify the Son," what is he putting on display?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.240]   His holiness and his mercy.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.720]   Because at the cross, you know, we typically think about his mercy and sacrifice, but that
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.280]   cross wouldn't make any sense without God's wrath because his wrath was being poured out
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.280]   on his Son.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   Why?
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.640]   Because he's demonstrating his mercy.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:17.040]   So the greatest and the most perfect display of God's holiness and his compassion and mercy
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.200]   is at the cross.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:28.000]   In no other place in human history, past or the future, where we see the most glorification,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.160]   most perfect glorification of the identity and the nature of God is greater than at the
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.320]   cross.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:42.080]   So that's why Jesus says, "It's time to glorify your Son, and now it's time for the Son to
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   glorify you."
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:49.040]   See, it is in his glory that we live.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.760]   When he is magnified, we live.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.340]   When we magnify ourselves, we are destroyed.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:00.760]   Because God did not make us images to be worshipped.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:06.520]   God made us to be bearer of his image, that we may worship him.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.000]   So when we recognize who he is, when he is magnified and glorified, it is no longer about
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.520]   us, and we no longer evaluate everything based upon how it personally affects me.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:22.000]   See, a sanctified mind, a sanctified life evaluates everything based upon does he get
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.360]   the glory, even suffering.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.240]   How is God glorified in my suffering?
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.080]   How is God glorified in my hardship?
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.680]   How is God glorified?
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:38.580]   Because God's ultimate end is for his glory.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:44.160]   Because it is when he is glorified, we live.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.600]   Mankind is saved.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.760]   Jonathan Edwards, in his own words, and it is a short part of a larger writing that he
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:42:01.120]   has on this subject, but let me read why he believes evil is necessary.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.640]   So evil is necessary in order to the highest happiness of creature and the completeness
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.300]   of that communication of God for which he made the world.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.360]   Because the creature's happiness consists in the knowledge of God and the sense of his
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.360]   love.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.320]   So that the knowledge of him be imperfect, the happiness of creature must be proportionately
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.560]   imperfect.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.440]   That the perfect knowledge of God, not a portion, not a part, not certain things that make sense
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.680]   to us, but when the perfect manifestation of his knowledge, when he is glorified, he
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:39.120]   says the greatest happiness for the creatures, it will also increase.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.440]   Let me again, as I wrap up this morning's message.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:50.200]   You know, obviously I preach every Sunday, you know, and I, you know, preparing sermons
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:55.080]   and every text in the scripture is valuable, obviously.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.620]   But every once in a while I come across a text that I'm meditating on and it just takes
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.000]   my breath away.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.220]   And to think that this is the text, right?
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:12.780]   This is the text where God says, "Who are you, O man, to talk back to God?
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.900]   You're just clay and he's the potter."
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:27.080]   What if, what if in God displaying his wrath and his power dealt patiently in order that
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.060]   he may be manifested, his glory may be manifested to those who have been prepared for mercy.
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:38.020]   And to think that that's the passage.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.920]   But I was meditating on this and thinking about it and I can't properly articulate
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.020]   to you why it had that impact on me.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.980]   I was just sitting there meditating on this.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.340]   Wow.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.740]   I don't get it.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.900]   There's a lot of stuff that I can't explain to you and even this, like I can't perfectly
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.740]   explain to you how this works.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:07.240]   All I can tell you is that's what he says and why it makes perfect sense to me.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:16.780]   And not only does it make perfect sense to me, I feel alive in the presence of his glory.
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:22.700]   When God manifests himself as he is, I can't articulate it.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.060]   I can't explain to you how or what I've seen.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.700]   I can't draw you a picture.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.860]   I can't tell you why.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:38.460]   But in the presence of his perfect knowledge as he is, it's breathless.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.820]   There's nothing like it.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:51.220]   The moment we try to compromise and make impalatable to our taste, you diminish his glory.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.820]   You diminish his glory.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:59.180]   In his full glory, he is vengeful, wrathful, merciful, faithful.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.260]   He's all of that together.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.880]   And when he is manifested as he is, when we see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.580]   that's where we live.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.860]   That's why the devil is trying so hard to blind the mind of the unbeliever so they do
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.740]   not see the gospel of the glory.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.920]   All of these things is to manifest himself.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.660]   And I pray that each one of us would approach the scriptures with humility, that this is
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.140]   the God of the universe that we're approaching.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.460]   And the big question that we ought to live with every single day is, why does he care
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.860]   about me?
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   Let's pray.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:53.700]   You want to take some time to pray.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:00.200]   Whatever it is that you're struggling with, whatever trials or frustration or annoyance
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:07.560]   or personal conflicts that you may have, I can't explain to you how Jesus is going to
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.000]   fix that.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.120]   I can't explain to you what he's going to say, what passage, what counseling that can
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.520]   give that's going to make sense of that.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:22.000]   All I know that Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.600]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.320]   The only way that we can have access to the author of life is to come through Christ.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.560]   So come to him.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.480]   Come to him this morning.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.160]   Pray to him.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.120]   Honest confession.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.600]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
