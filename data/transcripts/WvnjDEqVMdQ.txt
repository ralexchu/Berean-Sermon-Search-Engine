[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.460]   Hi, good morning. Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.460]   For those of you who are visiting us,
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.460]   we have a welcome table. As you were coming in from the street,
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.460]   you probably ran into our welcome table. Maybe you've seen it, didn't see it.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.460]   But we encourage you to visit that table, and if you have any questions about the church,
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.460]   our welcome team will be able to kind of direct you toward the right people and answer some of the questions for you.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.460]   And especially along with that, our college ministry,
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   those of you who are collegians who are visiting us for the first time,
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.460]   for the next maybe about a month or two, we're going to be having a separate college welcome table set up.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.460]   And so right along where the welcome table is, Pastor Nate and some of the college staff
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.460]   and members, core members of the church in the college department is going to be in that area.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.460]   So if you go visit there, they have separate activities.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.460]   They have events that are going on throughout the week, and so they'll be able to give you more information about that.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.460]   If you visit that table after service.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:03.460]   Seeds nursery. So starting from today, if you have a child between the age of one and four,
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.460]   in our seeds ministry, we've only had the seeds ministry in the second service,
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.460]   but starting from today, the first service is also open to seeds ministry.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.460]   If you have a child from one through four and you want them to, you want to come to the first service,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.460]   so that is open for you. And the only thing that they've asked me to request is if you are a regular member here,
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.460]   if you're visiting here only once or twice, obviously it's not going to be relevant to you,
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:33.460]   but if you're coming every week and you choose to go to that, that they're asking you to commit to it.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.460]   Not to say that if you for some reason have to go that week and you're not welcome to come to that,
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:44.460]   but if you are going to come regularly, and the reason why they're asking that is so that they may have enough people.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:50.460]   They can staff with enough people to watch and run the program over there for first service.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.460]   So if you are planning to do that, it is starting today and obviously you've already missed it.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.460]   So if you are planning to do that starting from next week, it will be available for the first service.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:06.460]   All church praise and prayer, that's scheduled for September 17th, just to mark on your calendar.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:17.460]   And also, along with that, we have an ACBC mini conference that's coming up in October.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.460]   So October 15th, 16th, it's a little bit away from now, but we want you to put that on your calendar
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.460]   in case you're making events around our Bible study schedule. So that's a Friday and Saturday.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:34.460]   So basically, this is going to be open to all collegians, to singles, to married, to the whole church.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:41.460]   And so as we came back from our summer retreat, encouraging and being blessed by the biblical counseling messages
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.460]   that we received, we want to continue to encourage our church to be equipped.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.460]   And maybe some of you would be interested in getting biblical counseling certificates
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.460]   and continue to pursue how to encourage other people, to disciple other people with God's word.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:02.460]   And so that session that we're doing is really to kind of equip the church and to encourage our church to go down that path.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:08.460]   And so registration for that is going to start soon. And so just keep an eye out.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.460]   But we just want you to just save the date for that week. So it's 15th and 16th of October.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.460]   OK, so that week we won't be having normal Bible study because of that. All right.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:24.460]   Membership class, our membership class, the next session is starting on September 26th.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:30.460]   We are going to start having it in the youth room. So the new youth room is open.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.460]   That next door, they were meeting in the corner in the cafe, but they're moved into starting from today.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   They moved into the new youth area, which is at the very end of the building.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:45.460]   So if you have children who are youth or you need to tell your kids to find their way there,
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.460]   so they're no longer meeting in the same place in the corner. It's actually at the exact opposite at the other corner.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   So they have to walk. There's no entrance on this side right now.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.460]   So you'd have to go to the other side of the parking lot, go to the end of the building.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:03.460]   And you when you run into the trash can, you're there. OK, so basically you're going to hit the trash and then you turn left.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.460]   And that's the entrance to the youth room. OK, so they're going to have some kind of sign there.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.460]   But if you have children that age or if you know and somebody asks you where the youth room is,
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.460]   just tell them to go to the other side to the building and the entrance will be there.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.460]   That's starting today. And that's where the new membership class is going to start.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:25.460]   Start taking place on 26th. When if you're signed up for the membership class,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:31.460]   that's where it's going to be starting at nine o'clock. OK, and then along with that, starting today,
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.460]   the equipping classes are going to continue. So Elder James is teaching the theology class,
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.460]   and that's going to be taking place up in this Sprouts room.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:50.460]   OK, upstairs. And so our former cafe. So that's where you want to go if you want to take that class at 2 p.m.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.460]   So grab your lunch, finish it and then come to that class at 2 p.m.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.460]   And then Pastor Mark about spiritual maturity. That class is taking place in this room at 2 p.m.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:07.460]   OK, so one's here and then one's upstairs. OK, and then finally, we have one last push for BBA.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.460]   So if you are a Borean Basketball Association, so if you if you're planning to play and you haven't signed up,
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.460]   there is a sign up table outside at the entrance to the cafe to the right of it.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.460]   We're going to have some people manning that table. So go and please sign up for that.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:29.460]   I was told that the WBBA is they are planning to have it. And actually, Hamamoto, she's here somewhere in the room.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.460]   She's the point person. So you might want to tell her that you are also interested in playing.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.460]   And I think they're going to be playing while the guys are playing.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:44.460]   And then I've been hearing rumors that there's going to be a SBBA, senior BBA.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:52.460]   And if you are interested and if if you happen to be old, they're not old, right?
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:58.460]   Older don't show up. We don't want 30 year old showing up and saying like, oh, my back hurts.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:06.460]   You want to be the Michael Jordan of the senior league? No. OK, so I hear it's going to be maybe half court.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:12.460]   There's going to be a lot of a lot of stretching, some playing.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.460]   So if you are interested in playing in that in that league, I'm not sure if it's confirmed.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.460]   So I think Elder Phillip is going to be the the head person for that.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.460]   If you're interested, let him know. OK. All right. So let me take a minute to pray for our offering.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.460]   And again, if you have a physical offering, there's a basket in the back that you can give it to.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:38.460]   Otherwise, we'll give you a few minutes to give it electronically. Let's pray.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.460]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for all the blessings that you've given us in our life.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:52.460]   Help us not to take for granted what you have given, that we would truly be able to worship you in spirit and in truth in every way.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.460]   Whatever distractions that we brought into this room, help us, Lord God, through the praise,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.460]   through the worship, that our hearts may be given to you fully.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.460]   Lord, give us soft hearts, open ears, Lord God, that we may be attentive to what you have to say to us.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:14.460]   May your name be praised this morning and even the giving that we give may be multiplied for your use.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.460]   In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   >> Amen, you may be seated.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   [ Applause ]
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   >> If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, verse 25 through 29.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 25 through 29.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   Reading out of the NASB, see to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   For those who did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   And his voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised saying, yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   This expression, yet once more, denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken as of created things so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   For our God is a consuming fire.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   Let's pray.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   We pray that power of your word would convict and guide us.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   Renew us, strengthen us, Lord God, that we may live worthy lives of the gospel that you've given.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   So we pray for your direction, your Holy Spirit to lead.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Amen.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   Okay, we're going to continue on from what we started last week where we talked about what a proper response to the gospel of Jesus Christ is.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   When we say because of God's grace, if we have a wrong understanding of the gospel and the grace, we can easily think because of grace, it doesn't matter what I do.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   That we have Christian liberty in Christ, so however I live, even though I ought to live this way, but there isn't any consequence anymore because God has covered us with his blood.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   If we have a superficial understanding and possibly an understanding of cheap grace, we may easily apply it that way.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   But as grace is grace, the Bible tells us that there is consequence if we refuse this grace.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   And that's what he says in verse 25, chapter 12, we just read.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   It says, "See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   For if those who did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven."
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   If God said everything that he said to the old covenant people and they didn't respond in a way that they ought to have and there were serious consequences,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   how much more, when it's not just a glimpse of him, it was not just a theophany, but God himself speaking from heaven,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   that we just say, "Oh, okay, that's what he says, that's what he believes."
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   And we just continue to go on living our life any way that we want.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   That's exactly what he was trying to address in the book of Hebrews.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   And that's why I think the book of Hebrews is so relevant to us today.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   Because he's not wrestling with any particular doctrine.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   There wasn't anything that he was saying that this is the problem, that you guys are guilty of idolatry.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   You guys are guilty of this and that.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   He said the main problem with the audience of the Hebrews was they were just drifting.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   They weren't passionately pursuing Christ anymore.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   He wasn't supreme anymore.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   They've lost their first love.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   And he said, "How can we escape if we simply neglect such a great salvation?"
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   That's why I think this is so relevant to us in our generation where you and I practice our Christianity,
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   because this is our primary challenge.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Hearing the gospel, and we become so inoculated by the truth,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   where it's just kind of, you know, I just signed off on it, and then the rest of my life I just kind of live like everybody else.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   He said, "See to it that you do not refuse him."
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   What does it mean to refuse him?
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   You don't have to shake your hand and say, "You know what? I don't believe in God.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   I'm an atheist, and I'm going to worship idols."
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   You don't need to do that.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   In fact, that's not what he's addressing in the book of Hebrews.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   To refuse him, first and foremost, is simply to remain willfully ignorant of the truth.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   Willfully ignorant.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Not ignorant because you haven't been taught.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Not ignorant because you haven't had access.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   But simply ignorant because you just weren't interested.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   Most people in our generation has no idea what the Bible says.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   They can tell what the latest album is dropping, and what the latest trend is,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   and what athlete has what percentage, and what batting average,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   and they know all of this stuff, but they say, "Turn to the book of Hebrews.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   Turn to a certain passage in the Bible."
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   And after 10, 15, 20, 30 years of being a Christian, they still don't know.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   And it's not because they haven't been taught.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   It just wasn't important enough for them to pursue.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   So we can refuse him by willfully being ignorant of God's Word.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   We can be willfully ignorant by studying the Word of God and not applying it.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   Like it says in the book of James, you're constantly hearing but not doing.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   Faith without deeds is dead faith.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   This is straight from the Bible.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   It means nothing if you just profess, and all that is is a profession,
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   and there's no deeds that follow.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   So we can refuse him by studying and not applying what the Bible has to say.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   Thirdly, you can refuse him by studying what the Bible says
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   and picking and choosing what you want to apply
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   and then certain things that you don't want to apply.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   So partial obedience, obedience only to the things that I want to obey
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   and the things that I don't want to obey, I just kind of keep at bay and say,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   "You know what? God understands. We're saved by grace anyway."
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   We can refuse him in that way, and in every way, every one of the things that I've mentioned,
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   the Bible mentions that that is a form of refusing God.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   In 2 Timothy 3, 5, and 7, it says that in the end times,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   and Paul is warning Timothy as a young pastor preparing him to go to the area of Ephesus
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   to fight wrong doctrines because all these fellow co-workers are starting to drop out and backslide.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   And he's telling them, he's telling Timothy, "I want you to prepare for this.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   This is what you're going to run into as a pastor."
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   He says, "At the end times, you're going to run into people who are holding to a form of godliness
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   although they have denied its power.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   Avoid such men as these, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   A form of godliness, in other words, they do what you're supposed to do externally.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   They have a reputation of being godly because they know how to play this game.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   They've been in the church for a very long time.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   You know what to say. If they ask you how you're doing spiritually,
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   "I'm doing okay," or "I'm struggling," and you know what you can say.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   You know how to get along. So you have a form of godliness,
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   but you have no knowledge of its power.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   That's the distinction between somebody who's excited about his faith
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   and passionately pursuing Christ because you've recognized his power,
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   you've experienced his power, versus somebody who's always hearing the sermon
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   but never able to come to the true knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   You notice here in verse 7, he says, "Always learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of truth."
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   You notice here, he says, "He's always learning, but never knowing."
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   Always learning, but never knowing.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   You see the distinction that he's making?
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   That you can study, especially if you're at a Bible-teaching church,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   we're doing Bible study, and you're going through the verses,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   and you're always learning. You're adding knowledge upon knowledge upon knowledge,
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   but you're never coming and encountering Christ
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   because we're refusing him in some way in our life.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   We've created this pseudo-Christian life that is completely contrary to what the Bible teaches,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   and so you've accumulated so much knowledge about the Bible,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   but you don't know Christ.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   You know the distinction between somebody who's learning a lot
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   versus somebody who encounters and knows God?
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   Somebody who has a lot of knowledge, the benefit of having a lot of knowledge,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   that you know that I have that knowledge.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   So the more that I read, the more that I encounter,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   the more that I want you to know how much I know,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   because that's the benefit of the study.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   But the difference between somebody who's constantly studying
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   and not encountering and knowing God
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   is an individual whose knowledge is always learning to know Christ.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   And that's the distinction between somebody who's always learning,
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   but not knowing Christ, versus somebody who's learning and encountering Christ.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Because a person who is learning to encounter Christ,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   you'll see in their language they're going to be talking about who Jesus is.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   But an individual who accumulates a lot of knowledge
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   are going to make sure that you know how much knowledge they have,
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   what books that they've read, people that they know.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   That's who he says.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   That in the church, in our generation, our biggest challenge now is that,
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   where we have a form of godliness.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   You have no knowledge of his power.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   See, God's grace reminds us and challenges us and warns us
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   to live according to what's going to last.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   And that's what he was saying in verse 26 and 27.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   His voice shook the earth then, but now he is promising,
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   He's reminding them about when he showed himself at Mount Sinai,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   where people were terrified, and his very presence scared them.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   And as he came and he shook the earth, he says,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   but now God is speaking from heaven.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   It's not just a portion of his glory. It wasn't a theophany.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   God himself from heaven is speaking to us directly.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   And he says, yet once more denotes the removing of those things
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   which cannot be shaken as of creative things,
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   You know, this building, some of you guys may remember
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   when we were trying to get into this building about four plus years ago.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   You know, we had all these things that we had to do,
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   but most of the things that we did to this building to move in here
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   are things that you wouldn't notice, right?
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   Because we deliberately bought this building
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   because we didn't want to do a lot of construction.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   So we spent almost, I think about $700,000 to $800,000 fixing this place up.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   The majority of that went to things that you can't see.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   It was because this used to be a plumbing warehouse,
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   and so there weren't a lot of people in this room.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   So in order for us to convert this to a church,
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   because of the number of people coming in and out,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   the city had a different requirement for the seismic standard,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   meaning that it has to withhold, you know,
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   the building has to be much stronger than a plumbing building
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   because if an earthquake hits, it needs to make sure that it doesn't fall.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   So the majority of the money went to making holes.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   You know these beams? Each one of these beams had to be fortified.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   So we had guys go up there with a drill, maybe about a foot long,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   and make drills, and then we had to have...
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   Yeah, we had to anchor it. Yeah.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   I forgot. I wasn't looking for anchor. I was looking for the screws.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   Okay, yeah, bolts. Yeah.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   We had to have like almost a foot long bolts to anchor each one of...
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   Every one of these beams have about eight anchors in each one of them.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   And it's not just here. This is all throughout the building, upstairs,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   even in the cafe area.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   So all of that had to be torn down, all the air conditioning,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   the insulation, all of that had to be torn down,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   and then just put back up.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   That was majority of the construction in this area.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   And so when the inspectors came,
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   they actually had our construction guys go up there
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   and take out some of the stuff to make sure that we did it correctly.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   Because all the aesthetic stuff about the stage, about the painting,
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   they didn't care about that stuff.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   The main thing that they cared about was if an earthquake hit,
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   that because now this is going to be used as a church,
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.800]   we need to make sure that this building is going to be sound.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   So if there's an earthquake, this is the best place to be.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   Right? They tell you normally run outside.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   I would run back in. Right?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   All of that because they want to make sure,
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   especially in California, that if the big one hits,
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   and it happens to be in the middle of our service,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   that this building isn't going to easily collapse.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   See, when the Bible says, when the passage in Hebrews says,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   that when he comes, he's going to be shaking things,
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   and he repeats this over and over again in these two verses,
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   is to remind us that everything that we hold,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   that's not going to stand the test of the shaking,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   is not going to make it.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   So this morning what I want to go over is this shaking.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   What did it mean, and what was it teaching, and what is he referring to?
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   So first of all, when there's a violent shake,
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   when God shows up and there's a violent shake,
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   it was to remind them of the awesomeness of who God is.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   To take his word seriously.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   Exodus 19, verse 18, "Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   because the Lord descended upon it in fire,
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   and the whole mountain quaked violently."
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   And then again in Judges 5, 4-5, referring to the giving of the law,
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   it says, "The Lord, when you went out from Seir,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   when you marched from the field of Edom, the earthquake,
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   the heavens also dropped, dripped, even the clouds dripped water,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   the mountains quaked at the presence of the Lord,
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   this Sinai at the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel."
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   You know, I think most Californians have become desensitized to earthquakes,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   but if you've ever had a family member or friend
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   who doesn't live in California, and they come to visit or live here for a short period,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   and then a minor earthquake hits, maybe like a 3.0,
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   you know, a 3.0 earthquake for most Californians is nothing, right?
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   But the idea of the earth shifting, I mean, think about that.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   If you've never experienced that before, the earth,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   we're not talking about strong winds, we're not talking about fire,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   we're talking about the earth on which your house is built on moves.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   I mean, he's reminding them, remember when God showed up,
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   and there was a violent quaking, and that God's presence,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   even the mountains were shaking in His presence.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   What do you think that did to the people?
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   Automatically, when there was a shaking, they realized something serious,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   something powerful was coming, that God's presence alone
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   would shake the very foundations of the earth.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   That's what he is referring to, and yet he says in verse 26,
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   "Yet," do you remember when God spoke from earth,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   "Yet, once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   Everything created is going to be tested when it is in the presence of a holy God.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   That's what it's referring to.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   You know, those of you who've lived in California for a long period of time,
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   you guys remember the Northridge earthquake.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   Some of you guys may not have been born by then,
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   some of you are a little bit older.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   In 1994, at 4.30 a.m. in Northridge, there was a 6.7 magnitude.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   They said there was over $77 billion of damage that was done.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   So some of you guys who are a little bit older may remember.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   During that time, basically California was shut down for a long period,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   especially in Northridge.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   I knew somebody who just closed on a house,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   literally two, three months before the earthquake hit,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   and there wasn't a single house that wasn't affected by this earthquake.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   It was that big.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   Either cracked walls or fences were torn down.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   Freeways collapsed over there.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   Remember the 405?
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   Freeways completely collapsed, and you couldn't get around.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   That's how bad big 6.9 was.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   But as bad as that was, the biggest earthquake that I personally experienced
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   was the one in Whittier in 1987.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   And the reason why that was more devastating to me
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   was because I was in La Mirada that day.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   And La Mirada is the neighboring city to that.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   And I was getting ready to go to my Old Testament survey class at 7.45,
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   and the class was at 8 o'clock,
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   and I just started seeing this shift like that, just like an earthquake.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   But this one kept on going.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   It got stronger and stronger.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   And I literally saw the parking lot move like that.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   You know how you have earthquakes that shake,
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   and then you have an earthquake that rolls?
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   That one was kind of that--rolled like that.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   And it was rolling, and I thought, "Okay, Jesus is here."
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   [laughter]
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   It's like--I've experienced an earthquake, but nothing like that.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   And then I saw--if you know Biola, most of the buildings in Biola,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   at least the older buildings, are made out of brick.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   And I saw brick buildings curving like that on the parking lot.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   And I'm standing here, and I saw cars at the end of the parking lot
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   come up and down like this.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   This is it.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   Earth is opening up, you know, and I'm ready to meet the Lord.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   I had friends who were already in the class jumping out of the window.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   It was on the first floor, so it wasn't that dangerous.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   [laughter]
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   But everybody was going crazy, and I remember like, "Wow,
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   I've never experienced anything like that.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   How can cement and brick move that way?"
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   As crazy as that was, on the news they said,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   "You know, this may be a precursor to something bigger coming."
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   Because ever since I've been in California, the experts, seismologists,
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   have been saying the big one is coming, and that wasn't the big one.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   Even the 6.7 in Whittier, I mean in Northridge, as big as that was,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   is that all of these things are going to trigger.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   So every time there's an earthquake in California,
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   there's a fear that it's going to trigger the big one.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   And if you may have heard about the big one, and if you haven't heard of it,
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   I'm going to tell you now so that you don't need to be informed.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   They said that this is going to be so big, there's a possibility
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   that California may crack away from the rest of the country.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Yeah, that's what they said.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   That's how big the San Andreas Fault is going to be,
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   that we can be a gigantic Hawaii.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   They say that this may happen.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   So what happened was, after the '87 earthquake happened,
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   after the '94 earthquake happened, there was a mass exodus from California.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   I know there's a mass exodus right now because of political reasons,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   but it was nothing like back then.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   Back then, people were packing up their bags and moving to Colorado, wherever,
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   outside of California.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   Rightfully so, because they were saying that California was going to crack.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   So how can you possibly invest in anything here if the earth is going to crack?
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   How can you possibly purchase a house if the house can be broken
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   when the earthquake hits?
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   What can you possibly--what are you going to build here
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   if the earthquake is going to come?
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   So out of fear, in order to live, people packed up everything and left.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   Obviously, it's been many years since that has happened,
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   but every time there's an earthquake, that announcement gets recirculated.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   It didn't happen. It's going to happen.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   So those of us who lived through that, we've become desensitized.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   It's like, "Ah, it's going to happen. I heard this before."
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   It's been many years. 20, 30 years have already passed.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   "It'll happen. I'm sure it'll happen, but maybe not during my lifetime."
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   Those of you who've never heard this before,
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   you're almost like, "Oh my gosh, is this real?"
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   Well, look it up. I'm not making this up. This is real.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   Why am I saying all of this stuff?
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   Because the author of Hebrews is reminding us that no matter how great
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   of an earthquake you may have experienced in the past,
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   when Jesus comes in His full glory,
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   whatever human history has experienced is going to pale in comparison.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   For some reason, we have presented the gospel in such a way
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   that Jesus is still this meek, humble servant who's on his knees
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   looking for people's feet to wash.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   And all of these things are true. It's in the Bible.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   But have you read Revelation?
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   Because Revelation is just as important as the Gospel of John.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   Have you read Revelation? When He comes in His glory,
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   He's not coming as a humble servant.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   He's coming as the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   Go back and read chapter 1. Go back and read the rest of Revelation.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   Jesus is coming in His full glory.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   And when He comes, the Bible says, "The earth will shake."
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   And this shaking is going to be much greater than what happened in Mount Sinai.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   In Revelation 6.12 it says, "I looked when He broke the sixth seal,
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black,
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   and sackcloth made of air, and the whole moon became like blood."
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   Revelation 11.13, "And in that hour there was a great earthquake,
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   and a tenth of the city fell, 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake."
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   7,000 people were killed, and rest were terrified,
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   and gave glory to God of heaven.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   Isn't that strange?
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   People are dying. They're terrified.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   And yet it says God was receiving the glory.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Because they knew. They knew.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   In the presence of God's glory, all this was happening because of His presence,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   not because of lack of His presence.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   In Revelation 16.17-20, "And the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air."
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   This is the last judgment that is explained.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   "And a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, 'It is done.'"
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   The judgment is done, "and there were flashes, and lightning, and sounds, and peals of thunder,
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   So great an earthquake was it, and so mighty."
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   So there is trembling throughout the judgment,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   and then it ends with the greatest trembling that mankind has ever seen.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   He says all of this to reveal that God in His full glory will come.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   Are we ready for this?
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   We know that the earth, when it shakes, it deserves all of us.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   And some people are willing to pack up and go somewhere else.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   Rightfully so.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   But yet, do we believe that when He comes,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   that anything that you and I have experienced is going to pale in comparison?
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   So when there is a quaking in the Bible,
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   it is to remind us of the awesomeness of God's presence that's coming.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   But secondly, when a quaking happens, the Bible says that it is to test and to purify
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   and make sure that all the non-essentials are shaken off.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   In Hebrews 12, verse 27, this expression yet once more denotes the removing of those things
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   which can be shaken as the created thing,
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:15.800]   so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   God allows some shaking in our lives at times
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   to cause us to take a second look and see how valuable these things are.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   Are these things going to make it?
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   That's why we have all these things that are placed in,
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   so that when the earthquake comes, that we can make it through the earthquake.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   But this building hasn't been tested.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   Even though it's all there, all the preparation has been made.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   The city would not allow us to come into this building unless the preparation has been made,
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   but it hasn't been tested.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   The Bible says that God allows smaller tremors in our lives to test the quality of our faith.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   In 1 Peter 1, 6-7, "In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while,
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   if necessary you have been distressed by various trials,
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   so that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   which is perishable, even though tested by fire,
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   may be found to result in praise and glory, honor and revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   When the great Judgment Day comes,
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   the only thing that's going to matter, the only thing that's going to save us,
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   the only thing that's going to have value is the quality of our faith,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   which is going to cover us from the wrath that is to come.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   So He allows us to experience the tremors to test the quality of our faith.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   That's what He says.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   Like I said, this building has been prepared for a greater seismic, you know, if it does come,
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   but it hasn't been tested.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   But you know what has been tested?
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   My house.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   My house has been tested, and it's tested all the time.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   The reason why it's tested is because we live next to a train track.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   We've been living next to a train track for over 10 to 12 years.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   And so when you first live next to a train track, like it's kind of disturbing,
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   and I don't think that's a place that a lot of people would like to live
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   because your house is always shaking, right?
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   I've gotten so used to it, like I don't even notice.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   In fact, unless the earthquake is anything below 4.5, I don't even wake up because,
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   "Oh, it's a train," right?
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   But that house that we live in is constantly shaking.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.800]   So you know when the Metro goes by?
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.800]   I know it's the Metro with people on it because it moves fast, and it's pretty light,
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   and it comes and it shakes for a little while like this, and then it's gone.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   But I know when those freight trains come, you know, it's long, slow-moving, heavy,
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   and really it rumbles.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   It literally just rumbles like this.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   And whatever conversation we have, we have to stop for a second,
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   unless we have the window closed.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   So there is no settling in our house.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   You know, most houses, especially the newer ones, you buy it,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   and then in the middle of the night you'll hear creaking.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   It's not the ghost.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   It's your house, just kind of the weight of the house just kind of settling
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   and the slight movements of the wood.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   So if you're a new house owner, that's what happens to a house.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   It takes years, and the house just kind of settles, right?
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.800]   Our house has been settled.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   I don't hear any creaking.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   I've lived in other houses, but I usually don't hear any creaks in our house
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   because whatever creaking settling is going to happen, it's happened, right?
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   Because every day it's being tested, right?
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   Now, we haven't been tested by the magnitude of that size,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   but the small tremors does nothing to our house, right?
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   And it's deliberately built that way.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   And homes in California are better built for that reason
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   because we're used to tremors, right?
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.800]   And, again, I don't want to go sidetracked,
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   but there's a reason why Californians don't have basements.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   It's because of the earthquakes, right?
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   All of this to say the Bible is telling us that in the end, when Christ comes,
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   all things are going to be tested.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:07.800]   And the only thing that survives from this test is going to be in eternity with him.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.800]   And so what is the purpose of all of that?
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   To invest in things that's going to stand the test of time when Christ comes.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   God allows certain things that happen in our life to test.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   But you know what I found out through the years,
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   that the greatest test all throughout history hasn't been the hardships,
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   the persecutions, and the difficulties.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:35.800]   You know, when this pandemic hit, even non-Christians were praying.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   I heard rap stars, you know, like most vulgar lyrics saying, "We need to pray.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   We need to pray."
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   Even non-Christians who have no faith in God, when hardship comes,
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   know that they need something outside of them.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   The greatest testing of our faith, I found, that most people, a lot of people,
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:05.800]   don't make is when we are not pressed, when our bills are paid,
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   and things are good, and family is good.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   And we see that same pattern in the Old Testament.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   When the Israelites had the greatest problem was when bills were paid,
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   when they didn't have enemies, when life was secure.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.800]   And what happened?
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.800]   They got proud.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   They forgot God.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:31.800]   And as soon as they forgot God, they started slipping into idolatry.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   Every day we are being tested.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:38.800]   You know, one of the benefits of this pandemic is it's forced us to look at things
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   that are essential, right?
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   And who knew toilet paper was so essential, right?
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   But it's like toilet paper somehow is essential.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   You know, you think water is essential.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.800]   Food is essential.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   And then as a church, we have to take a step back and ask ourselves,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   how essential is our church?
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   How essential is our gathering?
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   So we're wrestling through all of this when the non-Christian world says the church
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   is not essential.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   It's understandable.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   We shouldn't get mad at them saying that because they don't believe God.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:17.800]   So to them, liquor stores are essential because liquor can calm you down.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   So when they have hardship and they're freaking out, you know,
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   go to the liquor store and get some liquor and then put it in their body.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   It calms them down.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   But church, this is just a placebo.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   It's not essential.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   So it's understandable.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   People who don't know Christ will label the church non-essential because
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   it's not doing anything other than giving you a security blanket to make you feel better.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   At least liquor, there's something tangible that you're doing.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   But the shocking thing was so many churches just embrace that.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   What is essential in our life that we need to hold on to and fight for and to pursue
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:04.800]   that when Christ comes that we will not think that we wasted our lives?
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   We are being tested constantly to see what is essential?
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   What is really essential?
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   What is going to test the shaking when Christ comes?
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   I remember years ago, you know, he was pretty young then.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   He was a 20-year-old, and it was during a period when there was the ear piercing.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.800]   I'm not just talking about any ear piercing, but you pierce and then you make it
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   the size of a pencil, and then the next stage is to make it a nickel size,
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.800]   and then the next stage was a quarter size.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   So you might not remember.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.800]   I think it's been maybe about 16, 17 years ago.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   And so, you know, this guy, he was in a band, and he already had a hole in there
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   that was the size of a pencil, and he asked me, "What do you think about making it
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   larger to a quarter?"
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.800]   And I said, "You know, I don't have any particular problem.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   There's no Bible verse I'm going to quote you and say you can't do that,
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   but let me just give you some worldly wisdom as an older brother.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   It's cool right now, and you're part of a band, so maybe that kind of fits your MO,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   but you're not going to be in that for long, and one day it may not be cool, right,
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   because there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   Everything that was cool when we were younger is very dorky today."
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   It's not even not cool, it's just dorky.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.800]   But there's going to come a time when you're going to wake up one day,
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   and then you're going to see a big hole that you can't close up,
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.800]   and you're not going to think it's cool, but it's going to be there permanently.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.800]   So I know you don't understand.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   You may not agree with what I say now, but I told him, "You're 20 years old.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   Ten years ago when you were 10, what do you think?
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   Are there things that you said and did and valued when you were 10 years old?"
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.800]   As a 20-year-old, I was like, "That is so dumb. That is so dorky."
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.800]   He said, "Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff I did when I was 10 years old."
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   Okay, so now you're 10 years more mature.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   Do you think that you have reached the peak of your maturity at the age of 20,
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   that another 10 years from now when you're 30,
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.800]   that you're not going to look back at the things that you did when you were 20,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   and then say, "Well, that was dorky. That was dumb.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   It was so cool then, but at a 30-year-old."
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.800]   And you think that stops at 30?
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.800]   You think you can wake up when you're 40 and look back at things that you did at your 30,
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   and then realize, "Oh, I wish I had this knowledge then."
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   All our life, we're not at our final destiny.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.800]   So things that were so important at that period of our life,
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   it doesn't stand the test of time.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.800]   And so God is speaking to us from eternity.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   The things that seemed so important at that moment
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   is going to seem like nothing in the context of eternity.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   And so as a 20-year-old is wise to listen to a 30-year-old,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   and 30-year-old is wise to listen to a 40-year-old,
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   40-year-old is wise to listen to a 50-year-old, and on and on and on.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.800]   God is speaking from heaven. That's why He said, "Do not refuse Him,"
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   because God knows what's going to stand the test of time.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   And all that we have been entangled with and concerned about,
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   in the end, may not even matter.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   That's what He's saying.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   So pursue the things that matter.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   Pursue the things that you're not going to regret in 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, 100 years,
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   1,000 years later, that you're not going to look back at this,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.800]   that short period of time that you and I are living,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   and miss, that comes and goes,
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   and to forfeit the blessing that God has for us in eternity.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   When He comes in full glory,
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.800]   a radical change of values are going to happen when we are in Christ.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   All that after the violent shaking of His coming,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   only true faith,
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   only the things that last for eternity.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   And that's why He says in John 6.27,
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life,
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him, the Father, God has set His seal."
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   In other words, He's ordained it.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   To pursue the things that God has ordained for eternity, not for the moment.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   I mentioned tattoos in the first service, and I had a pushback.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   People were very uncomfortable.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   I'm going to say it again.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   [laughter]
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   I don't have anything against tattoos.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   Okay?
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   So you say, "Oh, he's a legalist."
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.800]   I don't have anything against tattoos.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   But it applies to tattoos, right?
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   I don't have anything against tattoos, okay?
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   Don't come up to me after service.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   I already told you, okay?
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   Some tattoos have meaning, right?
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   I've seen people with tattoos that have meanings.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   Military guys who have lost their fellow soldiers or people who have lost their children.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   I've seen things with meaning.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   But there's a lot of things that you're going to put on your body that's not going to look too good, right?
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   When you're 40, 60, 80.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   I have nothing against it.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   I'm just telling you from an older brother in Christ.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   Give it a little bit more thought.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800]   [laughter]
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   What's cool today--and I'm only picking on tattoos, but that applies to everything in life, right?
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   What seems cool today for the moment is going to pass.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   And like I said, it is not just tattoos.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   It's the homes that we purchase.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   The clothes that we buy.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   The experiences that we want.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   The accolades of people.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   The next stage of our job in our career.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   The opinions of men and women.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.800]   All of these things, in time, will pass.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   So therefore, he says to invest in things that are eternal.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   And there's four things that the Bible says that will stand the test of time.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.800]   And one is God himself.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.800]   God himself will not change.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   He's the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   So if we're going to be concerned about building anything, if we're going to be pursuing anything,
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   to pursue the kingdom of God.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   And that's why it says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you."
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   First, is he our priority?
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   Number two, the word of God.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   The word of God.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   1 Peter 1 24-25, "For all flesh, like grass, and all its glory, like the flowers of grass,
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.800]   the grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.800]   And this is the word which was preached to you."
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.800]   This is why we emphasize the word so much in our church,
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   because everything else that is trendy for the moment will pass.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:14.800]   But God's word that he has ordained a thousand years ago, two thousand years ago, six thousand years ago,
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   still remains to be proven to be true today.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.800]   And it will last forever.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.800]   The church of God.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.800]   When Jesus says, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   That's why we commit to the building of the church.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   More than anything else.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   Because he said he's going to commit to it.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   He's going to make sure that it's going to stand the shaking of time.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.800]   So therefore, to commit to what he has committed to,
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800]   the building up of the body of Christ.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   And third and finally, your salvation and my salvation is secure in Christ.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   In Romans 8 37-39, "But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through him who loved us.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.800]   nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created things
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.800]   will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   Our identity in Christ is secure.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   If our faith is proven to be genuine.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   And that's why when the disciples came back, and they were rejoicing over the fact
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   that the demons were submitting to them.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   They were excited. Just common fishermen went back, and they were able to cast out demons.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   Like, wow, this is exciting.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.800]   And Jesus says, great, and you're going to see greater things.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   But if you're going to rejoice over everything, rejoice that your name is written in the book of life.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   Everything else will come and go.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.800]   Sometimes you will see fruit, sometimes you will not.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   Sometimes you will experience peace, sometimes you will not.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.800]   But the love of God remains forever.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.800]   So that's what he means.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   He said, when you hear the voice of God, do not refuse him who speaks from heaven.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   There is eternal consequences.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   So my prayer is that no matter what we are going through, no matter what we are distracted by,
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   that there is a need for us to constantly test,
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   are the things that I am pursuing temporary things?
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.800]   Are the things that I am so concerned about temporary things?
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.800]   Are the things that I spend all my money on, are they temporary?
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:34.800]   Am I genuinely pursuing the things that will last the test of his coming?
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   I pray that that may be the case. Let's pray.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.800]   So again, as our worship team comes, if we can take a few minutes to come before the Lord
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   and genuinely examine our life.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   What am I pursuing? What do I value? What do I rejoice over?
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   What do I weep over? Are they things that are eternal?
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   Or are they things that are temporal?
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.800]   Lord, search me and know me. See if there are any hurtful ways in me.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   And ask the Lord to reveal these things so that we may continue to follow Christ,
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   not live in a pattern where we refuse him.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.800]   Again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.

[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.320]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.680]   who according to His great mercy
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.320]   has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.240]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.360]   to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.760]   and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.000]   who are protected by the power of God through faith
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.080]   for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.680]   In this you greatly rejoice,
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.880]   even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.000]   you have been distressed by various trials,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.400]   so that the proof of your faith,
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.280]   being more precious than gold, which is perishable,
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.880]   even though tested by fire,
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.120]   may be found to result in praise and glory and honor
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.240]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.360]   Lord, help us to take to heart your encouragement,
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.000]   your warning, your challenge,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.740]   that we may truly pursue the things that are eternal.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.600]   Help us, Lord God,
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.700]   not to be entangled with civilian affairs.
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.600]   Help us, Lord God, so that our gaze and our heart
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.720]   will be taken away from this world
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.540]   and to be firmly placed in Christ.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.440]   Help us, Lord, to live truly worthy of the gospel
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.320]   that you've given us, so that wherever you send us,
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.640]   that we will be the aroma of Christ
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.320]   that you have intended for us to be.
