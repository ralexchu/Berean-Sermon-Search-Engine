[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13, we're going to finally finish
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:18.960]   the second part that we started a couple weeks ago.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.200]   We're focused on verse 9 obviously, but I want to read it in context, verse 7, 8, and
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   9.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   Hebrews chapter 13, verses 7, 8, and 9.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.160]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.700]   Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you, and considering the result
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.380]   of their conduct, imitate their faith.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.000]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.760]   Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.880]   be strengthened by grace, not by foods through which those who are so occupied were not benefited.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.520]   Let's pray.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.680]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come before you
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   in worship.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   We ask, Lord God, that you would soften our hearts, open our ears, that we may remember
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.200]   and to give you praise for all the grace that you've given us that we do not deserve.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.040]   We pray, Father God, for your kindness, your presence with us.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.920]   You know, I know most of you guys who celebrated Thanksgiving with your family and all that
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.600]   entails with all the family members gathering together, the food that you eat, and sometimes
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.800]   we celebrate and at the end of our celebration we're so tired that we're ready to go back
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.360]   to whatever is normal.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.040]   But when you think about the purpose of these gatherings, the purpose of holidays, is to
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.960]   kind of take a break for us to remember, to celebrate, rest, maybe even recuperate so
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.880]   that we can get back to work.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.760]   You know, but a lot of times the way that we practice these holidays, it does exactly
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   the opposite.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.480]   We get so tired that we need to take a break from the break that we took, you know.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.240]   And so this time of the season is typically we can kind of get burnt out because we have
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.120]   Thanksgiving, we have Christmas, and then after Christmas you have New Year's.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.280]   And so when New Year's come around you kind of have a big sigh of relief, it's like, oh,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.320]   we can get back to normal because all this stuff is, you know, behind us.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.920]   Obviously that was not the intent of that, but as human beings we have a tendency to
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.680]   make what was intended for rest and recuperation into work.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.860]   And that's exactly what Jesus said to the Pharisees when they made the Sabbath work
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.760]   and they were so meticulous about keeping the Sabbath and who's breaking it and who's
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.680]   not breaking it and who's keeping it right.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880]   And when Jesus showed up, he said, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.400]   The whole purpose of the Sabbath was to give you rest and you made it into more work than
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.620]   even before."
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.400]   So we have a tendency as Christians to do exactly that.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.640]   God gave us life and he said to give it abundantly.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.320]   But if you've been a Christian for a while, if we're not careful, we can easily turn all
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.560]   of our service, all of our worship, giving sacrifice into labor and work.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.360]   And so if you're not careful, when you think of church, it's a place to work.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.080]   It's not a place where you find rest, right?
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.360]   You go hiking and take trips for rest, but then we've got to get back to work when we
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   come to church.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.200]   But when you look in the scripture, it says he came so that he can give us rest.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.280]   Are we truly experiencing that rest?
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.660]   Have we come this morning because this is where we truly find life?
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.200]   Or have we made it into a Sabbath of works where we just need to get going?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.940]   There's a tendency, especially in our generation, that we think that if we preach too much about
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.420]   grace it's going to lead to cheap grace, licentiousness.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.700]   Or maybe some of you in here says if we emphasize too much on holiness, it's going to lead to
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.640]   legalism.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.020]   And so because of fear of cheap grace and because of fear of legalism, we kind of end
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.660]   up over-embracing one or the other, and then we kind of teeter-totter back and forth.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500]   And I've mentioned that in the first sermon.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.420]   But the scripture is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.580]   God never does anything where he compromises either.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.580]   So the text that we're looking at where he says, "Do not be carried away by varied and
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.600]   strange teaching," the varied and strange teaching that predominantly was affecting
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.040]   the church was legalism or cheap grace.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.100]   And they're going back and forth, back and forth.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.100]   And he says here, "For it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not foods,
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.580]   and through those which those were so occupied were not benefited."
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.860]   They worked so hard to be righteous by their own standards, but they didn't benefit from
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.180]   that.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.660]   So therefore he says, "Be strengthened."
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.540]   In other words, to live righteously, pursue holiness, he said, "But by the grace of God."
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.180]   God will never compromise his grace or his holiness.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.740]   And whenever we catch ourselves doing one or the other, we know that we've strayed.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.080]   Grace will never compromise righteousness, and righteousness never compromises grace.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.060]   Because to compromise either is to negate the necessity of the cross.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.120]   If you emphasize grace without righteousness, there's no need for the cross.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.500]   If you emphasize righteousness without grace, again, there's no need for the cross.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.220]   The cross is a perfect union where neither his grace or his righteousness is compromised.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.900]   The early church wrestled with this because people who are hearing this and saying either
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.140]   they emphasize grace, so let us sin so grace may abound.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.300]   Jude actually mentions that in verse Jude 4 when he says, "For certain persons have
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.140]   crept in unnoticed, those who are long before marked out for this condemnation, ungodly
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.820]   persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.180]   Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.660]   So this is a struggle from the very get-go.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.500]   Because salvation was by grace, well if it's by grace, then it doesn't matter.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.700]   And we have people who think like that today.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.460]   Since it is by grace, we should be righteous, and it'd be good if we were taking the commandments
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.100]   of God seriously, but even if we don't, one saved always saved.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.380]   And we kind of cling on to these cliches and turn the grace of God into licentiousness.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.500]   First Peter 2.16 again says, "Act as free men, men who have been freed from the law,
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.060]   and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bond slaves of God."
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.060]   I don't know how many people that I've talked to in our generation where they're talking
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.380]   about the freedom in Christ, and that their freedom means that they can do whatever they
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.620]   want because we're free.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.980]   And the scripture clearly says, "Do not use your freedom for licentiousness."
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.300]   If you want to know what God thinks about this cheap grace, it's spelled out in 2 Peter
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.580]   2.19-22, "Promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption, for by
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.880]   what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.300]   For if after they have escaped the defilement of the world by the knowledge of the Lord
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.260]   and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.180]   become worse for them than the first.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.500]   For would it be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.000]   known it, turn away from the holy commandment, hand it on to them?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.100]   It has happened to them according to the true proverb."
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.100]   And look what he says here.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.540]   I mean this is probably one of the harshest criticism in the New Testament.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.180]   "A dog returns to his own vomit, and is so after washing, returns to wallowing in the
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.180]   mire."
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.660]   I mean that's a pretty vivid image of a dog going back to its vomit.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:53.020]   And that's how he describes somebody who turns the grace of God into licentiousness.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.740]   Faith without deeds is dead faith.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.300]   You can say whatever you want, you can proclaim whatever you want, you can sign whatever doctrine
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.660]   that you want, but if your life contradicts your faith, it says it's dead.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.400]   What it means by it's dead is it's not saving faith.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.300]   You have faith that's the same faith that the demons do, and yet they shudder in fear
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.460]   because there's no fruit that comes from that.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.580]   Billy Graham years ago, probably, there is no argument with this, that he probably preached
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:29.500]   the gospel to more people than any other human being alive, in number.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.300]   It's somewhere in the millions.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.060]   He was able to at least preach the gospel through his crusades and years of ministry
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.380]   that he did.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.520]   But years ago, Billy Graham began to notice something in his ministry that was very concerning
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.980]   to him, and according to their own statistics, that out of hundreds and thousands of people
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:54.820]   who made commitments of faith during these crusades, they found out that over 94% of
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.460]   them, after they make their commitment of faith, never make it to church.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.460]   94%.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.540]   That means only 6% of the people who raised their hand, came down, accepted Jesus Christ,
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.540]   ever continued to walk after that.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.660]   So you have hundreds and thousands of people walking around, one saved, always saved, and
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.900]   hearing these cliches, and never actually understand what it means to live according
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.060]   to all that I have commanded you, because they never made it to church.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.660]   And the statistics are actually even more dire than that, because they said that of
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.660]   the 6% who made it to church, only a very small percentage of that made it after the
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.740]   first year.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.220]   So you have all these people walking around, like, "We're saved by grace.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.420]   God loved us unconditionally."
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.420]   And that's all they know.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.860]   Again, it's not false, but it's not complete.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.220]   And as a result of that, we have what we have in our generation.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.760]   Again, I'm not saying Billy Graham, it's just the way that we've done evangelism today that
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.900]   has brought a lot of confusion.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.880]   In fact, I had a pastor say to me years ago that he was so frustrated with the way that
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.320]   our faith is being practiced, that it was just cheap grace, licentiousness, and he said,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.020]   at one point he said, "You know, we need some more legalism in order to balance out the
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.100]   cheap grace."
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.700]   I remember when he said that, I was in agreement.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.460]   Yes, I'm so frustrated that this is...Christianity that I know of what I see in Scripture doesn't
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.180]   look like what we see in our generation.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.780]   But as the years passed by, I realized just how wrong that is, because legalism is just
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:33.380]   as sinful as licentiousness, because in the early church, that was their primary battle.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.920]   The whole book of Galatians is to combat legalism.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.580]   So we don't combat false teaching with another false teaching to try to balance that.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.200]   In fact, I think what we need in our generation is to truly understand when the Bible says
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.120]   grace, what that grace means, and how we are to be empowered by that grace.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.420]   So we don't balance each other by doing...because it's legalism, we're going to fall to licentiousness
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.600]   or cheap grace.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.960]   Because we're concerned about cheap grace, we're going to go to legalism.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.840]   I think the answer to that is the Bible, that we need to get into Scripture, make sure that
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   we understand when we say grace, that we are practicing what the Bible says grace is, and
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.360]   what it's supposed to do.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.320]   So a couple of weeks ago, we started out with four points.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.720]   I only did two.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.440]   So let me review the first two, and then we'll get to the third point today.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.040]   And I promise I will finish today.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.680]   First one, we talked about how does grace strengthen us?
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.080]   It empties us of our pride.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.920]   It completely empties us of our pride.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.180]   So every single individual that comes to church, our beginning point is the same.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.160]   Whether you are Nicodemus, or whether you are the Samaritan woman, the entrance into
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.480]   the kingdom is the same.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.080]   The hearty needs to be humbled, the humble need to be brought up, but the entrance is
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.960]   the same.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.840]   You know the passage, Ephesians 2, 8, 9, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.880]   and that not of yourselves, it is a gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.400]   one may boast."
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:09.360]   So the first thing that it does, it gets rid of any human pride, any human glory.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.520]   It gets rid of that.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:19.440]   You know, years ago, many of you know that during a period of our church, I had to run
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.720]   a business out in Vegas.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.640]   And again, I'm not going to go into the details of what happened there, but for that year,
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.760]   I learned something that I'm very thankful that I was able to be there for that period,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.840]   even though it was difficult.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.600]   Because one of the things that I observed while I was there was the different groups
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.200]   of people that came into town.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.260]   What's unique about Vegas is they would have large conventions.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.640]   And so the conventions would, you know, sometimes would have 5,000, 4,000, but sometimes they
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.000]   would have large conventions where somewhere around 30 to, if it's a large convention,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.720]   100,000 people would come into town, all in the same industry.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.360]   And there's two groups of people that we all hated when they came into town.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.920]   The first group were the salespeople.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.740]   So if you're in sales, I apologize.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.200]   This does not apply to you.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.160]   It applies to all your friends.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.440]   So whenever they would come into town, they're just so obnoxious because everybody is selling
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.840]   themselves.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   I haven't met a single person who didn't do at least a million dollars or $10 million
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.480]   sales, right?
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.760]   They wear $5 shoes, but then they did $10 million sales.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.440]   And so they're always trying to sell something.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.520]   And so they're not bad people, but just obnoxious.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.680]   You never feel like you're talking to the real person.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.640]   That's the one group of people.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.400]   The other group of people that would come to town was the TV executives.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.680]   And they were the worst.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.400]   Again, if you happen to be a TV executive, I'm not talking about you.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.320]   I'm talking about everybody else around you at work, okay?
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.000]   When these guys would come to town, I think they're so used to bossing people around,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.640]   you know, and they're making power decisions.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.960]   And these are decisions that they make over celebrities.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.400]   And so they kind of had this paradigm that everybody was below them.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.480]   So again, if you see one or two of them, you kind of say, "Wow, they're jerks."
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.640]   But when you see a convention come in and you see 30,000, 40,000 of them, nobody wanted
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.600]   to be around because everybody was, you're getting ordered.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.120]   And they calculate every single penny.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.680]   And so there was kind of like all our coworkers when we were working out there, like we just
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.720]   hated when that week came around because we knew we were going to be cranky at the end
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.440]   of that, you know?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.820]   But the main reason why that was, was because they were just filled with pride.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:41.280]   And when you're around with a lot of people who are filled with pride, they're just miserable.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.400]   But there was one group of people that would come into town we all looked forward to, and
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.320]   they were the cowboys.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.060]   You know, they would typically come to some sort of a NASCAR convention or something.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.360]   And it was a big, one of the biggest conventions that would come into town.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.520]   And over 100,000 of them would come in.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.320]   And when the cowboys came into town, it was party time, you know, because they're not,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.720]   they weren't rich.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.360]   They knew that this convention was coming and they saved all year.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.840]   And so when they came into town, they were just happy to be there.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.400]   So they were generous and they knew that they only had a short period, so they're going
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.020]   to live this up.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.260]   And anybody that was around just partied with them.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.720]   Just humble guys who, you know, blue collar workers just knew that this was their special
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.120]   time and they're just going to enjoy it.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.720]   There's no ego.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.200]   And so we did the best sales during that time, you know, got the best tips.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.440]   And these guys just wanted to hang out with you, you know, and all of it because there's
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.160]   no ego.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.080]   They just came in, saved up all year, and they're just going to come in and have fun
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.700]   and they want you to have fun.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.640]   But I remember that the primary difference between the people who came and the people
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.200]   that we enjoyed and people who didn't, who came in that we didn't enjoy, all had to do
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.980]   with their attitudes.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.880]   People who were filled with pride, right?
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.960]   You see one or two of them, now you try to avoid them.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.920]   The whole convention comes into town.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.400]   You can't avoid that, right?
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.280]   But when the cowboys were in, it was, you know, we all became cowboys for a period,
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   right?
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.960]   The church, if we're not careful, we can turn the church into a measurement of righteousness.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.240]   And everybody's looking at each other, who's doing what, who's not doing what, and it becomes
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.020]   a miserable place when we are not strengthened and moved by the grace of God.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.740]   We forget how we got here.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.280]   We weren't just justified by grace.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   We are also being sanctified by the grace of God.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.600]   When that becomes the primary motivation, primary thing that we sing about, it changes
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.160]   the culture of the church.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.880]   Sad thing to say that years ago, I went to a pastor's convention out in Kentucky.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.040]   I mean, some of you guys know, you know, what convention I may be talking about.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.320]   And this was like 3,000, 4,000 pastors were in town.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.960]   And this was the second year, second time we were having this convention.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.880]   And the leader of the convention, as we were starting, had to address the pastors and say,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.300]   after the first convention, there was a lot of complaint in town that all these pastors
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.100]   were acting obnoxiously and that they were rude to the workers there.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.800]   And so they had to tell us that you guys left a pretty bad taste in the mouth of the workers
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   here.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.960]   And so they were cautioning us that to be a better witness.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.520]   And this wasn't just a gathering of a bunch of Christians.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.160]   This was a gathering of pastors.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:41.040]   And obviously, we were all rebuked, and everybody acted extra nice and left big, fat tips to
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:47.120]   combat whatever it was, the negative thing that we've left behind the couple years before.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.280]   But the fact that they even had to remind us of that says a lot about where we're at.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.680]   That we can get so caught up in this business of Christianity that the end result doesn't
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.480]   turn into praise and glory to God, but it becomes a heavy burden.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.440]   Just like we celebrate Thanksgiving, at the end of it, it's like, oh, thank God it's over.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.320]   It didn't actually recuperate or strengthen or remind.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.720]   Rather, it's like, OK, we're done with it.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.440]   And sometimes we can approach our Christian faith that way.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.800]   We're done with Bible study.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   We're done with fellowship.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   We're done with that.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.680]   And then where we find rest is we travel.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   We go things.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   We have a bucket list.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.440]   And that's where we find rest.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.720]   This is where we come to get burdened at the work.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:37.400]   If we're not strengthened by grace and our starting and continuing point isn't grace,
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.440]   we can easily turn into that.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.200]   Secondly, to be strengthened by grace is to have absolute security in our salvation.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.680]   That we're not constantly wondering back and forth every time we struggle and every time
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   we're righteous, that we are filled with pride or filled with fear.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.440]   Isaiah 41.10 is that, "Do not fear, for I am with you.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.360]   Do not be anxious and look about you, for I am your God.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360]   I will strengthen you.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   Surely I will help you.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.720]   Surely I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.240]   You and I are in a covenant relationship with God.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.680]   That's why whenever two people get married, we remind them that this covenant is not dependent
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.480]   upon one person's faithfulness or the other.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.640]   God's calling to the husband and the wife is unilateral.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.360]   As he loved us, we love our wives.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.200]   As he loved us, we love our husband.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.080]   It's unconditional.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.360]   And so that's not broken because of unfaithfulness of one or the other.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.320]   That's what a covenant is to symbolize.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.600]   I think the best way to describe that, where we find strength and security, is, you know,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.200]   when you're dating and you get in a fight, and some of you guys may be in a dating situation
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.640]   now, maybe this is very personal to you, but when you're dating and you get in a fight,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:53.260]   every fight is dangerous because there's always this nervousness that, "Is this going to lead
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.160]   to a breakup?"
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.200]   And so you have to make sure, and you're putting out the best foot, and every fight becomes
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.400]   something much more serious.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.760]   And I'm not saying that if you get married, you know, fighting is okay, but there's a
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.360]   piece that you have that when you have disagreements with your wife in a covenant relationship,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.440]   because you know at the end of the day, you're going to end up going back to the same house,
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.160]   right, sleeping on the same bed.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.320]   And so you know that that bond is not easily broken because of this covenant relationship
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.000]   that God places on us in our marriage.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.680]   And in the same way, our marriage is a reflection of the covenant that God made with us.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.480]   And that's why in Isaiah, he says, "I will uphold you, I will strengthen you, I will
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.560]   hold on to you."
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.240]   And so our relationship does not teeter back and forth between being saved and unsaved,
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.320]   being saved and unsaved because of what you and I do.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.240]   God made a unilateral commitment to us, and so we have that security.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.600]   And so that's how we are strengthened, number two.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.200]   And here's where I left off, number three.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.520]   To be strengthened by grace means we are being equipped for good works.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.240]   Let me say it another way.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.000]   Grace leads to righteousness.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.400]   It's not righteousness that leads to grace.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.640]   Grace is what fuels us for good works.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   So again, we have a tendency, if we're not careful, that we start with justification
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.040]   by grace, but when it comes to sanctification, we really have to be committed and to be discipled
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.120]   and disciplined and shamed and taught and equipped.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.320]   And so we have a tendency to start with the grace of God, and the rest of it, I'm going
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.440]   to have to work hard.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.600]   Paul addresses that in Galatians 3, 1-3, when he says, "You foolish Galatians, who has
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.480]   bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified, this
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.560]   is the only thing I want to find out from you.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.120]   Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?"
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.760]   In other words, justification.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.720]   Did it happen by faith or by works?
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.440]   Of course, by faith.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.920]   Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:12.680]   If you started by faith, you continue by faith, and you will finish by faith.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:23.480]   What he means by this is, people who tend to be focused on their will, their discipline
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.600]   for righteousness in their sanctification, usually ends up becoming either self-righteous
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   or self-condemning.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.900]   You will be one or the other.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.880]   If you're working hard by your own effort, you will eventually, it may not happen immediately,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.360]   but eventually, it leads to self-righteousness, where you measure everybody based upon your
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.120]   righteous standard.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.040]   So whatever you're good at, you're frustrated that other people aren't as good as you.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.680]   And then when you don't live up to even your own standard, you go into self-condemnation.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.600]   And you teeter back, back and forth, back and forth.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.560]   Then eventually you get burned out, because it doesn't bear true fruit.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.640]   Some of the most bitterest and angriest people are the people who used to serve in the church
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.320]   faithfully for a long time.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   And they got frustrated.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   They got angry.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.600]   I did this, and they didn't acknowledge me.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.920]   I gave so much, but they didn't give back to me.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.080]   How come I'm the only one serving?
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.800]   How come I'm the only one doing this?
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.240]   And eventually, their frustration, either self-righteousness, and when they don't live
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:31.160]   up to it, they lead to self-condemnation, but they don't last long.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.320]   So he says, we started by faith, and we will continue by faith.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:42.960]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 9, 8, "And God is able to make all grace abound to you."
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.920]   He's able to make all grace abound to you, "so that always having all sufficiency in
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.400]   everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed."
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.520]   So why is grace abounding?
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:00.240]   "So that you may have all sufficiency to do what?
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.960]   So that you can have good deeds."
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:10.760]   So he says, the purpose of grace is not simply to free you from the penalty of sin.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:16.520]   The purpose of grace is to free you from the penalty of sin, and to equip you so that you
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.840]   can do good works.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   First Corinthians 15, 10, "But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace toward
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   me was not in vain."
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.120]   So I want you to pay attention to that.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.200]   What would it mean?
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.120]   What does Paul mean here, that grace be in vain?
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.600]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.400]   of God that is with me.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:48.320]   So in other words, he says, grace would be in vain if it didn't lead to greater work
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.040]   for God, greater righteousness.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.960]   Because we have a tendency to think grace is applied when we are not working, when we
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.760]   are not laboring, when we are not pursuing righteousness.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.160]   And then when we're pursuing righteousness, it's our discipline, it's our work.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.800]   But Paul says, grace of God was not in vain because the evidence of God's grace is what
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.960]   caused me to work harder than anybody else.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   Ephesians 2, 8 through 10, this is a passage that we sing about grace of God.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.600]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.400]   It is a gift of God, not as a result of work, so that no one may boast."
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.600]   But then he says in verse 10, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   what?
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:38.320]   Good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.840]   He says he humbles us, he saves us for what purpose?
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   For good works.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.960]   So our salvation isn't simply being saved from hell.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.000]   That is a byproduct of what he's doing, but his ultimate goal is to restore us back to
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.460]   good works.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.400]   And when did he plan this?
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.640]   He says from the beginning.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:06.200]   So good works and righteousness and holiness is not a byproduct, it's not something extra.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:14.280]   He said from the very get-go, he says, righteousness and good works is the intent of our salvation.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.120]   From the get-go.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:22.040]   You see why when you either fall on legalism or cheap grace, that's not the gospel?
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.920]   It's not the complete gospel?
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:30.460]   Paul says that we have been gripped by this.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:37.440]   You know, in the early church, the Judaizers who embraced Christ's forgiveness, and yet
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.960]   they were saying, "No, you need to be a Jew.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.440]   You need to still keep the Sabbath.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.480]   You need to still keep circumcision and all of this."
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:51.520]   They're saying, "Well, if true salvation is by grace alone, then are you saying that we
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.280]   should sin so that grace may abound?"
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.880]   He says in Romans 6, 1-7, "What shall we say then?
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.420]   Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.760]   May it never be."
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.840]   I think some of you translated it, it says, "By no means."
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.520]   Or modern translation, "Are you kidding me?
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.960]   You know anything about who God is?
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.320]   By no means.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.740]   If you've really been crucified with Christ, how can you continue to live like you've never
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.960]   been crucified?
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.320]   For do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.880]   baptized into his death?
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.040]   Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that Christ, who raised
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.320]   from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in the newness of life."
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.980]   The whole reason why we baptize in the way that we do is because the symbolism of that
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.880]   is death and resurrection.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.760]   That's why we don't sprinkle at our church, because that's what it says.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.680]   It signifies that we are dead in Christ, we are buried in Christ, and then we are resurrected
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.600]   as Christ was resurrected in verse 4, verse 5.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.380]   "For if we have become united with him in his likeness of his death, certainly we shall
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.480]   also be like in the likeness of his resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.200]   with him in order that our body of sin might be done away with so that we would no longer
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:18.400]   be slaves to sin, for he who has died is freed from sin."
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.560]   Let me ask you this question.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.720]   We were studying through the book of Titus, and we had a brief discussion about this in
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:32.280]   our home group leaders meeting, but oftentimes people think of justification in an incomplete
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.800]   manner, and it doesn't make any sense if you don't really understand the whole context
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.000]   of justification.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.040]   Because when we think about justification, we probably have heard that maybe you committed
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.800]   murder or something, right?
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.000]   And you deserve the death penalty, and that was a sentence that was given to you.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And the judge, who happened to be compassionate, steps in and says, "I will take that punishment
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.160]   so that you can go."
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.880]   So the judge takes the punishment upon himself, and the murderer ends up leaving to live his
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   life.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   A lot of people think that that's the totality of what justification is.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:18.800]   Now if that was all of what justification is, did a good thing happen?
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:25.200]   Because that murderer had no penalty, went out to do whatever he wants, and the righteous
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.460]   judge got punished.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.240]   Who would look at that situation in life and say, "That was good"?
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   Would you?
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.560]   Would you look at that and say, "That murderer who deserved to be punished, and yet the judge
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:46.360]   got the punishment, and all these people were just walked out, never committing or being
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.320]   in jail at all, no punishment whatsoever, and we celebrate that and say, 'Wow, that's
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.800]   so loving, that's so gracious.'"
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.760]   Who would think that he's a good judge by just letting them go?
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.920]   There's a crucial part of that that a lot of people don't understand, which leads to
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.900]   cheap grace.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.960]   It wasn't that sinner that was let go.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.600]   The Bible says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.840]   The old has gone, behold, a new has come."
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.680]   He said, "Their old self has been crucified with Christ.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.600]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.120]   So when we get baptized, it's symbolic of our old self dying, that it completely renewed
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.280]   who we are.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:36.240]   So it wasn't that same sinner, it wasn't that same person who was judged to eternal
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.280]   damnation, our whole destiny changed because our whole identity and who we are has changed.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.840]   And only then we can say the righteous thing happened because that old self died, and the
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.540]   new self walked out.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:56.140]   But if it's the old self, and all that happened was that the penalty of sin was paid for,
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:01.080]   so you can go out and do whatever you want, so now you're covered by the blood of Christ,
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.980]   so do whatever you want.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.080]   That is not the complete picture of justification.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.780]   Justification tells us that we are crucified with Christ.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.640]   Our old self is done.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.040]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.080]   He explains it a little bit further in Romans 6, 15-18, "What then, shall we sin because
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.360]   we are not under law, but under grace?
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.300]   May it never be.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.720]   Do you not know that when you present yourself to someone as slaves or obedient, you are
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.000]   slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death or of obedience resulting
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.640]   in righteousness?
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   But thanks be to God that through you, though you were slaves to sin, you became obedient
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.040]   from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.600]   And having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness."
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.160]   Not only were we freed from the slavery of sin and condemnation, he says, now we become
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.280]   slaves to righteousness.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.720]   Now that sounds good in theology, but in practice, what does that look like?
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.960]   Because I know we all still struggle.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.680]   I think the best way to illustrate this is from my own life.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.000]   I remember, and again, I've shared this before, but I remember when I first became a Christian,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.720]   I was so excited about my faith.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.560]   But after months have gone by, I started struggling with the same things over and again.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:35.200]   My temper, you know, like I was getting into fights, purity issues, and every Friday I'm
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.960]   going praying and praying.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.580]   And after about seven, eight, nine months of this and getting into fights and disappointing
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.280]   my mom again, and I just couldn't do it anymore.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.160]   Not because I was tempted by the world, but I was just frustrated with myself.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.680]   I was so determined to prove specifically to my mom that I was a different person, and
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.640]   I kept on falling into the same sin, and I just kind of let it go.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.200]   So I just walked out, and I just started to backslide and do whatever I wanted.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.880]   And I had some friends who, you know, was doing whatever they wanted and happened to
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   have some money.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.160]   So I remember during that period, about a year and a year and a half, I was backsliding
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.240]   and going to parties and getting drunk, and I was starting to do things that I didn't
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.400]   do before because I was a bit older.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   But I remember the whole time being at parties, getting drunk with my friends, and never feeling
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.960]   like I belonged here.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:39.200]   And every opportunity I had, I would start to tell them about God at parties while I'm
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.080]   getting drunk.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   And I knew how that sounded.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.360]   So you're getting drunk, you're doing everything that they're doing, and they said, "Yeah,
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   but you know, I got saved.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   You know, I met God.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   He's real.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.520]   You know, I know what I'm doing is stupid, but one day I'm going to have to go back,
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.680]   and this is not who I am."
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.040]   I'm telling them this is not who I am, even though I was acting like it.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.120]   And I never felt like I belonged.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.840]   And the funny thing was, the only people that I really connected with were the other Christians
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.780]   who were also backsliding.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.840]   And we would sit there while we're doing stupid things and talking about how, "Well, how did
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.400]   you get saved?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.960]   And how did I get saved?"
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.240]   And then we would connect with each other and always tell us that one of these days
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.920]   we're going to have to go back, one of these days we're going to have to go back, because
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.800]   we weren't the same person.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.000]   You know, I went and tried to go back and embrace that life, but I just was not the
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.440]   same person anymore.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.320]   And so at one point, I made a decision.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.640]   We had a crazy night, you know, we almost got arrested.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.360]   I won't get into all the stories, but by the time I got home, three in the morning, I was
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:58.560]   sitting there, slowly starting to sober up, talking to myself, "Is this fun for you?"
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.120]   And I was talking to myself.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.080]   "This is so stupid.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.720]   This is not who you are."
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   And so I made a decision.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.880]   It wasn't like a fantastic decision.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.280]   There was no tears coming down my face.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.000]   I just made a decision.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.960]   I'd rather at least face the right direction than to continue to do what I'm doing now,
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.440]   because this is not who I am.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.760]   That's all it was.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.240]   I just made a decision.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:28.800]   And I remember at that time, if God didn't make me a new creature, if I was able to walk
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.680]   away from God, I would have.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.200]   I would have many times.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.400]   I remember even in ministry, there were times when I just want to quit.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.920]   And I remember, you know, I was ready to just pack it up.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:49.280]   And something simple that my mom and my wife Esther said the exact same thing.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.440]   And I know they wanted me to quit more than anybody else.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.280]   And I remember saying this to Esther, it's like, "If you want," you know, like I've reached
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.520]   my end.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.080]   And then I remember specifically Esther's telling me, "I know you."
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.200]   As much as I don't want to do it anymore either, I know you.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.400]   If you quit, you're not going to be able to be okay and live another life.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.640]   And she was absolutely right.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:23.320]   As much as I may be tempted and frustrated sometimes, God gave me a new...
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.600]   He made me a new creature.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.080]   I don't find life out there.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.960]   I don't find peace in money.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.260]   I don't find peace, even though there might be periods when I'm tempted and frustrated.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.960]   But who I am, He's God made me to function in the light.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.800]   So my life doesn't feel comfortable in the darkness anymore.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.960]   Even though at times I may be tempted, I may be frustrated to run to it.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:54.360]   If you are a new creation, you're no longer a slave to sin, but He made you a slave to
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:00.760]   righteousness where you can do no other than to follow Christ.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:05.400]   Even though at times you may be kicking and screaming, but if you are a new creation in
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.600]   Christ, you only find peace when you are near Christ.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   Because your eyes no longer function well in darkness.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.640]   Because He made it new.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:22.800]   And so when you make decisions, when you try to live in darkness, you're fumbling through
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.520]   the night, banging your knees against walls.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.920]   And you second guessing every decision that you make because you weren't meant to function
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.240]   in darkness.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.440]   You and I have been made new creation.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.080]   That's what that means to be strengthened by grace.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:45.000]   It is the grace of God that caused me to persevere.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It's the grace of God that caused me to love.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.160]   It's the grace of God that caused me to sacrifice.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.320]   It's the grace of God that caused me to worship.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:01.240]   And fourthly, it's the grace of God that caused me to proclaim His word with boldness.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   That's the fourth point.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.960]   To be strengthened by grace gives us boldness to proclaim the gospel.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:16.400]   You know, when the apostles stood, risked their lives to preach the gospel, people didn't
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.480]   observe their education or their great training or discipleship.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.400]   In fact, they observed exactly the opposite.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.680]   It says in Acts 4.13, "Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.000]   that they were uneducated and untrained."
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.200]   Stop right there.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   Think about that.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.800]   You know, a lot of the secular scholars will say that the apostles manipulated the New
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.240]   Testament for their own benefit.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:51.560]   So they made up the resurrection to venerate Jesus for their own benefit.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:57.040]   If that's what they did, the New Testament is ... they're the dumbest people in the world.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.360]   Because they made them look so foolish.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.520]   The text that they manipulated for their own glory says that they were rebuked by Paul
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:13.140]   publicly, that the women came to the grave before they did, and when Jesus was standing
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.600]   before them, they had a hard time believing.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.400]   I mean, if they did this for their own glory, they sure did a bad job.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.940]   Here it says, "They were uneducated and untrained men.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.480]   They were amazed and began to recognize them as having been," what?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.900]   With Jesus.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.020]   Their boldness didn't come because of training.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.320]   Their boldness didn't come because of the education or their experience.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.860]   All it says was their boldness came because they saw that boldness in Jesus.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.160]   And they were remaining with Christ.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   Just as Jesus told them in John 15.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   When I go, if you want to bear fruit, you remain in me.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   And that's what they said.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.960]   They recognized these uneducated, untrained men.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.440]   They were with Jesus.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.720]   It was the grace of God that gave them the boldness to proclaim the truth.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   That's why it says in 1 Corinthians 1, 18-19, "For the word of the cross is foolishness
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.000]   to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.600]   For it is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the cleverness of the clever.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.040]   I will set aside.'"
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.400]   Our boldness does not come because we're very well educated or you took some evangelism
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.200]   class and all of these things are the grace of God, right?
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.480]   These are all beneficial, but that's not where our effectiveness come from.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.760]   Our effectiveness comes from being affected by the grace of God.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   The reason why sometimes we feel so inadequate is because we have drifted from His grace.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:50.800]   Being strengthened by the grace of God are people who have been enamored with Christ.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.340]   Remember when you first came to Christ, you know who are the most bold for their faith?
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.120]   Not the people who went to seminary.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.040]   I've been there.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.120]   Not the people who are the most well-equipped.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.240]   You know who are the most bold for the kingdom of God?
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.160]   Brand new Christians.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.460]   They don't know about the theology.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.560]   They don't know about dispensation of covenant theology.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.040]   They don't know anything about that.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.320]   But they're the boldest for the kingdom of God.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.560]   You know why?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.920]   Because they have been deeply affected by God's grace and they're eager to tell other
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.440]   people about it.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:31.760]   You know the best salesmen are not the people who have the best personalities or best techniques.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.560]   The best salesmen are the people who believe in that product.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.000]   So when you watch a movie, right, I'm going to say, "Oh, I'm an introvert.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   I don't tell people."
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.800]   It has nothing to do with your personality.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.960]   When you watch a movie and you like it, people find out about it.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.360]   I remember a couple of years ago after the retreat, some people said that we have to
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.640]   go to this place in LA to eat some tacos.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.220]   It was in the middle of nowhere.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.480]   We thought we were going to die that day.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.280]   You know, literally, it was like an abandoned area of an industrial area in LA somewhere,
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.120]   and then some people said that they ate it and it was the best tacos that they had in
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.120]   LA.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   So we were curious.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.880]   So we drove out there and said, "We must be lost because everything's shut down."
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.640]   You know, this is the kind of place where you get jumped.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.280]   And so we made that and we turned this corner.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.880]   All of a sudden, this taco stands there and all these people, right, are coming.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.160]   I said, "Where are these people coming from?
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.680]   I've never heard of them, never seen an advertisement.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.760]   There's no commercial I saw.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.720]   But we're willing to risk our lives to eat these tacos."
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   Why did we go?
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.440]   Because some people ate it and they told us it was good.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.040]   It was worth the drive.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:53.400]   The best witnesses for Christ are not the most educated, are not the best trained, are
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.640]   people who have been deeply affected by the grace of God.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.840]   And you can't help tell other people because it's just overflowing in you.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.700]   And that's where the boldness comes from.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.000]   Boldness does not come from years of training or education.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.440]   Boldness comes from you believing with all your heart.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.900]   And that's why Jesus says, "The greatest commandment is love the Lord your God with
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.000]   all your heart, soul, mind, and strength."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.120]   Because that's where love of your neighbors comes from.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   That's where sacrifice comes from.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.080]   That's where true praise comes from.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.960]   That's where evangelism comes from.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.800]   Brethren you and I have been deeply affected by the love of Christ.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.200]   It is His grace that strengthens us.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.280]   That's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, 1 through 5, "And when I came to you, brethren,
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.640]   I did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom or proclaiming to you the testimony
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   of God.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:52.200]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified."
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.200]   I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my message and my preaching
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.360]   were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.560]   so that your faith would not rest on wisdom of men but on the power of God.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.360]   You know sometimes people would look at that and say, "Oh, demonstration of Spirit and
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.160]   power like He was performing miracles."
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.760]   That's not what He's referring to.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.440]   He's talking about His own testimony.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   Look at the text of that.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.380]   He's not talking about supernatural power where He raised people from the dead.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:30.260]   He's talking about His own witness of how God saved a sinner like Him.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.860]   And that was the power of God that downfounded the wisdom of mankind.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:41.640]   That the weakness of man, weakness of man, the weakness of God is much more powerful
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.240]   than the greatest power of man.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:50.620]   That's why He said, "I resolved to know nothing but Christ crucified."
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:56.120]   If we've drifted away, if we've frustrated or if the work of God or church has become
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:01.880]   burdensome, maybe it's because we have drifted away from the grace of God.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.440]   That we've forgotten what we have been saved from and what it is that we have been saved
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   to.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.980]   That if there's anything that we need to prioritize in our life is to get back and
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:19.360]   to refocus and recommit to the grace of God so that the grace of God would empower us,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.720]   strengthen us, humble us, revive us, renew us, secure us so that we may find strength
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   in Him and Him alone.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:34.600]   So as we enter into this busy season of Christmas, right, you're probably already decorating
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.080]   your homes and already burdened by the gifts that you need to buy.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.680]   Maybe you already feel behind because you missed the Black Friday sale.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.520]   You know, and then you have all these things that you need to get done before Christmas
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:52.200]   comes and in the midst of our busyness to really consider why do we have this day as
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.640]   Christians, right?
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.040]   That we don't celebrate it like the rest of the world.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:04.000]   That it truly would function to recalibrate our hearts to know that the Son of God came,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.300]   took on human form, humbled Himself to save us.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:16.960]   How should believers who believe that respond to that?
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:23.480]   Let's take some time to pray again as we ask our worship team to come.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:33.080]   Just take some time to really reflect, to celebrate, to rest, to recuperate.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.240]   Focus on the grace of God that has been given to us.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
