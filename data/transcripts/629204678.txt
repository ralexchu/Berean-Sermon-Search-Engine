[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.440]   We're going to read one verse this morning.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   Yeah, one verse.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.840]   And I'm going to just give you a heads up.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.440]   There's things that I'm going to say this morning is going to offend some of you.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.280]   And so this is not going to be one of those lighthearted messages, but I wanted to take
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.480]   this time to address certain things that are going on in our culture that is important.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.680]   And we wanted to make sure, and I'm sure it's not anything new to you, but I think it is
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680]   important for us to address this going forward.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.080]   And knowing that there is a fight for biblical marriage in our generation that we really
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.320]   need to be aware of and to participate in.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.200]   So let me read this text and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.320]   Verse four, marriage is to be held in honor among all and the marriage bed is to be undefiled
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.720]   for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.280]   Let's pray.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   Heavenly Father, we pray for wisdom.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   We pray for truth.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.260]   We pray for love.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.860]   We pray, Father God, for your Holy Spirit to guide us.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.880]   And I know, Lord, that your word will cut us.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.800]   It will judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.200]   But we pray, Father God, that as your word guides and leads us, that ultimately it would
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.120]   bring us to true life.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.280]   Asking for your grace, asking that you would protect our church, this generation, Lord
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.520]   God, that we may be the light that you've called us to be.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.360]   So we pray for your spirit's guidance.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.560]   Amen.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:00.880]   I think you will all agree that some of your best memories from your childhood will probably
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.360]   be from your family interaction with your parents, with your siblings.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.680]   Families get together with uncles and aunts and grandparents.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.360]   And so you have a lot of great memories of that when you're young.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.280]   But also some of your most painful memories also come from your childhood because maybe
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.080]   your parents didn't have the godliest marriage.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.880]   Or maybe, you know, a lot of you came from broken families.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.520]   And even if they didn't, weren't broken, they didn't have the healthiest, godliest of marriages.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.120]   So you have very painful memories from that.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   And this is obviously, this is not unique to the church, people who are in the church.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.200]   We live in a generation where supposedly more than 60% of marriages end in divorce.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.120]   So there's a lot of pain that people are living through and baggages that they have.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.900]   And so part of the reason why there's the counseling, psychological counseling has kind
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.320]   of taken off is because so many people are in pain and as a result of that.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.200]   They did a study and they said that 50% of people believe that marriage isn't that important
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.240]   to the health of society.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.520]   50%.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.800]   Two-thirds of people who are in the age of 19 to 29 believe it's not even necessary.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.840]   Since it causes so much pain, why do we even need to do that?
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.200]   Only 36% of the people believe that marriage is even necessary.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.680]   So more and more people in our generation are coming to their own conclusion that if
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.460]   it's going to cause this much pain, why have it?
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.840]   And you see celebrities coming out and openly saying that it is a dead institution.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.100]   It is a construct of society that no longer works.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.300]   So equal habit, if it doesn't work, move on, find somebody else.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.680]   And that's kind of like the culture that has been readily accepted.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:04.760]   There is nothing to me that is as clearly, that causes the church to be separated and
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.720]   defined and different than the biblical teaching of marriage and sexuality.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.380]   If there's any one thing that the world will look at and say, "Wow, those people are weird."
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.560]   At least in our generation, it's this human sexuality and the biblical definition of what
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.280]   a marriage ought to be.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.860]   Especially now.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.240]   If you haven't noticed it, I'm pretty sure it is coming.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.040]   That because if we are to remain faithful to what the Bible says, what marriage is and
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:48.280]   what human sexuality ought to be, that persecution is already here and it's only going to intensify.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.800]   Because this one thing is going to separate us clearly in the eyes of the world.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.680]   And all the more why we need to make sure that what the scripture says, that we do not
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.960]   compromise, no matter what consequences may come.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.600]   We're not here to appease the world.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.040]   We're not here to make sure that the people in the world feel comfortable here.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.560]   We're here to exalt Christ.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.240]   And so we need to make sure that what Christ says is what is being taught in scripture,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.380]   in the church.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.480]   So this morning, there's two parts of this sermon.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.520]   The first part is, it says in verse 4, it says, "Marriage is to be held in honor among
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   all."
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   What does that mean?
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.460]   What does it mean to honor marriage and why is this so important?
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.620]   And then secondly, it says, "Marriage bed is to be undefiled.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.280]   For fornicators and adulterers God will judge."
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.840]   What is the application of that?
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.760]   Practically, how do we honor marriage in a practical way?
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.220]   So first of all, marriage is to be held in honor among all.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.720]   So let me start off by saying, among all, it's not just talking about those who are
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.560]   married, those who are of age.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.520]   Among all includes everybody, young and old.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.800]   That you and I need to understand that all human relationships stem from the marriage
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.860]   between husband and wife.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.480]   So there is no relationship between father and son or daughter, brother, sister, grandparents,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   uncle.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.940]   All human relationship started by the relationship between Adam and Eve.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.400]   So if the relationship between Adam and Eve is not honored, everything else that comes
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.020]   from that is also going to be distorted.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.160]   You cannot fix the human relationship until we fix the relationship between husband and
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   wife.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.040]   And so when it says to honor marriage by all, this is not just for those people who are
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.040]   married.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.120]   This is something that married or not, young and old, single or not, that we need to recognize
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.320]   what the scripture teaches about this subject.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.080]   The word for honor is the same word it describes the precious stone in 1 Corinthians 3.12.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.120]   In 1 Peter 1.19, that word for honor is translated precious as the blood of Christ.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.800]   2 Peter 1.4, it says the promises of God is also precious and to be honored.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.140]   It means that we recognize the value of what this is.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.840]   Why is this so precious?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.400]   Why is that word that describes the blood of Christ, the church of Christ, the promise
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.320]   of God, and that we ought to honor the marriage in that light?
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.800]   First of all, the Bible makes it very clear.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.360]   Marriage is not a social construct.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.960]   It was created by God.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   Okay, let me say that again.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.040]   Marriage is not a social contract that we are to say, "It doesn't work because it's
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.880]   broken that we're not going to do this anymore."
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.060]   It was God ordained.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.400]   When was it ordained?
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.960]   From the get-go.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.000]   In Matthew 19, 3-6, there's some Pharisees came to Jesus testing him and asking, "Is
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.640]   it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.760]   And he answered and said, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.400]   made them male and female?"
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.720]   From the beginning.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.360]   It wasn't hundreds of years later.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.000]   It wasn't thousands of years later.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.800]   He said, "From the beginning when he created them male and female, he said, 'For this
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.840]   reason man shall leave his father and mother to be joined to his wife, and the two shall
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.960]   become one flesh.'"
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.880]   So they are no longer two but one flesh.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.480]   "What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.520]   So in every wedding ceremony, you will hear at the declaration of your covenant union,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.560]   what God has put together, let no man separate.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.600]   The first reason why we honor marriage is God created this.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.920]   God ordained this from the beginning.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   From the get-go.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.440]   And every other human relationship.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.100]   He didn't create Adam and Eve and then uncles and then children and all at once.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.120]   He created man and female.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.480]   All of the relationships came from these two people, from this marriage.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.840]   Genesis 2, 18 says, "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.680]   I will make him a helper suitable for him.'"
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.520]   So this text specifically is the purpose of why he created Adam and the purpose of why
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.200]   he created Eve.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.000]   He created all other creation and then he ends up by saying, "It is good."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.880]   And then he creates Adam and he said, "It is not good for him to be alone."
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.280]   So we have to understand that when he says it is not good, he's not talking about morally
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.960]   not good.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.400]   The word good here can also be understood not complete.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.560]   God created him and it was not good because what God had ordained him to be is not complete.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.840]   Because God's call for Adam was to remember twofold.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.160]   To be fruitful and multiply, right?
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.120]   And then to subdue the land.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.320]   To be the ruler of the land.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.680]   Those are the two creation mandates.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.880]   But in order to do that, he had to create Eve.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.960]   And so he says, "I will make him a helper suitable for him."
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   Suitable.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.240]   You know, it's interesting the word suitable means someone who is opposite or corresponding.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   Someone who will compliment.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.000]   You know, it's interesting because just by observation, most people who end up being
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.280]   attracted to one another are usually opposites.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.240]   And I'm not saying that's 100%.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.680]   You may be sitting next to your husband and wife and my guess is 90% of you, your wife
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.960]   is a bit different.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.680]   So if you happen to be very quiet, your wife may be extra.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.800]   Maybe you're the extra and then your wife is a quiet one.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.080]   And I'm not saying that that's true of every relationship.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.800]   I'm saying just for the most part, when we say opposites attract, that probably describes
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   most people.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.000]   Not 100%, nothing is ever 100%.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.680]   What's interesting is the way he describes Eve is that she would be the corresponding
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.360]   partner, a compliment, not a supplement, not the same person, but somebody who's going
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.440]   to compliment.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.400]   And so he made Eve to be a compliment, even physically, so that they would physically
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.800]   fit each other.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.640]   So that what he cannot do, that he needs her to be able to do that, both physically and
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.640]   spiritually.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.820]   But here's the problem.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.580]   That was God's ordination.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:19.200]   He created Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, needed Eve to do that, and to subdue
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   the land.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.040]   And so it was, if you look, before the fall, they're laboring together, they're naming
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.240]   animals, and they're working.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.760]   But you know what happens.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.280]   Sin comes in, they rebel against God, and the first thing that happens is Genesis 3:7,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.640]   "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked."
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.760]   Right?
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.480]   Now, even if you're naked, it doesn't bother you if you're by yourself, right?
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   Why were they hiding?
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.760]   "And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin covering."
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.600]   So who were they covering themselves to hide their nakedness from?
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   Each other.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.200]   It wasn't like, "Ew, disgusting."
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.840]   There's no mirrors back then.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.580]   They recognized their nakedness, and they hid from each other.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:12.360]   So from the get-go, there was shame, and so this husband and wife relationship, they hid
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   from each other.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.160]   See, one of the most key things that we cover in marriage counseling is biblical communication,
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.080]   because nobody is completely, 100% honest.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.720]   And it shows in the way that we communicate, because before I say anything to you, I calculate
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.840]   in my head, "If I say this, what are you going to think?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   How will you respond?
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.440]   What will you think of me if you say this?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.760]   Or maybe you said something that hurt me, so now I'm going to say this to hurt you."
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.080]   So everything that comes out of my mouth comes through some kind of filter.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.800]   So nobody is ever completely honest, and where this first comes in is a relationship between
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   husband and wife.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   That's what it says.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.380]   They hid from each other.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.160]   So from the get-go, the marriage relationship was tainted.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.460]   Genesis chapter 3, 16.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.380]   He says, "Because of the sin, the curse on Eve was, 'I will greatly multiply your pain
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.380]   in childbirth.'"
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:17.200]   Remember, this was the reason why Eve was created, so that she could be a suitable helper,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.300]   so that they can be fruitful and multiply.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.160]   But here it says, "You will be fruitful and multiply, but it will be painful."
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.400]   And pain and childbearing is not just referring to the actual birth itself.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.660]   It's talking about the whole process of giving birth, raising children.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.940]   And again, those of you who've raised children, you know, right, the hardest thing that you
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.760]   do in life is to raise a sinner, right?
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:49.060]   And we pray for salvation because it's really for our own benefit.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.420]   Because it's hard raising a sinner, right?
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.260]   Even after they're saved.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.420]   In pain, you will bring forth children, and then yet your desire will be for your husband,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.940]   and he will rule over you.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940]   You notice that?
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.940]   She was there.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.660]   She was created to be a suitable helper, to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.260]   She was there to help him, but instead, there's contention in this relationship.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.820]   Desire will be for your husband.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:16.340]   And the word "desire" here is a kind of word where she's trying to challenge him, and he
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.900]   says, "But he's going to rule over you."
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.620]   Instead of being a complement, they became the adversary because of sin.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.540]   So she's still carrying out the creation mandate, but as soon as sin comes in, the
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.540]   very thing that they call them to do, it becomes contentious in the home.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.100]   Genesis 3, 17 to 19, "Cursed is the ground because of you," and this is the curse to
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.380]   Adam, "in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life."
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.420]   Remember, he was called, he was created to take care of the land.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.340]   He said, "You're going to take care of it, but you will eat of it in toil.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.140]   Both thorns and thistles, it shall grow for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.940]   By the sweat of your face, you will eat bread."
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.820]   The curse of the fall is not our job, because God gave him a job before that sin came in.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.460]   What happened was, your job became painful, and it produced thorns and thistles, "Till
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.180]   you return to the ground, because from it you are taken, for you are dust, and to dust
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.740]   you shall return."
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.060]   What God created was good.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.700]   Sin came in and tainted everything, and it started with the relationship between husband
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.420]   and wife.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.740]   There's a reason why in our generation, in order to attack the work of God, the first
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.780]   place where it attacks is the family.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.820]   Because if the family falls apart, then the relationship with husband and wife, then the
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.180]   children fall apart, and if that falls apart, then the relationship between siblings fall
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.740]   apart, and if that falls apart, then all the other relationships that hinges on this relationship
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.080]   also begins to unravel.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:59.940]   But when he says to honor the marriage bed, and to honor marriage itself, it really is
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:07.640]   at the core of the reversal of this curse, because curse first came in, in the marriage.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.280]   That's why in Ephesians chapter 5, 22-32, you know the passage where it says, "Wife,
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.800]   be subject to your own husband as to the Lord.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.120]   For the husband is the head of the wife, and as Christ also is the head of the church,
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.520]   he himself being the savior of the body."
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.800]   And he says, "Submit to your husband as a church does to Christ."
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.280]   And then in 25-28, it says to the husbands to love them sacrificially, as Christ gave
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.400]   himself for the church.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.040]   When he says gave himself, he's not simply saying he prioritized her, he's saying he
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.280]   died.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.640]   And so what he's calling the husband to do is to sacrifice who he is for the sake of
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.120]   his wife.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.200]   You'll hear this, sermons about this at weddings, you know, and anniversaries, because it's
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.040]   a beautiful passage about the biblical mandate of marriage.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.080]   But here's how he sums it up in verse 31, "For this reason a man shall leave his father
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.440]   and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.960]   But this mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church."
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.720]   So he says that this illustration is that Christ and what he did for the church is not
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.800]   to uphold the marriage, but the marriage is to uphold the gospel.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:26.320]   Because where the curse came in and the ramification of the curse came in between husband and wife,
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.640]   the reversal of the curse is going to also begin at husband and wife.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:38.600]   And that's the reason why one of the qualifications of elders that's repeated in every list is
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.460]   that he needs to be able to manage household well.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.120]   That this man needs to, there needs to be evidence that there is regeneration in his
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.660]   life first at home between husband and wife and with their children.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:58.800]   So that once there is evidence of genuine salvation, reconciliation with God at home,
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.680]   then that man could be a leader at church.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.840]   So the proving ground where regeneration, reconciliation happens first is at home.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.660]   Is he a leader at home?
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:14.000]   And if so, then can he lead at church?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.720]   Marriage is the epicenter of the enemy's attack.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.300]   It has always been, but especially now.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.600]   Marriage is where the greatest sanctification takes place.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.040]   Now before you're married, you can kind of stiff-arm some people.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.520]   I mean, you shouldn't do that, but everybody practices that person.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520]   I like him.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   We're going to be acquaintances.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.720]   We're going to be best friends.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.440]   You're the person I'm going to tolerate.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.240]   And so there's a lot of sinfulness in us and selfishness in us that we kind of pick
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.580]   and choose who we're comfortable with.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.040]   When you get married, right, and you say, "Well, you know, we got to know our wife
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   and we got to know our husband."
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.080]   Yes, that's true.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.480]   But every, no matter how well you know your husband and wife, there are hidden sins in
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.000]   everybody that you're not going to see until you get married.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.600]   There's selfishness that we hide.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.380]   Of course we hide it, right?
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.840]   You know, we come out, when we go date, I mean, if that guy comes out with, you know,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.560]   ripped jeans and he just doesn't care, like, right off the bat, don't give him a chance,
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   right?
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.040]   This was not important to him, right?
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.480]   At first date, if he doesn't put out his best foot, he doesn't put his best shirt and best
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   pants and come out, already that tells you something.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.920]   Just, "Eh," move on, right?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.100]   But we do the same thing when we first get married because we want to give our best.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.960]   And so, you know, if you have a bad temper, you hold it.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.840]   If you're selfish, you know, you're very generous, right?
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.880]   Sooner or later, our fallen nature is going to be exposed.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.520]   But when you're married, a married couple, man, you can't go anywhere, right?
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.080]   When you're dating, like, you get mad and you go to your corner and you cool off after,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.760]   you know, maybe a few days and then now you're back to your, the person that you want to
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.280]   present and you bring them back, but when you're married, you don't have that opportunity.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:16.560]   So God uses that to sanctify us because as they, as you see their sins, your sins are
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.000]   going to be exposed, right?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.960]   Our sins get exposed by other people's sin.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.160]   So when you see their sins, you're going to respond in a sinful way.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.660]   And then when your sin gets exposed, like, we are to be sanctified.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.320]   And so marriage is a place because the most intimate relationship we have that we cannot
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   hide from one another, God uses that to sanctify us.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.240]   So it is the greatest place of sanctification.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.620]   Marriage is where the greatest practice of agape love is to be practiced.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.360]   There's a reason why he says to love your neighbor because neighbor is the person closest
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   to you.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.640]   And there's nobody closest to us than our husband and wives.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.960]   And so we are to practice that unconditional sacrificial love even when they don't deserve
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.440]   it, especially when they don't deserve it.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.400]   We are to practice the love that he practiced in us.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.860]   So where the rubber meets the road in the practice of this love is in marriage.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.460]   It is the proving ground for leadership in the church, which I've already mentioned.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.680]   And then fourthly, it is where the future generation comes from.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.840]   So if you want to attack the church and you want to make sure that it ends in this generation,
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.480]   ruin the family.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.740]   And then the next generation, it would be it.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:38.400]   So there's a reason why our enemy who prowls around like a roaring lion, when he is wanting
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.320]   to attack, where he's going to attack first is the home between husband and wife.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:50.520]   And so if you bring defilement into that, all the other relationships are going to unravel.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   And so this is why this is so important.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:59.160]   And this is why I'm taking this morning to cover this issue because we need to recognize
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.360]   what we're up against.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.160]   We need to make sure that our idea of what is right and wrong, what is good and bad,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.520]   is not coming from the culture.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.800]   That is coming from, it's not coming from what is popular in our generation.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.220]   First of all, how do we do this?
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.580]   He says by keeping the marriage bed undefiled.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.820]   And he's talking about sexual purity.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.780]   Undefiled.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.060]   You know, the term sex has become a dirty word, right?
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:37.220]   So if I say sex, my guess is automatically there's a little bit of discomfort.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.220]   Sex.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.860]   Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.220]   Just in case nobody heard it.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.220]   Sex.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.220]   Sex.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.220]   Anybody sleeping?
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.220]   Sex.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.740]   Okay, so.
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.740]   This is good for him.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.740]   Let him pay attention.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:08.420]   You know, first service, we had small children all over the place and parents were squirming.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.660]   But the term sex in and of itself is not a dirty word.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.740]   It's not a dirty word.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.060]   God gifted that to Adam and Eve.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.980]   He said to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.980]   He created Eve.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.020]   And so how were they going to obey this biblical mandate?
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.920]   Through sex between husband and wife.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.100]   But the reason why the term makes us feel uncomfortable is because almost everyone in
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.820]   this room, when we think of sex, we think of the perversion that is outside of what
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.820]   God intended.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.980]   Let me give you an example.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.820]   I got water here.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.820]   Drinking water.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.820]   I'm thirsty.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.820]   I'm thirsty.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.780]   Now, you can't live without water.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.620]   And I got some dirt.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.540]   And I got this from this plant underneath here.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.820]   In and of itself, it's great.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.340]   In fact, you need, in order for this plant to survive, it needs the dirt that God created
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:11.060]   and it needs the water that God created.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.940]   That was, I was just thirsty.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.820]   In and of itself, it needs it.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.180]   And if I pour both of it into the pot, what does it do?
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.580]   It causes the plant to grow.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.380]   It produces life.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:29.820]   But the moment that I take it out of its ordained place and I pour it in here, I can't drink
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.620]   it anymore.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.580]   It's useless.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.220]   The problem is not sex.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.820]   God created sex to produce life.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.940]   Then it is practiced in the ordained manner that God has given as a gift to husband and
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   wife.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.900]   But when you take it out of the context, it is useless.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:56.460]   Now I can't drink it.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:05.260]   Because sex was for the purpose, again, and there's a reason why God made it enjoyable.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.260]   It's not dirty.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:15.140]   He made it so that you would enjoy it in obeying God's creation mandate.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:23.660]   But the problem is that we've all been introduced to the defiled idea of sex in this world.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.380]   And so what ends up happening is when we think of sex, we're not thinking about the biblical
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.380]   gift of sex.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.660]   We're thinking about the perversion that you and I all have been introduced to.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:42.180]   Francis Schaeffer says that people drift along from generation to generation and the morally
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.700]   unthinkable becomes unthinkable as the years move on.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.260]   Let me say that again.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.060]   People drift along from generation to generation and the morally unthinkable becomes thinkable
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.900]   as the years move on.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:58.380]   Some of you who are younger may not have the benefit of knowing what it was like 30 years
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.700]   ago or 40 years ago.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:05.260]   But those of you who are a bit older, you know exactly what he means by that.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:12.220]   What was unthinkable, even in the non-Christian world, has become not only thinkable but openly
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.180]   practiced.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.260]   And sad to say it is starting to penetrate even inside the church.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:25.300]   What is unthinkable has become thinkable and actually is being practiced.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.100]   You know what's interesting is here the word fornicator, and then there's another word
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.420]   for adultery, says they will be judged.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:36.780]   And the specific nuance of this word fornicator is pornos, where we get the word pornography.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.860]   And that word basically means to sell, to sell cheaply.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.480]   And so that word was used specifically for male prostitutes.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.540]   But the idea of this word is to take something that is valuable and cheapen it.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:56.260]   That you see certain shows, you know, antique road show, and then you'll see somebody who
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.700]   picked up this painting for $15 and then they go and get it, you know, assessed and they
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.660]   say, "Oh, this was from Monet that they lost so many years ago and it's worth $15 million."
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:13.260]   But he found it at a garage sale because owner had no idea of its value.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.740]   That's that word, pornos.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:23.060]   Is to take something that is so valuable and to cheapen it because we don't understand
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.060]   the value of what it is that God has given us.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:32.020]   The word adultery basically means to live by your flesh, just to give into your impulse,
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.820]   to instinct.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:42.380]   You know, we could think, humanly speaking, when we commit sexual offences, it doesn't
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   hurt anybody.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.620]   When we slander people, we hurt them.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.900]   When we steal, when we, you know, when we do these things, we actually hurt people.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.900]   But you know, if we are impure and we're hooked on pornography, watch things that we shouldn't
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:00.780]   watch, right, it doesn't hurt anybody because it's just me being, doing it privately.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.380]   But here's what it says.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.820]   In 1 Corinthians 6, 18 to 20, it says, "Flee immorality.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.620]   Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.020]   his own body."
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.820]   I've said this before.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:22.420]   It is ridiculous that some people of prominence are saying that God screams social justice,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.420]   but he whispers sexual immorality.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.420]   Look at what he says.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.500]   "All other sins commits outside of the body."
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.420]   He is separating the sexual immorality with all other sins.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.860]   But the immoral man sins against his own body.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.860]   So the scripture screams sexual immorality.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.420]   Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.660]   Look at the scripture.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.360]   Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.540]   have from God, and that you are not your own, for you have been bought with a price, therefore
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.260]   glorify God in your body.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.300]   What is the most precious thing in this building?
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   Guitar?
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   The synthesizer?
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   Is that an outdated term?
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   Keyboard?
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   The drums?
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.460]   Our A/B system?
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.780]   What's the most precious thing in this building?
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.420]   It's you.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.420]   It's me.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   Because the Bible says that we have been purchased by the blood of Christ.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.540]   That may cost two, three thousand dollars.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   I don't know how much it costs.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.940]   The drum, a couple thousand dollars.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.980]   Maybe ten, fifteen thousand dollars for the A/B system.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.780]   But every child of God was purchased by the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.420]   The Son of God had to come and give himself to purchase us.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.100]   And the Bible says that we no longer belong to ourself.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.100]   This is his.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:50.220]   So when we think that we're not hurting anybody, the greatest crime, the greatest sin, is to
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.580]   defile what God had declared to be holy.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   He didn't just say we were holy.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:03.020]   He died on the cross and shed his blood, absorbed our sins to make us holy.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:09.940]   So to think that somehow the sexual sin only bothers us is because we don't understand
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.840]   what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.180]   To keep this marriage bed undefiled begins before we get married.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.180]   Even after we get married.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.140]   What we do even by ourselves.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.180]   Saving ourselves for marriage.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.780]   You know what's interesting about this word marriage?
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.980]   It's not just in reference to people who are married.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.820]   The marriage of institution.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.380]   The specific nuance of this word is the marriage ceremony.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.020]   It's the day that you get married.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.660]   He's saying that do not defile the marriage ceremony.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:51.140]   Meaning, when you come together, that you come together prepared, undefiled.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:58.420]   The way that dating happens in our generation is completely pagan.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.380]   Let me say this again.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:06.180]   If you follow the pattern of this world, and you date like everybody else dates in our
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.740]   generation, it is completely pagan.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.100]   We're Bereans because we want to examine the word of God that everything that we do,
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.060]   that we're following what the scripture tells us to do.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:27.340]   When it comes to this, we have a tendency to have no intention to buy the car, but you're
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.300]   in the car, you're decorating the car, you're cleaning the car, you're investing, change
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.020]   the tires, and they say, "Are you going to buy the car?"
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.700]   I said, "No, not yet."
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.340]   So you start the engine, you put it on drive, and then you put one foot on the brake, and
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.500]   then the other foot revving it up as hard as you can.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.500]   Are you going to drive the car?
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.060]   I said, "No, not yet."
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.980]   And that's kind of how we date.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.340]   We act like we're married, and then when we get physically intimate, it's like, "Oh, we
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.340]   made a mistake."
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.460]   But everything that you did led to that.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.020]   It says in Psalm 8, 4, "I want you to swear, O daughter of Jerusalem, do not arouse or
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   waken my love until she pleases."
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.220]   What he means by that is not to arouse.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.380]   Don't do things to arouse this passion until it's time.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.380]   What's the time he's referring to?
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.080]   Marriage.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.580]   So that night, when the husband and wife comes together, it was meant for that.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.020]   He says, "Do not defile the marriage bed.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.500]   Keep it holy, undefiled, until God ordains it."
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.540]   So when two people come together for the purpose of marrying, we're not there to celebrate
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.380]   the love of these two people, even though that's what brought them there.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:42.860]   Ultimately, we come to the Christian wedding, is coming to the altar and asking God to bless
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.940]   this covenant.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:50.540]   That's why every once in a while, it's like, "I'll go to Vegas and let Elvis Presley ordain
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   our marriage."
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.300]   It's like, you could do that legally and the world would acknowledge you, but that's not
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.300]   a Christian wedding.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   You can go to a courtroom and then the courtroom, some clerk just signs the paper off and says,
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.500]   "Yes, legally in the world, you're married."
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.980]   But that's not a Christian marriage.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.020]   Christian marriage is coming before the Lord and asking the Lord to bless this covenant.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:18.580]   And so when a pastor says, "Whatever God has put together, let no man separate."
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:26.780]   So if we want God's ordination, we don't come with a paper that the world signs and say,
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.180]   "Hey, the world says I'm married, so I need you to acknowledge this."
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.380]   No, every time two Christians come together at the altar, that's where the wedding takes
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.380]   place.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.140]   That's where the union takes place.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:43.780]   And so he's saying, "Do not arouse or awaken my love until she pleases."
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:53.260]   And I want to read this song from this great theologian, Beyonce, of our generation.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.700]   Put a ring on it.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:03.820]   I didn't realize that this was a song for sacredness of marriage until I read the lyrics.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:08.620]   You guys all seen the dances on YouTube and stuff, but here are the lyrics.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.260]   All the single ladies.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.260]   I'm not going to sing it.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.340]   I'm not going to ruin the whole message because of this.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.820]   All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.780]   Now put your hands up.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.380]   Up in the club, we just broke up.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.260]   I'm doing my own thing.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:31.540]   Decided to dip, and now you want to trip because another brother noticed me.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.180]   I'm up on him.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.080]   He up on me.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.340]   Don't pay him any attention.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.660]   Just cried my tears for three good years.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.460]   You can't be mad at me.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.900]   Because if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.100]   If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.960]   Don't be mad once you see that he want it.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.980]   If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.780]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:06.680]   There's two parts, two deep theological truths in this song.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:17.440]   One is, if you wanted her, you should have put a ring on it.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:23.660]   If you want to possess her, if you want to have her, marry her, that's what he's saying.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.120]   That's what she's saying.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.920]   So sacredness of marriage.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:34.880]   The other side of it is, if you've already given yourself to him, why does he need to
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.540]   put a ring on it?
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.960]   If everything that was reserved for marriage was given to him outside of marriage, why
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.040]   does he need to get married then?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.480]   So this song really is about the sanctity of marriage.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   Because that's what marriage was created for.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:59.360]   When it says, "Do not arouse until it is time," meaning that we ought to stay pure until we
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.960]   are married.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:08.860]   Thirdly, we need to uphold the marriage, honor the marriage by upholding biblical marriage
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.720]   between man and woman.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:21.140]   You know, it's disturbing because 30-some years ago when I started preaching, I would
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.840]   go to a church, and it doesn't matter what church I am, I could talk about homosexuality
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.800]   being against the scripture, and I would almost get no response.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.320]   Of course.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.000]   Even at school.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.600]   Even at a secular setting.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.340]   I would rarely get any kind of pushback.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.780]   Now sometimes, even when I'm at a Bible church, I would say something like this, and somebody
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.240]   would come up to me and say, "How can you possibly say this?"
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.380]   Let me make this absolutely crystal clear.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.840]   The Bible is not ambiguous about the subject.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.160]   It is not ambiguous about the subject.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.980]   Genesis 127, it says, "God created man in His own image.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.840]   In the image of God, He created him.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   Male and female, He created them."
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:12.080]   More and more people in our culture are saying, "Male doesn't mean male.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.120]   Female doesn't mean female."
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.920]   And so more and more people who are sympathetic, I understand.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.440]   And I know that you have people in this room, you could be struggling, maybe with same-sex
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.680]   attraction, maybe you have brother or sister or cousin or somebody that you know, you're
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.720]   really struggling with this, and because of your sympathetic heart, you want this not
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.840]   to be true.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.360]   I understand your heart.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.120]   You cannot compromise what the Word of God clearly says.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:50.520]   The Bible has not been written so that you need to go to school and you need to learn
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:56.480]   deep theology and then to come out and say, "Male doesn't mean male."
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.200]   And "female doesn't mean female."
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:06.640]   The Bible was written so that a child who reads it comes out and says, "Male and female."
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.600]   And more and more people are coming out and saying, "No, no, no.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.200]   Gender cannot be identified by human parts.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.120]   It's happening what's inside."
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.320]   So male isn't male, female isn't female.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.880]   Leviticus 18.22 says, "You should not lie with a male as one lies with a female.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.080]   It is an abomination."
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.920]   It is an abomination because it challenges God's purpose in creation.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.680]   The very reason why you and I were created is to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.400]   So if Satan's going to attack, he attacks that.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.880]   Once you attack that, you cannot obey the biblical mandate.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.520]   Romans chapter 1, 26-27, "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.840]   For their woman exchanged a natural function for what is unnatural.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.800]   And in the same way also men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.480]   their desire toward one another.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.760]   Men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.120]   of their error."
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:12.000]   This push to erase gender identity is not new.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:21.920]   From the beginning, when Satan decided to challenge God, he began to attack the marriage.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.260]   What's happening now is not new.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.740]   It just happens to be more prominent and because we have media, it's being spoken of and there's
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:34.600]   pressure coming and for sure persecution is coming because of this.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   Bible is not ambiguous.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:42.260]   1 Corinthians 6, 9-10, "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.260]   of God?
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.260]   Do not be deceived.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:49.920]   Neither fornicators, adulterers, nor idolaters, adulterers, nor effeminate are homosexuals."
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:58.200]   You know the word effeminate basically means a man who acts like a female.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.840]   Basically it's referring to male prostitutes.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.360]   But an individual who has feminized himself to act like a female.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.240]   That's what that specific understanding of that word means.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.200]   Nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkard, nor revilers, nor swindlers
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.260]   will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.720]   The Bible is clear.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:25.560]   So I ask you, and some of you may have been challenged by your friends and said, "That's
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.600]   not what the Bible says."
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.920]   And so I encourage you to be Bereans.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.600]   If what I say disturbs you, don't say, "I don't like that guy."
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.040]   That guy, that guy's like this.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   Test the scriptures.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   Go to the Bible.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.340]   Look at the verses that are being quoted.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.900]   And look at it for yourself.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:52.640]   See if this is the prejudice of this guy or a few right-wing Christians or does the Bible
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.720]   actually teach this?
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:01.240]   I'm telling you emphatically, there is no ambiguity in this issue.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.560]   It is crystal clear.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:10.060]   Marriage, fourthly, must be between two believers.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.200]   In 2 Corinthians 6, 14-16, "Do not be bound together with an unbeliever, for what partnership
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.180]   have righteousness and lawlessness?
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.360]   What fellowship has light with darkness?
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.520]   Or what harmony has Christ with Belial?
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.740]   Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.640]   What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, 'I will dwell in them and walk
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.360]   among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.'"
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:43.920]   Evangelism, mission marriage or mission dating is not biblical.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.280]   Again, the Bible's clear on that.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:53.720]   How can one person who believes that his whole hope rests upon Christ and his sacrifice and
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.480]   an individual who doesn't even believe in God raise children together?
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.520]   They cannot.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.760]   Either the person has completely compromised their faith or they probably don't believe
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.820]   at all.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.160]   But the Bible is crystal clear on this subject.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.720]   A biblical marriage is between two believers.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:22.760]   Fifthly, marriage covenant is never to be broken outside of what God permits.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.040]   And again, at the end of the marriage, we say, "What God has put together, let no man
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   separate."
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.560]   In Malachi 2.16, it says, "For I hate divorce," says the Lord, the God of Israel.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.720]   And him who covers his garments with wrongs, says the Lord of hosts, "So take heed to your
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.080]   spirit that you do not deal treacherously."
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.680]   I hate divorce.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.040]   I mean, there's no ambiguity there.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.560]   God makes that absolutely crystal clear.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.480]   In Matthew 19.9, it says, "And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife except for immorality
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.700]   and marries another woman commits adultery."
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:01.280]   Because God has ordained it, man does not stand before God and say, "No, I'm not going
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   to take this seriously."
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:07.520]   So everyone who comes into the covenant relationship, it's meant to be permanent.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:15.880]   Now, the scripture does give guidance that if you have married an unbeliever, to not
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   to divorce.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.760]   They use it as an opportunity to share the gospel with them.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:29.360]   But if, again, when the two believers come together, that they are never to separate,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   that we are to be sanctified, to grow and mature in that context.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:42.560]   And then, finally, marriage is to be honored by establishing biblical role of the husband
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.880]   and wife.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:50.560]   I would say in the church, I get the greatest pushback from this.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.800]   That men are to lead and the women are to follow.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.720]   I'm trying to see who's bothered by this.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.960]   I get greater pushback on this than probably any other subject because this is where the
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.120]   rubber meets the road.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.880]   But let me make this clear.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.600]   We don't choose what's right and wrong based upon what is acceptable, what seems reasonable
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   to us.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.040]   We are, first and foremost, we have to be brilliant.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.080]   What does the Bible say?
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:29.200]   Bible clearly says that men were given the task to lead.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.400]   And that's why he tells women to submit.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.120]   But let me say this to the men.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.880]   You have to be men first.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.520]   You have to be men first.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:51.200]   If you live your life like a child, you act like a child, you talk like a child, you behave
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:58.240]   like a child, and then you ask your wife to submit to you.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.000]   No wonder they don't want to come.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.600]   If you have a commanding officer whose sole purpose is to glorify himself, and he's acting
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:15.040]   selfishly, and he's asking you to submit so that he can have a better life, who's going
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.880]   to follow this guy?
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   So when a man stands up and is a man, and this is, again, the challenge in our culture.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.920]   If you say you're a man, automatically it's toxic.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.840]   So the lines are being blurred where men have to act like women and women have to act like
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.440]   men.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.880]   Completely unbiblical.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.720]   Men have to first act like men.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.640]   Now I'm not telling you specifically what that means, but let me get to something that
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.360]   I think is going to, if you haven't been bothered up to this point, it's going to be bothered
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.560]   now.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:03.040]   If you're a guy who has habits that is causing your wife to be frustrated because you're
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:08.920]   playing games all day, and it's affecting your marriage, or maybe your spending habit,
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:14.280]   or whatever it is you're doing, your living self-centered lives, you're not acting like
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.760]   men.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.120]   Because God called us to lead.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   He called us to lead.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:28.600]   So when we tell or ask our wives to follow us and support us and submit to us, they need
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:36.760]   to know that if they follow us, that we're going to lead them to Christ.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.320]   That they need to have confidence that if they submit to us, that we're looking out
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.200]   for their best interest.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:50.840]   That if they honor us, that they are following men who have committed themselves to pick
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.880]   up their cross and lead them to the cross as well.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.040]   But if they are not confident that that's what you are doing, that's where you're headed,
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.840]   and then you say, "Submit."
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.040]   Who's going to submit to that?
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:12.840]   If she's not certain that that's where you're headed, if she questions your selfishness,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:19.480]   then even though the Bible mandates this, you've shot yourself in the foot.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.640]   And then you say, "Let's go."
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:29.080]   In order for marriage to be honored, men need to learn what it means to be men.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.600]   To lead.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.480]   To sacrifice.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.280]   To put away childish things.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.840]   I'm not saying that you can't play games.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.400]   I'm not saying that you can't have hobbies.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:47.720]   But if those things impede you being men in your home, before you shake the Bible and
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.960]   tell them, "Oh, wives are supposed to do this.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.320]   Wives are supposed to do that."
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.400]   Before that happens, we need to take a long, hard look at ourselves.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:00.640]   Am I somebody that she can respect?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:10.320]   So until men are first men, we cannot establish honor in the marriage.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:17.120]   Having said that, women need to submit.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.880]   What an outdated thing to say in this generation.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   And this is going to be reported.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.800]   There are some people who are watching this.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   I don't know who's watching this.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.920]   I'm sure somebody's going to be offended.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.920]   What I just said, I just quoted scripture.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   I remember the very first wedding that I was officiating, and the future wife had a problem
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   with that.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.280]   I said, "I don't want to say this word.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   It's not romantic."
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.080]   "The non-Christian guests who are coming are not going to understand.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.520]   So can you change that word?"
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.160]   And I thought long and hard for four seconds.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.200]   And I said, "No."
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.760]   Because I'm asking you to quote a Bible verse.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.300]   A Bible verse.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:16.600]   So if you cannot adhere to God's ordained mandate in scripture, you're not asking for
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.700]   the Lord's blessing.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.140]   You can sign a piece of paper.
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.060]   You can get Elvis to come and officiate.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.700]   But a minister of God in the right conscious cannot do that.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.900]   Because he no longer represents Christ.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.340]   He represents the culture.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:40.100]   He wants to appease you before he is obedient to God.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:49.740]   When a marriage is established where Christ is at the center, that's where true life is.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.740]   That's where true life is.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.380]   The reason why he told his disciples to pick up his cross and deny himself is because at
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:58.140]   the other side of the cross was the resurrected life.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.580]   So all that he has commanded in creation, all that he has commanded in this new generation
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.820]   is no different.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:09.060]   God calls us to submit to the word of God because the word of God, when we practice
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:15.420]   the way that God has given it to us, is the path of life.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.400]   Is where the children are raised, husband and wives are happy.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.380]   If you ask a husband and wife when something goes wrong, you know what they typically say?
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.500]   The wife usually complains that they don't feel loved.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.780]   And you know what the typical complaint of a husband is?
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.540]   I don't feel respected.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.540]   Why do you think they say that?
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:38.940]   It's not because they looked long and hard into the scripture and said, "Oh, they're
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.620]   supposed to respect me and honor me."
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.620]   No.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.820]   Innately, that's how God has created us.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:49.340]   For ladies to be loved and men to be respected so you can lead.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.700]   It's embedded into creation.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:59.140]   So when we give ourselves an obedience to that, we experience what God intended in creation.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:05.700]   So we benefit, our children benefit, and our church benefits.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:10.180]   Let me wrap it up in this.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:16.580]   Having said everything I've said, I'm pretty sure I've said enough to offend all of you.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.300]   I'm pretty sure I've covered enough where there's not a single person, including myself,
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:25.220]   that is not indicted by what has been said.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:29.780]   First and foremost, we must never compromise what the scripture says to appease the culture
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:34.300]   that we're in, no matter what the consequence.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.220]   No matter what the consequence.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:40.020]   Because it is not safe to disobey God.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.840]   It is not safe because the place where I find refuge is in Christ.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.620]   My refuge is not in this world.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:51.400]   My refuge is not in the good reputation that I get from this world.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.700]   My reputation doesn't come from the size of this church.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.700]   That's not my refuge.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.140]   My refuge is found in Him.
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:02.300]   So whatever storms may come as a result of running to Him is the safest place for any
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.500]   Christian to be.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.820]   So we must never compromise the biblical truth.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:12.540]   But number two, all of us are indicted by what I said.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.300]   Every single one of us.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.860]   If you go to a secular psychologist, they'll tell you, "Hey, you know what?
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:21.580]   You're the way you are because your mom treated you this way or your dad treated you this
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.620]   way.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.700]   Because something happened to you when you were a little girl.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.380]   Something happened to you when you were a little boy."
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.220]   And so they'll identify and then they'll say, "You're the way you are because somebody did
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.220]   this to you."
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:37.620]   And so you can easily live your life and say, "I am the way I am because I've been sinned
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.020]   against.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.440]   And I sin against other people because I've been sinned against."
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.380]   If you're not a Christian, that may be a good justification.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.860]   No Christian stands before God and says, "I am the way I am because of what they've done
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.740]   to me."
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:02.520]   Every single person who has become new by the blood of Christ stands in the presence
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:09.540]   of His throne of grace and says, "I am what I am because of what Jesus did for me.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.060]   I do what I do because He loved me.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.940]   I am what I am despite all that happened in this fallen world.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:23.380]   I am what I am because of what He did to me."
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:29.940]   All the filth and dirtiness and the pain that you experienced that came from your family,
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:39.020]   from relationships, where the curse gets reversed is in Christ.
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:45.200]   So I can stand here and tell you the pain that I've had, the things that I've been wronged.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.380]   And I'm sure every single one of you to different degrees can say the same thing.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:54.740]   But the reason why you and I are here is not to share with each other how painful our past
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.020]   has been.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:02.000]   You and I are here together because Christ reversed this curse.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.940]   He reversed this curse so that we no longer live.
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.820]   He said, "I hurt you because they hurt me."
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.820]   No.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:15.000]   "I love because He loved me."
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.300]   And that curse gets reversed in the home first.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:25.560]   That's why marriage must be honored among all.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.400]   And this bed must not be defiled.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:37.420]   Let's pray.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:45.420]   As we ask our praise team to come, let's take some time to come before the Lord.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:53.820]   Whatever sins that we have committed, however deep we feel indicted because of the Word
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:58.600]   of God, our hope is in Christ.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.020]   You can't reverse this curse.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:04.340]   You can't reverse what's been done by being good.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:12.260]   The only power that can save us from our own sins is the power of the cross.
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:17.760]   So let's all come individually and collectively to refocus our attention on Christ, to be
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.980]   anchored in Him so that all that we do, all that we think will be led by the blood of
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   Christ.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.160]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:37.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
