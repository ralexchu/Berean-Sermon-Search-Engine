[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   We've been already announcing this several times, but for the family ministry retreat
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.920]   that's taking place really soon, if you have still yet to either pay the registration fee
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.040]   or whatnot, please be sure to take care of that.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.680]   If you have any questions, ask our brother Jason Choi.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.600]   I'd like to highlight a Basics in Christianity class.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.280]   So that's a class that we offer.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.880]   It's a 10-week course, so it's kind of lengthy, but it's an important class for any of you
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.860]   who are, let's say, newer to the faith.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.760]   It covers the foundational doctrines of the Christian faith, and so we'll cover theology,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.920]   but also it serves as our church's introduction to membership class.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.560]   And so it speaks a lot, or we cover a lot about why we do what we do.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.420]   So from those foundational doctrines, a rationale and philosophy for ministry.
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.240]   So I encourage you to sign up for that.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.780]   It begins September 4th on Sunday from 9.30 to 10.30, and you can either sign up by emailing
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.360]   me directly or, again, stop by the welcome table and they'll be happy to just sign you
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.360]   up for that.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   Okay?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.000]   Lastly, for our young adults, the post-grads, there is a date set for Beach Fellowship,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.620]   which is September 10th, so please mark your calendars and save the date for that.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.040]   More information and signups for that event will be posted on the Berean Facebook page
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.400]   or also on our website as well.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   Okay?
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   All right.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.480]   Well, please turn your Bibles over to Psalm chapter 31.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.080]   Okay, Psalm chapter 31.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.080]   And I'm going to be reading from verse one through five.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.000]   I wish that I had time to go over the entire chapter, but we'll focus our attention on
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520]   one through five and cover all the major themes in this chapter.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.080]   So it begins by saying, for the choir director, this is to be sung, a Psalm of David.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.040]   "In you, O Lord, I have taken refuge.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.840]   Let me never be ashamed.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.480]   In your righteousness, deliver me.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.000]   Incline your ear to me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Rescue me quickly.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.360]   Be to me a rock of strength, a stronghold to save me.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.960]   For you are my rock and my fortress.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.160]   For your name's sake, you will lead me and guide me.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440]   For you are my strength.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.920]   Into your hand I commit my spirit.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.880]   You have ransomed me, O Lord, God of truth."
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.360]   God, we thank you again this morning that truly you do not leave us on our own, for
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.160]   we would be utterly in ruin if we were by ourselves.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.360]   But God, we thank you that your grace pervades, that your love abides, and that your presence
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.960]   is always around us.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.400]   Father, I ask that by faith we would be cognizant of the fact that you are our hope and our
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   strong rock.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.000]   I ask, Lord, that you would encourage us with your words this morning and help us, Lord,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.400]   by having insight to ultimately be transformed as well.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.600]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Amen.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   Okay.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.680]   Well, I want to highlight to you an Olympic athlete, just because the Olympics are going
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.880]   on and we've been watching at home.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.060]   And I'm pretty sure you've heard of her and you've heard her name.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.960]   Her name is Yusra Mardini.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.600]   And her name is significant because she is one of 10 refugee athletes.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.760]   There is a team of athletes who are competing in the Olympics games who are refugees from
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   different countries.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.280]   Yusra happens to be a Syrian teenager, only 18 years old, and she is an Olympic swimmer.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.560]   And she has been competing and she made headlines when, in her heat, she was first place.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.240]   Unfortunately, now, obviously, as time has gone by, other athletes have gone forward,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.120]   but she came on the news with great attention.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.240]   And I caught my eye because I read on the highlights, Christian from Damascus.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   Okay.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.880]   And it's quite wild because I've been currently studying through the book of Acts with our
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.360]   youth group students.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.840]   And she happens to come from a Christian family who has fled Syria.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   Okay.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.960]   And the reason why it becomes, the story becomes even more amazing is because she tells of
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.280]   a story how while she was growing up, she was training for the Olympics under the Syrian
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.920]   nation, right, as represented for the Syrian nation.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.200]   And she was training with her sister and she was training with other people.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.520]   But living in a war torn, with such civil unrest, she said regularly there would be
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.200]   holes in the roof the next day she would come because of bombings, because of the violence
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.000]   that was happening.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.560]   And ultimately, they had to flee.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.280]   It was not like they had a choice.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.640]   They had to flee Syria because her home was absolutely destroyed.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   Okay.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.880]   And I can't imagine that.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.640]   But she tells of the story, her whole family then got into, the plan was they got into
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   a boat.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640]   Okay.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.040]   Syria, if you'd imagine that kind of like a Palestinian land, they're just north of
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.680]   Jerusalem area.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.920]   Okay.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.160]   And the plan was for their whole family to get onto a boat and then travel upwards towards
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   Europe.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   Okay.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.640]   Now the boat, this isn't like a ship.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   This isn't like a big boat.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.280]   It's a tiny raft with a motor on the back.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.000]   And supposedly it was made for eight people, but there was 18 or 20 people on this boat.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Okay.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.080]   So they're traveling and they travel to Lebanon, make a stop, they travel to Turkey, and then
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.480]   they're making their way towards Europe.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.920]   On their journey, the motor gives out.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   So what do they do?
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.960]   Some of the guys jump in, they start trying to swim and pull the boat.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.560]   They gas out so they get in, but they hear these Olympic swimmers, they get in the water.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.360]   They swim for three hours in the cold water, pushing this boat with people.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   Right.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   And then finally they make it to Germany.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.760]   When I read that, I was like, what in the world?
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   That's crazy.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.340]   But as you imagine that, can you imagine just picture that scene where these young girls
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.240]   are swimming in the water, cold, open water.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.920]   This isn't like your nice calm pool, but open waters, swimming for their lives, for the
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.360]   lives of the people on the boat.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   And then to finally reach ground.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.520]   What it feels like for your feet to touch the land.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.800]   Why do I say that?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.560]   It's because in the passage that we read, King David says, "In you, O Lord, I have taken
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.880]   refuge."
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.400]   It is like that woman finding finally the land that she's been going for.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.960]   The refugee has found refuge.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   King David was a refugee in some sense or another.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.040]   He was on the run.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.000]   And he has found his safety, his landing in God.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.720]   And for us this morning, I want to encourage you, this is a testimony from King David to
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   us.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.840]   And he's challenging the generations to come with song in this chapter to take refuge in
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.520]   God and to have hope in Him.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.760]   But see, here's a huge question is, I get it when somebody is swimming for, let's say,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.720]   the edge of the pool.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.960]   They're swimming for something like land, right?
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.240]   But how do you take refuge in a person?
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.640]   In God?
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.560]   You don't see Him, right?
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.400]   You don't audibly hear Him.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.960]   How do you take refuge in this God?
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.680]   And that's what we're going to be tackling today.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.840]   How we need to take refuge in the Lord.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.760]   But how do we do that?
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   How do we do that?
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.960]   Now, in order to begin, let's take a look at verse 1 through 3, our first section.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   Okay?
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.120]   Our first section.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.800]   And here David says again, "In you, O Lord, I have taken refuge."
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   That is his introductory summary statement.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000]   And then he makes his requests.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.600]   He says, "Let me never be ashamed.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.360]   In your righteousness, deliver me.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.160]   Incline your ear to me.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   Rescue me quickly.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.320]   Be to me a rock of strength, a stronghold to save me."
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   And this first section, I'd like to call, right, as our encouragement to take refuge
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.560]   in God, to request safety.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   Right?
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.280]   To request safety.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.480]   Essentially all King David is doing at this point, at the second half of verse 1, he's
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.920]   saying, "Please, guard me."
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   Right?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.080]   When he says, "Please never let me put to shame," he's not simply just talking about
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   his reputation.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.560]   As though he's overly concerned about, "Oh, how do people think of me?"
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   Right?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.880]   He's not ashamed as to be put down.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.480]   And he's desiring that kind of protection and preservation from God.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.880]   And then he asks that God would listen and that God would be to him that rock.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   And my question to you is, not simply, "Hey, you should ask God," but, "Have you been asking
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.800]   God?
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.240]   Have you been going to God with this kind of request?"
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.880]   I mean, I know that we regularly go to God with, "Give us our daily bread.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.000]   We pray for our meals."
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.200]   Many of you students pray for grades, pray for strength to study.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.400]   Many of us sometimes pray for things to go well with our work and families.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.600]   But have we cried out in this way?
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.840]   If you look, he makes a further petition.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   Okay?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   Further petition.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.840]   Give me a second here.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   Okay.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.920]   A further petition in verse 9 through 13.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:59.520]   He says this, "Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress."
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.080]   Now, we typically don't talk like that.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   It's like, "Oh."
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.520]   You don't come home after a hard day at work and like, "Honey, I'm so distressed."
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   You know?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   We use different terms, right?
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.480]   And typically it's things like, "Dude, I'm so wasted.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.840]   Like I've got no energy.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   I'm spent."
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.000]   And that's exactly what he's talking about.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.240]   Because look at the next words that he says.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.200]   "My eye is wasted away from grief.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.520]   My soul and my body also.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.520]   For my life is spent with sorrow and my ears with sighing.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.600]   My strength has failed because of my iniquity and my body has wasted away.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.920]   Because of all the adversaries, I have become a reproach, especially to my neighbors.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.640]   And an object of dread to my acquaintances.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.240]   Those who see me in the street flee from me.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.440]   I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.760]   I am like a broken vessel.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.120]   For I have heard the slander of many.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.640]   Terror is on every side.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.880]   While they took counsel together against me, they schemed to take away my life.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   Dang.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.680]   King David went through some hard times, huh?
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   He really did.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.360]   He really did.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   And you know, maybe some of us could relate to those words, but we know that King David
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.880]   has gone through life circumstances that are truly terror on every side.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.240]   Where he felt like his life was at risk.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.280]   And I believe that this chapter, it doesn't say specifically what circumstance of life
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   he was in, but I believe there is a specific historical occasion to which this testimony
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.840]   comes to us.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.280]   Please turn your Bibles over to 1 Samuel, okay?
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.440]   Please turn your Bibles over to 1 Samuel chapter 23.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.200]   And I believe this is a story to which King David is referring to.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.480]   There's so many corollaries and so many connections.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   Okay, 1 Samuel, okay, chapter 23.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.600]   And as you guys go there, I want to give you guys a little bit of context.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.880]   King David's really young, okay?
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.640]   So added to the idea that, wow, he must have been like anxious.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   He must have been stressed.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   Yes.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.840]   He's a young man, okay?
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:16.600]   Because only several chapters ago, okay, remember like David's the one who fought Goliath, but
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.440]   when he fought Goliath, he was a young little boy with a sling, right?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.700]   And then a few chapters later, when he's being anointed as king, they went through all the
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.000]   brothers and David was so young, everyone was like, "The what?"
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Right?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.200]   So my point being is, by context, David is really young.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.760]   He's pretty young right here.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.400]   And the scenario is King Saul has already been rejected by God.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.120]   Chapter 15, Saul sins against the Lord by taking position he's not supposed to, and
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.980]   Samuel said, "Saul, you've been rejected."
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.600]   And then King David has already been anointed and said, "This is the one who's going to
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   be king and will reign."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.080]   So Saul now, he's just in fit.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   He's just enraged.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.040]   He's in jealousy and he's trying to desperately hold on to the little authority that he has.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.600]   Well, actually he still has a lot of authority, but he's trying to hold on with dear life.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.960]   And he is willing, as you know the story, he is very willing to kill David.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.160]   As a matter of fact, he's not only willing, but he's on a manhunt.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   He's on a search and destroy mission to go kill this man.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   Okay?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.840]   And that's where we drop in in chapter 23.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.300]   What's happening is King David is speaking and praying to the Lord.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:30.560]   And because David is God's man, God is going to use David to fight other nations.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.760]   Who is he fighting in this moment?
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.400]   The Philistine nation.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.560]   They're big, they're powerful, they're armed.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   Okay?
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.960]   And what happens is in verse one through three, it says, "Then they told David saying, 'Behold,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.240]   the Philistines are fighting against Cala and are plundering the threshing floor.'
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.920]   So David inquired of the Lord saying, 'Oh Lord, shall I go and attack these Philistines?'
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.720]   And the Lord said to David, 'Go and attack the Philistines and deliver Cala.'"
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.080]   Okay, cool.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.720]   We have a kind of mounting scenario.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.320]   God is commanding David and his men, "Go fight.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.600]   Go fight for this small nation and deliver them and go fight the Philistines."
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   Right?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.080]   But look at the voice of the men.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.400]   In verse three, it says, "But David's men said, 'Uh, behold, we are afraid here in Judah.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.080]   How much more than if we go to Cala against the ranks of the Philistines?'"
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   Right?
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   You get what's happening?
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:31.840]   It's like, they're like, "We've been running away from Saul for a while now.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   We're already scared.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.520]   Why in the world are we going to go and fight for a nation that's not even ours?"
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   Right?
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.000]   And so David, essentially what he does is he's like, "Uh, yeah, okay, I'll go ask God
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   again."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.480]   You know, it's kind of like if any of you are in the workplace, your boss, like CEO
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.120]   or president says, "I want this done by tonight."
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.280]   And you got to go tell your team, like, "Sorry guys, we got to stay here and go and get this
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   done by tonight."
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.280]   And they're like, "What?
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   No, we can't."
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.760]   And you play this middle man like, "Oh, shoot."
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.200]   I'm just painting for you this picture because I want you to feel like how much anxiety and
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.480]   stress David is under.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.640]   If you've ever been in a situation like that at work, it's incredibly stressful.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.120]   The pressures of the boss on you, "We need to get this done."
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   Your team's like, "We can't."
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.200]   "Okay, what do you do?"
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   Right?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.400]   So David goes back to God and says, "Do we really need to do this?"
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.600]   And God says, "Yes, go."
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.440]   But situations get worse.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.800]   Sometimes when the ball gets rolling, it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.560]   And I know perhaps you guys have felt like that before, where somebody experiences, I
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.880]   don't know, let's say like getting towed, and then they realize that from towing, they
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.480]   lose their license, and it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480]   Okay?
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.000]   I don't know if he's in here, but I'm using a specific analogy right now.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.740]   In either way, it's getting worse for King David.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.040]   What happens is this.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.760]   They go to Kayla to fight, but then check out verse 7.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:04.040]   It was told to Saul that David had come to Kayla, and Saul said, "Ha, God has delivered
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.000]   him into my hand, for he shut himself by entering a city with double gates and bars."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.440]   You can just see Saul like, "Wah!"
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   You know?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.040]   "I've got him!"
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.600]   David has given away his position.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.520]   David was on the run, and now he's been revealed where he's going to be in a city, and now
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.640]   Saul and his soldiers are marching toward Kayla.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.400]   And then David gets really shocked, and he's like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.640]   So David actually asks God, "God, will the people of Kayla that we just saved, I mean
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:42.000]   we just saved their hide, are they going to deliver me to Saul?"
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And God says, "Yes.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.280]   Kayla is going to deliver you into the hands of Saul."
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.640]   And David's like, "What in the world?!"
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   Right?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.900]   And then so what happens is, basically Saul is coming down to kill David.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.700]   But in that moment, God says, "Go," and then King David goes into the mountainsides, the
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.460]   hills, to take refuge.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.980]   And then look at verse 14, it says, "David stayed in the wilderness in the stronghold,
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.740]   and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:17.100]   And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand."
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:22.540]   That's pretty wild for a young boy, young man, to experience.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.620]   Now I don't know if you guys have struggles in your life.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.380]   I am guessing you do.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.380]   Okay?
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.180]   As a matter of fact, you know, recently I had a really good talk with a brother at church,
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.180]   and we were talking about like, what do people in OC actually need?
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.380]   Probably the most thing we need is just like more education, another step in a career,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.260]   like that's what we feel like we need.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.100]   But that's not reality, is it?
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.380]   Right?
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.780]   Because we all have experiences where we feel like we're hurt, we're pain, we're trials,
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.900]   we're anxiety, and we have stress.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.900]   And if you are young and you feel like, "Pretty much my life has been good."
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.580]   Maybe you come from an affluent family, you know, you've gone to the best schools, you've
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.900]   got a job right after, and you're like, "I've got money, time, and freedom.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.900]   I'm pretty good.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.900]   I'm healthy too."
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:17.140]   If you live long enough, your parents might get sick, your parents might die, your family
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:23.180]   members might not be healthy, you might be hurting, you'll have a relational strife,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.540]   you'll have letdowns, you'll have pressures from your bosses.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.260]   And one time or another, you're going to feel, whatever degree it is, whether it's up here
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.140]   or down here, you're going to feel pain.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.140]   Yes?
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.500]   And if you're living life thinking, "No, I won't."
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.060]   I'm just telling you right now, yes, you will.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.060]   Okay?
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   Yes, you will.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:50.860]   But the fact of the matter is, King David is able to give personal testimony that throughout
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:56.140]   that time, although I was, yes, in the wilderness, I had a stronghold.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:02.540]   Although I was in the hillside, running away, and Saul was after me every single day, God
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.220]   did not deliver me.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.340]   That's King David's testimony in chapter 31.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.940]   That's his experience.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.860]   For us, I don't know what your wilderness is.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.460]   I don't know what you're going through.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:21.660]   But do you have a testimony testifying to the fact God has been very faithful?
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.180]   Because that's what we need to do.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.820]   And my challenge is, have we been asking God, "God, be my stronghold, be my strength within
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.580]   those moments."
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.700]   Because that's what we see King David do.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.980]   By way of transitioning into it, I want us to realize as a second point, that this asking,
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:47.660]   this seeking, this having dependence on God, is a learning process.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.820]   Okay?
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.460]   It's a learning process.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.020]   And we all know that.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.640]   But the thing about it is, King David actually talks about it.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.380]   Take a look at verse 21 and 22.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.300]   He says, "Blessed be the Lord, for he has made marvelous his loving kindness to me in
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.500]   a besieged city."
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.020]   So that's why I think this is specifically referring to 1 Samuel 23.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.340]   But then check out verse 22.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:18.500]   "As for me, I said in my alarm, 'I'm cut off from before your eyes.'"
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   So what does he say?
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:25.140]   "When I was surprised, when I was first inflicted with that kind of pain, how did I feel?
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.820]   I felt like you didn't even see me.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.660]   I felt like you didn't even care."
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.140]   And he mentions earlier, "I felt like the guy who nobody even knows about because everybody
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.940]   assumes he's dead."
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.860]   That's how I felt.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.980]   I felt like a broken vessel.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.460]   What do you do with broken vessels?
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.620]   What do you do with broken cups?
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.620]   Broken dishes?
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.900]   Do you like sweep it back up and say, "Oh, precious thing," and put it right back into
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.900]   the cupboard?
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.260]   You throw it away.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.100]   That's how he felt.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.900]   And I'm willing to guess that here in OC, even if you have a nice paying job, a nice
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.700]   house, and a nice looking family, there are still internal pains that you go through.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.180]   Yes?
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.820]   I'm willing to bet that because I've been through stuff.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.380]   I feel like I have a great life.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.220]   From the outside, I feel like I have a really, I don't know what else to say, but a super
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.180]   blessed life.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.780]   Amazing church, amazing family.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.060]   I have parents who constantly look out for me.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.340]   I have an awesome brother who's like my second dad.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.820]   I've got Pastor Peter, the elders.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.940]   I have shared so many times when I first came into this church, I was the one newcomer for
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.540]   the entire church, and the whole church love-bombed me.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.540]   They did.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.900]   And this is a unique thing that I was just so blessed with.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.980]   The first six months of church, we'd always go out to eat.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.580]   I never paid for a single meal.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.380]   It was crazy.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.940]   And after six months, like, "Hey, guys."
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.140]   I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:01.660]   But humanistically speaking, on a very superficial level, I have an amazing life.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.380]   Probably a life that maybe a lot of people are like, "Man, you have it so easy."
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.300]   And in many ways, I do.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.900]   But does that mean I'm free from internal pain?
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.900]   Free from stress?
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.020]   Free from worry?
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.140]   Free from anxiety?
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.420]   Absolutely not.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   Absolutely not.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:25.540]   Here, I want to show you that there is a reality of the learning process of depending on God.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.820]   And King David goes through that.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.420]   He says, "Initially, my eyes, or when I was alarmed, I thought like this."
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.900]   And then he says, "Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my supplication when I cried
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.900]   out to you."
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.900]   Right?
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.460]   "When I cried out to you."
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.540]   But my challenge to you guys is this, is we have pains, you know?
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.260]   I'm just saying right now, we have pains, but do you cry out to the Lord, even with
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.820]   the small stuff in your life?
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:23:02.180]   Because I'm going to make the case to you, you absolutely need a refuge in your life.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.140]   You absolutely need a stronghold, a fortress, somewhere dependable, a safe haven for you
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.500]   to go.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.700]   And that is found in God alone, amen?
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.820]   But regularly, because maybe we go to other stuff, because we go to friends, because we
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.300]   go to possessions, because we typically only trust ourselves, we've gone to many different
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   things.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.500]   Or, because we trust ourselves, we've convinced ourselves for the small stuff, I don't need
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.500]   to cry out to God.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   I don't need to ask for help.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:39.860]   And a lot of us don't ever open up to say, "God, I need you to help me."
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.860]   But you absolutely need it.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.140]   You know, there was a time for me, personally, I remember very distinctly, I've used this
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.980]   in a sermon before, and Bia knows exactly what I'm talking about, where I was in school
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.340]   last year in seminary, was in school part-time, working part-time, church part-time, and I
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.580]   had like multiple facets of my life, newly married, two years into it, you know?
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.180]   And I was getting up early to go to school, I was getting up at five, drive to LA, go
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.860]   to school, come drive straight down, go to work, and then I get off work around 8.30
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.460]   or 9, come home, eat, and then just study, and then crash.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.380]   And then one of these nights, I don't know what it was.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:19.300]   I don't know if it was because the day didn't go well at work, and then I got my first C
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.260]   in seminary in my senior year.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.660]   I was like, "No!"
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.700]   And then I was lying in bed, we were about ready to go to sleep, lights are out, and
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   Bia leans over and she's like, "Are you crying?"
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.380]   You know, because I was just like, I was just like in the moment of like, "This is too much!"
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.380]   You know, like, "I can't take this!"
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.260]   Like, "I don't know."
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:51.900]   Now the thing about it is, you know, just like some of you who are in college, you know,
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.660]   when you guys come and tell me like, "Oh, it's too hard, I'm too busy," and then you
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.580]   guys cry, I'm just like, "You pansy."
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.660]   I'm pretty sure like an older parent who, you know, went through a previous generation,
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   they had hardship.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.500]   They, you know, some of the, like my parents' generation, they come from that war-torn generation,
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.580]   you know?
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.900]   And so when they think of hardship, they don't think like, "Oh, so you're tired."
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.220]   So they're looking at me like, "You pansy," you know?
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:25.500]   But here's the truth of the matter is, if I don't know how to go to refuge in what is
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:30.260]   seemingly small, yes, I was weak in the moment, I was young, and I didn't know how to handle
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.580]   it, so I started crying.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.220]   But if I didn't know how to find refuge in that moment, what makes me think I'm going
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.660]   to find refuge when harder things come in life?
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   Right?
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.380]   If you're not going to God with the smaller things of your life, do you think you're going
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.300]   to go to God with the bigger things in life?
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.140]   You might say, "Yeah."
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.140]   No you won't.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.500]   You don't know how to swim there, you don't know how to ask, you don't, you have never
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.860]   had that interaction.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.740]   How are you going to trust a God with big things when you can't trust Him with little
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.500]   things?
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.300]   My argument is you absolutely need a refuge in God for everything.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:11.540]   And Christ was trying to teach us, "Even for your daily bread, you need me."
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.460]   But for some odd reason, we've convinced ourselves, "No, I don't."
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.260]   And that's sad.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.820]   That's dangerous.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.540]   And I want us to be prepared.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.740]   If we live long enough, we are going to experience things where we're going to cry, and we're
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.860]   going to cry out.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.460]   And I'm not just preaching this because of what's been going on in the past several weeks,
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.260]   but I want you to know that, yeah, in the past several weeks, many of us have been heartbroken
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.140]   because of Emily's passing.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:47.220]   And I think about stuff like that, you know, as a parent, I've counseled several people
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:57.580]   who've lost their children, and there are just things you cannot fix.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.220]   When I was overburdened with work, my initial reaction was, "Okay, I just need to clamp
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.020]   down and work harder.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.060]   I just need to use my time better.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.700]   I just need to enlist the help of my wife.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.460]   I just need to enlist the help of my pastor.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.500]   I need to enlist the help of this person."
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.660]   And that's typically what we do.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.580]   I need to do X, I need to do Y, I need to do this.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:22.920]   But when stuff in life happens that are way beyond us, you can't do anything.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.820]   So where else are you going to turn?
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.440]   And it's not just because of what's happening with that family, but if you just imagine
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.700]   for a moment how many people in this room alone right now have parents who have cancer,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:40.340]   have brothers who have cancer, have cousins who have cancer.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.660]   I think we've been fooled to think the regularity in life is peace and comfort and health, but
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:52.620]   actually for most of all generations past, all of history, peace and comfort was the
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.620]   irregularity.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.180]   Rather, hardships and suffering was what's regular.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.300]   My question is, do we understand the process of trusting in God and turning to Him?
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.420]   Have we cried out to Him?
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:10.880]   Have we learned to ask God, "God, You're different from the ground that the woman landed on because
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.560]   she couldn't tell the ground, 'I'm weak, come help me.'"
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:22.380]   But because God is a person who loves, who cares and sees, you can ask God, "God, come
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.980]   be my rock.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.060]   Come be my shelter.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   Come be my strength."
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.060]   Amen?
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.060]   Amen.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:36.100]   Now, as we think about that, King David, as he's learning then in this progress and in
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.580]   his learning, he comes to a point where he starts to express his confidence in God.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:47.660]   And that's our next point, that you will build confidence.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.300]   Build confidence in the person.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:57.020]   Verse three and four, he says, "For you, you are my rock and my fortress.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.940]   For your namesake, you will lead me and guide me.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.300]   You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, for you are my
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   strength."
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:12.260]   That to me is awesome because you see this genuineness.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.940]   Isn't this the case for most of us?
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.980]   "God, please help."
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.980]   But I believe it.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.980]   You are my help.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.980]   There's this mixture.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.260]   There's this mixture of request and confidence.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.660]   There's this mixture of you're asking, but you already know.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.660]   Right?
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.660]   This is typical.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.460]   This is very typical of the Christian as he experiences, or she experiences, wrestling
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.860]   in pain in life.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.700]   That as we're asking God, "God, you are my fortress."
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.380]   I mean, sorry, "Be my stronghold and save me."
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.060]   At the same time, he's saying, "You are my fortress.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.740]   You are my help."
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:50.580]   And so this is the kind of perspective that we're always trying to strive for.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.700]   This is what we're fighting.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.700]   This is the spiritual battle in our mind and in our hearts, isn't it?
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:02.020]   To gain that perspective that is of the word of God and of spiritual truth.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.140]   Right now, I'm confused.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.700]   But God, you know what's going on.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.620]   Right now, in the moment, I feel like you're not helping me.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.780]   But I know you are the great helper.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.980]   Right?
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.140]   Right now, it hurts a lot.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.260]   But I know this isn't forever.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.380]   I know your grace abounds.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.180]   There is this growth and perspective that needs to happen.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.420]   And this is exactly what Apostle Paul challenges us to have.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.100]   There is a passage in 2 Corinthians 4.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:37.300]   It says, "For this light and momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:41.620]   beyond all comparison as we look."
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.620]   Okay?
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.860]   "As we look, not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:54.380]   For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.460]   There is this bigger perspective that Apostle Paul is challenging us to have.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.700]   The people that he's talking to, they have been afflicted with much persecution.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:09.140]   He himself, beatings and stoning and whipping and mocking.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:15.980]   And then he says, "There is this light and momentary affliction I endured, but I only
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.740]   see it as light and momentary because I see a bigger perspective of God."
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.780]   Right?
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.300]   He has his sights on what's eternal.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.580]   And that's exactly what we need.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:35.060]   I know, again, not for us, our immediate response, typically to pain, is to look at the pain.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.060]   Why did it happen?
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.060]   Isn't that typically the first response we have?
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.580]   You start looking at the pain, you're like, "Why?
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.780]   Who did it?
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.780]   And what's going to happen to me after?
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.420]   How do I get that guy?"
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.620]   So rather than looking for refuge, rather than getting a bigger perspective, we go to
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.380]   the armor, we get some weapons, and we're like, "Okay, I'm going to kill this thing."
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.380]   You know?
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.620]   I feel like that's typically how we respond to things.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.700]   But rather, the Scriptures are teaching us, we need to broaden our horizon to see the
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.980]   God who is greater.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.140]   He is a refuge.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:11.300]   There is this cool place in Arizona, it's called Montezuma's Castle.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.460]   Truthfully, they say historically it has nothing to do with Montezuma.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.340]   I don't know why it's called the Montezuma's Castle.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.460]   Have you guys ever heard of it?
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.180]   It's in Arizona, Flagstaff.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.140]   Just Google it for a picture sometime.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.460]   I wish I had a photo on the screen.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:34.500]   But it's a pretty amazing thing because there's this huge wall, and it's a cliff, basically,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.900]   but it's curved like this.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.740]   So it's like a big arch.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:46.220]   But then on this huge four-story wall are engraved, are carved out caves.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.740]   And you can tell people were living there.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:52.500]   And people said that people, when they were fighting the indigenous people and stuff like
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:58.620]   that, they would run into this castle for safety and fortress.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:04.820]   King David, remember, he's actually running through the wilderness, running away from
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.300]   ambush and raids by King Saul.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:12.780]   And he's literally taking shelter, probably on a hill, with a huge rock.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:17.740]   And then he's saying in his mind, "God is like this.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.740]   This is my God."
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.740]   He's trusting.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.740]   He's being encouraged.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:26.660]   And he's seeing it for himself that God is protecting him.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.980]   My challenge to you is, I hope you guys have your eyes open so that even if right now you're
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:36.940]   going through pain, even if right now you're going through trials, you can at least look
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.460]   back into your life for moments to which God has been faithful.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:46.060]   Moments to which God has brought you through, moments to which God has ministered to you.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.500]   Because from your own personal experiences, you're going to gain that kind of confidence.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.460]   You will build this idea that God is dependable.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.980]   Because on one level, I can believe God is dependable because of the testimony of people
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   like David.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.020]   Throughout history, God has been faithful.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:11.980]   To the generations from Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, all these people, God has been faithful
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   to them.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   How can I not trust him?
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.580]   That's one way.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.940]   I can believe that he's faithful because of the testimony of other people and I see it,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.780]   but it is a stronger testimony when he has been faithful to your own life.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.500]   And those small testimonies start building for you a greater dependency in God.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.180]   Does that make sense?
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.980]   It's just like any other thing.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.300]   It's just like any other thing.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.860]   In sports, if you have a superstar who is a basketball player and there is this idea
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.100]   or there is this moment where someone needs to be clutch, you don't get the guy who has
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.860]   been 0 for 7.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.900]   The guy who has been proven to be clutch every single time, what do you do?
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.260]   You say, "Here's the ball."
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:01.860]   I might be a 6'6", tall, be able to dunk, run fastest, whatever, but I still say, "That
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.620]   guy who has proven to be clutch, what do I do?
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.620]   Here's the ball."
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.620]   Right?
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.660]   That's what I'm talking about when I say we need to gain this kind of confidence that
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.620]   King David expresses in his life towards God.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:23.520]   Now, I want you to focus on that analogy for a moment because there is some weird interplay
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.080]   of different concepts with all that we're talking about today, about trusting God and
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.940]   being dependent on the Lord.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.340]   Because what comes first?
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.780]   Do I just blindly trust somebody?
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.740]   This is when maybe some of you, you told a friend, "Oh my gosh, this week has been so
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.740]   hard.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.380]   I really don't know if I can go on.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.380]   I feel like quitting."
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.660]   Then someone says, "Trusting God."
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:55.220]   You're like, "Okay, you're no help."
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:04.140]   Because all it sounds like is just that kind of idiomatic, "Just believe.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.140]   Just do it."
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.940]   It's just kind of like, "It doesn't help me that much."
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.660]   So that's why I'm saying you have to have this testimony.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.340]   You have to build a confidence.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.260]   You have to see his character.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.760]   That's what I'm telling you.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   So what comes first, though?
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:22.580]   Do I have to first see, "Okay, God, prove yourself to be dependable.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.380]   Who else have you, give me your resume.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.740]   Let me see in the Bible first.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.420]   Who has he done this for?"
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.420]   And then I trust him?
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.180]   Or do I trust him first?
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.660]   Or what needs to happen?
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:40.140]   And obviously it's a both interplay of one contributing to the other.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.100]   You're seeing that he is dependable, reliable, and absolutely faithful.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:50.360]   The one who is true, and what's more, as you trust him, that builds greater confidence
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:56.140]   in him as well, because now you have a personal experience that you've risked with him.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.300]   Right?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:03.140]   You've risked yourself and been vulnerable with him, and he's proven himself to be true.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:09.700]   But there's another concept I want to throw into that mix, which is for you, if you want
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:17.100]   to truly depend on God, there needs to be actually a handing over of the ball.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.020]   Right?
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.620]   So look what it says in verse five.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.060]   Turn your eyes there.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.860]   He says, "Into your hand I commit my spirit.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.620]   You have ransomed me, O Lord, God of truth."
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.860]   And in some translations, God of faithfulness.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.500]   What is he saying?
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:45.580]   The last point is going to be true, submissive dependency.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.740]   There is a submissive dependency unlike any other dependency that we practice in the world.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.260]   Right?
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:58.420]   And there is a kind of trust that we practice in pain, in trial, in suffering, that we perhaps
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:02.220]   don't practice in any other context.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:08.620]   In more like the, you know, wishy-washy mainstream Christianity, there has been this phrase,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.540]   "Let go and let God."
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.340]   In my mind, that makes no sense.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.420]   What does that even mean, "Let go and let God"?
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.820]   Let go and let God do what?
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.940]   There's a problem here.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:28.180]   What needs to actually happen is in the context of suffering, okay, I know this is going to
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.900]   get a little bit, I need to explain it.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.900]   So let me have all your attention so I can explain it clearly.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.260]   And this is what I'm going to say.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:43.740]   Specifically to the context of suffering, there is a battle of the will.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.500]   Okay?
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.780]   Every single moment in your life, there needs to be a reconciliation of two wills.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.060]   Is it going to be God's will for your life or is it going to be your will?
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:00.380]   And regularly as a Christian, your will continues to die and gives way to the will of God, right?
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.420]   That reconciliation and the battle of the two wills becomes all the more prominent when
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.180]   we suffer.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:14.020]   Because it's when we suffer when our desire, when our will, when our whatever it is that
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.620]   we want becomes strongest.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:22.340]   And so even in this moment, there has to be a submission.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.580]   And to me, when someone says, "Just let go and let God," it's confusing because what
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.380]   if God doesn't want to relieve you yet?
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.140]   And yet you're sitting here like, "Don't worry, God's going to relieve you, so just let go
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.700]   and let Him do it."
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.300]   God has purposes for us to which we don't even know.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.180]   What if God desires to allow us to go through certain things so that we would be grown,
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.140]   so that we would have our eyes open, so that we would wake up?
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.580]   What if God desires for us to do those things just like the blind man so that he receives
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.580]   glory?
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.540]   What if like Apostle Paul says, we're to suffer because of the sake of the gospel, for the
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.460]   building up of this church, for the magnification of Christ?
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.140]   Those purposes I don't know yet.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:12.980]   But how can I demand, "God, in this scenario, I want you to do what I want."
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:24.260]   And so there is this profound, profound element of you and me and King David, I can ask.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.260]   It's okay to ask.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.260]   Why?
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.660]   Because God's our Father and He loves us.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.220]   He's told us, "Ask me."
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.020]   You don't have because you don't ask.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.740]   But then even when, let's say, our questions are being unanswered, there is a decision
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.740]   for us.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:45.260]   Am I going to put that into God's hands or am I going to hold on to it?
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.080]   And the longer we hold on to it, the more painful it will be.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:58.740]   And so Dr. Greg Harris, one of my professors, I remember that he had lost a child.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:04.220]   And I remember praying with him and I remember him sharing with me the story.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:10.820]   And I remember him vividly telling me that it was like God asking me to put the daughter
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.740]   into his hand.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:17.540]   And my professor writing about it in his book, I couldn't let go.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:21.860]   And again, I think about Aaron and Tina and how hard it must be.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.380]   There are things in life that we can just readily let go.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.980]   I really wanted my job to succeed.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.220]   It was a huge burden, but I could let go because I fail all the time.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.220]   You know?
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.100]   My schooling, yeah, I wanted an A, but I could let go.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.020]   It's just a grade.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:41.300]   But there are things in life that are much difficult, isn't it?
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.020]   If God said, "Put it in my hand."
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.580]   Like, if it was my kids.
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:55.900]   But for us, we have to realize that true dependency on God requires that kind of willingness
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.140]   to surrender.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.960]   Right?
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.700]   And then for us to trust, God is the author of my life from beginning to end.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.620]   He's not the God who just started my life and then now it's just been going awry.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:14.180]   He is the author from beginning and end and therefore, he will write the conclusion.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:23.580]   And so then, even if I die and even if I go through this, there, you take control.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.380]   That's where we need to be.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.660]   That's the kind of dependency we need to have.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.660]   And that's the kind of dependency that Christ said, "Did you know that this very verse,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:38.340]   verse five, 'Into your hand I commit my spirit'" doesn't that sound so familiar?
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.740]   That was Christ.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.500]   That was Jesus Christ saying to his Father.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.860]   I mean, truthfully speaking, you've probably heard this many times.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:55.900]   The cross of Christ is the most backwards thing in all of history to all mankind.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.740]   The most pure, perfect, obedient one being punished on the cross.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.700]   The one who has dignity, the one who has glory being shamed on the cross.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.020]   It's absolutely backwards.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.660]   It shouldn't be.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:15.660]   But Christ says, "Lord, into your hand I commit my life."
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.900]   You know who else said this?
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.260]   Stephen, when he was being martyred.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.620]   He was a faithful one who was serving the church.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.100]   He was a faithful one who knew the scriptures.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.340]   He was sharing the gospel in the synagogue.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:30.820]   And then the Jewish people who were to be religious, they get angry at him, they mob
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.100]   him, they gnash their teeth at him, pull him, and they stone him.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   And what does he say?
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.660]   "To you I commit my spirit."
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.300]   This is the words of the apostles.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.580]   This is the words of the saints.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.100]   This is the words of the martyrs.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.420]   John Haas, Martin Luther.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.780]   These were the words of men who trusted and understood.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.900]   God is so good, he will preserve my life even through death.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:57.560]   And I pray that we all would be ready to say that too.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:02.260]   We might not be in like a world of pain right now.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.620]   We might not be in a world of hurt right now.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.500]   But my challenge to you again, even for the small things in your life, are you going to
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.500]   God?
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.500]   Is he your refuge?
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.880]   He has to be.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.760]   He has to be.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:21.060]   So Paul says in 2 Timothy chapter 1, he says, "Therefore do not be ashamed to the testimony
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.060]   about our Lord.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:28.360]   Nor of me, his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God, who saved
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.980]   us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but because of his own purpose
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:33.980]   and grace."
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.760]   He says, "Which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, which now has been
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.580]   manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:51.180]   life and immortality to light through the gospel, for which I was appointed a preacher
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:55.540]   and apostle and teacher, which is why I suffer as I do."
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.540]   Listen to this.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:04.000]   "I am not ashamed, because I know whom I believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.940]   until that day."
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.820]   That's so cool.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.160]   That's the kind of perspective I want.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.860]   That's the kind of perspective I pray for you.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:22.500]   I pray that whatever the circumstance, whatever the issue is, whatever the pain is, that you
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:30.720]   would have such a confidence in God, that you would be willing to ask, "God, help me."
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.780]   It's not just okay to ask, it is commanded to ask, it is good for you to ask your heavenly
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.200]   father for help.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.020]   Is it wrong for you to ask God to remove pain from your life?
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.620]   No, it is not.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.300]   It's not wrong at all.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.880]   Ask God for relief.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.180]   Ask God for help.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.720]   Ask God for strength.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.260]   Ask God for protection.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:46:00.220]   But I pray that we would also be submissive and dependent enough, and trust him enough,
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.420]   that if the good God and the author of my life sees it fit that I go through it all,
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.220]   then may it be so.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:12.980]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.740]   Our father, we trust you because you are our God.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.140]   We trust you because you have delivered so many.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:25.460]   And father, we trust you because you have already delivered us and freed us from our
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:31.660]   own sin, from our own plight, and from the weakness of our own power.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.460]   I pray, father God, if there is anybody in here who is hurting, that the love of God
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.240]   would fill them.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:43.060]   And God, that you would let them know that you preserve all of your children.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.660]   And God, that they can be strong and have heart and courage because there is hope in
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:47.660]   the Lord.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.060]   We pray this for the Choi family.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:56.740]   We pray for this for everybody who is around, who has family who is hurting.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.220]   And as we know, father God, sometimes the greatest pains is when we see pain in the
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.900]   people around us.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.460]   I pray all the more that this would cause us to desire so eagerly to share the love
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.340]   and light of Christ.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.500]   There is no hope anywhere else but in you, Lord.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.060]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:20.340]   Why don't we just take the next couple of minutes just to really reflect on the message
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:41.780]   that we heard this morning.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.120]   (moves to gentle music)

[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.780]   - Let's pray.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:43.280]   Father God, Lord, you are our cornerstone, Lord.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.780]   We find our refuge in you, Lord,
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.280]   'cause we know that you are eternal, Lord,
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.280]   and everything on this world is temporary, Lord.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.780]   We understand, Lord, that you mean everything to us, Lord,
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   that without you, Lord, there is no life,
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.280]   there is no purpose to live.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.780]   We have no worth because we find our worth in you, Lord.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.280]   So would you just continue to just allow us
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.780]   just to be able to strive after you,
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.280]   that we find our comfort and trust in you,
