[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.120]   God, as we come off a holiday week,
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   spending time with family, but also making sure
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.620]   that we are mindful of all that we have in Christ,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.120]   I pray, God, that by our sight of you,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.120]   considering all that you are, that you have done,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.620]   and all the work that, God, you have done in our lives,
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.120]   that our hearts will be overflowing with gratitude.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.620]   And God, although the weeks and days go by quickly,
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.120]   and although our weeks may be filled with various--
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.620]   both responsibilities, distractions, burdens,
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.120]   and more, in every season, God, we want to give you thanks.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   And particularly tonight, as we think about your word,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.620]   our fellowship in the scripture, and the opportunity
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.620]   to gather together in this way, we
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.620]   are grateful, Lord, for the privilege.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.620]   Father, we want to lift this time of praise to you,
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.620]   and we pray, God, that more and more,
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.120]   by continuing to devote ourselves,
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.120]   devote our attention to you, God,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.620]   would you continue to grow our faith.

[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.120]   OK, good evening, everybody.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.620]   Just a few highlight of announcements.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:58.120]   So just in case you guys are kind of wondering
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.620]   about the schedule again, December 14, Wednesday,
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.120]   is our last study.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   That last study is going to be a wrap-up summary.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   So please just make a mental note of that.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.120]   And then soon, we're going to be starting our sign-ups
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.120]   for the next session.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.620]   So you're going to see both emails.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.620]   And then next week, we're going to have a time
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.620]   where I'll introduce to you how to sign up
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.620]   for the next series, OK?
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.120]   Please remember that this weekend on Sunday
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.620]   is our communion service, OK?
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.620]   So please take time to just prepare your heart, pray,
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.620]   spend extra time communing with the Lord,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.120]   repent of any sins that are in your heart,
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.120]   always be thinking about how grateful we
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.620]   are for the Lord's sacrifice, and come
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.120]   ready to participate on the special service, OK?
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.120]   All right, at this time, please go ahead and go
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   into your discussion groups.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.620]   Thanks.

[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.880]   of the passages that we're going to be looking at
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   before we wrap up. So we have this week,
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   and then we have one more week next week, and then the week,
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   the final week is basically going to be a wrap-up study.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   Okay? And so the wrap-up study is important because
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   we don't want you to just finish the study and
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   kind of like, "Oh, we went through the text," but we want you to be
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   able to, after four months later, and I say,
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   "Chapter 3, 2 Peter," like, "What's it about?"
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   Right? And if somebody brings up a subject like,
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   "Is there a book that I can study on the last days
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.880]   or about false prophets? What's a book that you would recommend
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   or what's a chapter?" And so you can flip over to that
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   and then you can kind of, you know, recollect some of the things
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   that you studied. So it's not just something that you just have a notch
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   under your belt that you did. That's something that you can actually
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   use, practically speaking. Okay? All right, so let me pray
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.880]   for us and then we'll jump into the text.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   continued grace and love. We pray that your word
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.880]   would truly speak to us. And we know, Father God,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.880]   that your word and what you've given us
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   is sufficient and that everything
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   for life of godliness that you've given to us in the knowledge of his Son.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.880]   And so we pray, Father God, that you would bless this time,
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   help us to glean from it and
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   gain insight, and not only for knowledge
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.880]   but for purpose of sanctification. In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.880]   Amen. All right.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   So as you guys know, 2 Peter is
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.880]   Peter's last letter that he writes.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   Right? Before he...
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   Right after this, he gets arrested. According to church tradition,
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.880]   he gets arrested, he gets martyred, and he gets
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.880]   beheaded. Right? And he gets beheaded and that's it. And he
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   knows this is coming. We saw that in the letter. He mentions it.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   Right? He knows that the end is coming. So, this is
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.880]   the last section of the last letter that he's writing.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.880]   So imagine in your mind, if you're writing a
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.880]   letter to a bunch of your disciples and this is the very
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.880]   last thing you're going to say to them and they know that trouble
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.880]   is coming, obviously he's going to die because of persecution
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   coming. And they're not going to just come after
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   Peter. They're going to come after Peter's disciples. They're going to come after the churches.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.880]   And so this is the last section
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   of the last letter he writes before he gets beheaded.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   Or not beheaded. Sorry. He gets crucified upside down.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.880]   Paul is the one who's beheaded. Nobody said anything when I said
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   beheaded. Okay? So, you can
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.880]   kind of, you know, like consider the weightiness of what he is
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.880]   saying. So, he's wrapping up what he is saying,
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   right, in the three chapters and basically telling them
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   like, remember this. If you forget everything,
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.880]   you know, remember this. Right? So,
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.880]   as you know, he, the purpose of this
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   is since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   sort of people ought you to be? And this is sort of the conclusion
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   of everything that he's saying. So, he wasn't just trying to give them
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.880]   information, but through the information to do what?
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   So, they could live a certain way. Right?
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   They would not be afraid that even if persecution
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   comes and even if they end up dying for their faith
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   to remember that Christ is coming.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.880]   Right? And so, as a result of that,
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   how should you live? Not simply how should you think,
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   but how should you live? You should think this way so you can
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.880]   live this way. Right? So, if all
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.880]   Bible study is, is helping you
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.880]   to understand what the Bible says, it actually does
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.880]   more harm than good. People
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.880]   who are not walking right with God, filling them
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   with more knowledge actually causes you to be
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   proud. Right? It causes you to be
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   proud. So, proud people, you add more knowledge, it actually does
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   more damage. So, at the end of the day, Peter is
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.880]   not trying to get more information into them. The information
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   has practical application. Right? So, the question that we need to ask
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   ourselves is, how does your life get affected
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.880]   by the text that you're looking at? Other than the fact
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   that you have to study and then you have to study next week and the week after that.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   Outside of that, how does it affect? And so, one of the discussion
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.880]   questions that we'll have at the end is, specifically, how
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.880]   does the end times, the thought of end times, does that
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.880]   have any practical effect on your life? Okay?
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   So, this is what Peter was trying to get at. Right?
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.880]   What sort of people should you be
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   considering the destruction that's coming? Right? The
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.880]   judgment that's coming. So, in the previous week
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   where I was in here, in verse 10, just as a review,
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.880]   it says, "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.880]   elements will be destroyed with intense heat and the earth
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   and its works will be burned up."
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   In other words, everything that you're concerned about, everything that you're
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.880]   worried about losing is going to be destroyed.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.880]   Right? So, don't be afraid of that.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   Don't be afraid of losing whatever it is that you're working
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   so hard to get because in the end it's going to be burned up anyway.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   Right? So, considering that, when
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   Christ comes, all things are going to be made new.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.880]   What kind of person ought you to be in
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.880]   holy conduct and godliness? So, what is the difference between holy conduct
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.880]   and godliness? Right? So, when you do an
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   inductive Bible study, hopefully you are asking these questions, right?
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.880]   What's the difference between the two? These are the questions that you
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   should be asking in order to gain insight.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   Can somebody, did you find anything, the difference between
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   the two?
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   Can you have one without the other?
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   Yes and no.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.880]   Okay. Hopefully you had
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   some time to look it up, right? These words. Holy conduct
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   basically is external.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.880]   Right? It's how you live.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   Godliness
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   is more holistic.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   It's
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.880]   reference to piety. It includes piety.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   Right? Devotion.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.880]   But the larger definition,
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.880]   it says
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.880]   whole of true
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   religion. This is what it says in the
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   Bible dictionary. In the words of the
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   Bible. In the word study. Right? Whole of
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.880]   true religion. Meaning godliness
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   is reference to our whole conduct. Inward and
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.880]   outward. Toward God and toward one another.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   Holy conduct is specifically the way that you are behaving.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.880]   Right? So, can you have one without the other?
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   Can you have
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   holy conduct without godliness?
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   Yes, you can. Right? You can behave
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.880]   a certain way and change your external behavior without
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   being godly. Right? Who are those people?
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.880]   Pharisees.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.880]   Right? They're really good at following
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   rules. But they weren't godly people.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   Right? God, can you have
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.880]   godliness without holy conduct?
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.880]   No, you can't.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.880]   Because godliness encompasses holy conduct.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   Right? Because godliness is reference to your whole being.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.880]   Right? And so, he's saying that in
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.880]   these last days, right, not only in your
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   external behavior but in everything else, right,
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   how should you behave? Looking and
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.880]   hastening. So, this word
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   keeps coming up here. Looking. Looking.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.880]   If you go to the next verse, right, beloved
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   since you are looking for these things. So, over and over
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   again. So, what is this idea of looking?
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   And what's the
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   difference between looking and hastening?
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   I'm trying to figure out if you are afraid to speak or you didn't do it.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.880]   Looking has the idea of hoping.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.880]   Right?
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   Your inner being of what you're thinking about
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   the future. Hoping. Hastening is reference to
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   action. Right? Did you find that?
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   In your word study. If you just go back and look up
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   the words, this is what it says in the dictionary.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   Okay? Not English dictionary but the
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.880]   Greek dictionary. That's one of the key things that you want to have when you're
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   doing inductive Bible study. Right? So, when you look it up,
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.880]   it's hoping. So, in your conduct, in your godliness,
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   it begins with hope.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.880]   Right? So, if the coming of the end,
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   the day of the Lord, day of God, day of Christ,
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   right, and all of those words are used
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   interchangeably. Okay? There are some people
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.880]   who will tell you, well, day of Christ means this, day of God means this, and day of the
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   Lord means this. If you look at all the
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   verses and how it's used, typically it's used interchangeably.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.880]   There's no specific line. Okay?
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   So, when the day of God comes,
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   right, if you're not hoping, you're not going to be hastening.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.880]   Right? Because if you're hastening,
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.880]   right, if you're taking action without hoping,
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   what is your life going to look like?
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.880]   Probably holy conduct without godliness.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   You understand what I'm saying?
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   Right? You're changing your behavior but your
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   inner person is not changing because your motivation
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   is not because of his coming.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   Right? You're not inwardly being motivated.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.880]   You're outwardly being motivated. So, that's why he says
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.880]   considering the destruction, considering that all things are going to be
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.880]   gone, that Christ is coming, right,
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.880]   in your holy conduct, inside and out, in
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   who you are, in hoping,
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   right, in your hoping, hasten,
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   action, take action.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   Because the coming of the day of God is coming.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   Right? Now,
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   almost everybody
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.880]   believes, Christian or non-Christians, believe the end is coming.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   Right?
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.880]   Yes or no? Right? Almost everybody.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   Whether you think it's going to come because of war,
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.880]   right, some people may say maybe we're going to have
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.880]   World War III and nuclear bombs are going to go off and
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.880]   there's going to be an end. So, everybody's afraid of
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.880]   World War III. There's some people
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   who say that because of climate change, right,
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.880]   and some alarmists are saying that this is going to happen
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   in the next 10, 15 years if you don't change the course of
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   time, you know, the earth is going to burn up so the end is going to
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   come. Right? Or there's going to be
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.880]   some sort of asteroids the size of
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.880]   California is going to hit earth one day and then we're going to blow up
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   and we're going to disappear. Or maybe the aliens
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   are going to come, you know, and they're going to take over.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   Or maybe AI is going to come and they can take over.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   So, the talk of the end, depending on who you talk to,
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   everybody has some idea,
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.880]   right, whatever your people may believe,
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.880]   that clearly there's any,
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   anything can happen that can bring the end.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.880]   So, if you are afraid of nuclear
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.880]   war, right, being politics, then
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   what's going to end up happening? You're going to get really into politics.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.880]   Right? You're going to say, "What's America doing?
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   What's China doing? What's Iran doing? What's Russia doing?"
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.880]   And so you're going to be paying very close attention to that because
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   you're afraid that if something goes wrong here
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.880]   that the end is going to come. There's a lot
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.880]   of people, right, whatever your
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   opinion may be, thinks that the world is going to end
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   if we don't change the way that we use
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.880]   fossil fuel and all this stuff. And so we have political
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   ideas on that and some people are doing crazy things
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.880]   because they think the world is going to come to an end.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   So, most people believe that there
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   is going to be some kind of an end. That's why there's all this money being spent
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.880]   trying to get to Mars, right? Why are you going to Mars
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   if you're not afraid? People are thinking about going to Mars because
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.880]   they think at some point there's going to come an end, right?
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.880]   So, depending on what you think is going to bring an end,
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.880]   that's where you're probably going to spend your energy.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.880]   So, he's saying as Christians, we are told the end
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.880]   is coming, right? It's part of
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   our belief system. It's part of the gospel
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   that we embrace, that end is coming.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   And this end isn't by accident. It's not simply because
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   we're driving cars or riding planes. It says it's
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.880]   going to be a deliberate judgment from God, right?
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.880]   That's what it says. And so, because the end
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   is coming, how should you behave?
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   So, in other words, if the end is coming,
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.880]   our natural thought is going to be,
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   how are we going to survive that?
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   If you think it's climate change, you have to change the climate. If you think it's nuclear war,
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   you have to get rid of nuclear weapons. If you think it's
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.880]   aliens, find them and destroy them first, right?
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.880]   Whatever it may be, if you think
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.880]   the end is coming, your natural response to that is, how are we going
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.880]   to survive that? And so, he's saying as
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   Christians, he said he made it very clear
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   that these ends come. In fact, if we look at these texts,
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   Peter says it,
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.880]   he started the first letter this way, "Therefore, prepare your minds
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.880]   And then based on the grace that's going to
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.880]   be brought to you, how should you live?
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   In Romans chapter 8,
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   we are given, again, this is a very
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   small snippet of, remember when we were going through Revelation,
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   a lot of you guys who are here,
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.880]   a whole book of Revelation is a reminder to us,
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.880]   it gives us a visual picture of how this is going to end.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.880]   Remember the three judgments?
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.880]   Seven, seven, seven judgments in the book of Revelation.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.880]   What is the first set of judgments that come?
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   The seal judgments, and then the seventh seal
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   opens up which set of seven?
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.880]   Trumpet judgments. And then on the seventh trumpet,
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.880]   what judgments come? Seven bowls judgment.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   So, if you remember, as we were studying, the judgment gets much more
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.880]   intense as we go. So, Revelation 8
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.880]   is right in the middle of that, the trumpet judgments.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.880]   And this is how it's described, "For I consider that the sufferings
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.880]   of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   glory that is to be revealed to us. For the anxious
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.880]   longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.880]   of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.880]   to futility." Sorry, this is, I'm going to get to the other verse.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   "Not willingly, but because of him who
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.880]   subjected it in hope that the creation itself also would be set
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.880]   free from slavery to corruption into the freedom
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.880]   of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.880]   groans and suffers pains the child were together until now."
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.880]   Okay? I don't know if you've ever
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.880]   studied this passage before, but the Bible says
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.880]   that creation is also under the judgment as
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   man is under judgment because we were created to
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.880]   be the subduers of the land. So, when we were corrupted,
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.880]   the Bible says that the earth also was corrupted.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.880]   And so, before the fall, before sin came
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   in, Adam and Eve labored and bore
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.880]   fruit. But remember, as a result of sin,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   remember what he said what was going to happen?
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   Instead of bearing fruit,
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.880]   they're going to bear thorns and thistles. Meaning
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.880]   the creation itself was corrupted.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   So, humanly speaking, like we
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.880]   see the corruption of creation and we're trying to fix it by
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   not riding airplanes and not burning fuel.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   But the Bible says the creation was corrupted along with us.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   And it's eagerly waiting for the sons of man to appear. Meaning
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.880]   restoration to happen to us so that the creation
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.880]   itself will be restored. Creation will
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   not be restored until what's taken care of. Not
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   we become better stewards of the planet.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.880]   No, better stewards of our souls.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.880]   Right? When God restores our souls
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.880]   to what God intended, He will restore us back
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   into what He intended. Both man and
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   creation. Right? That's why
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.880]   it...
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   What was that passage?
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.880]   In Revelation 8, 7, 3, this is the trumpet judgment.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   So the first sounded and came hail
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   and fire mixed with blood and they were thrown to the
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.880]   earth and third of the earth was burned, burned up and the third of
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up. You notice
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.880]   how much he says burning. The second angel sounded
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.880]   and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   and a third of the sea became blood. Third of the creatures which were
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.880]   in the sea had life, died and the third of ships
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   were destroyed. The third angel sounded and a great star
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   fell from heaven burning like a torch and it fell on the third
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   of the rivers. And again, over and over again, here
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.880]   the emphasis on burning.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   Right? So if you look here
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   he says because of which the heavens will be destroyed
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   by burning, right? And that specific
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   passage that we're talking about is in reference to this and the
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.880]   elements will melt. Right?
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.880]   Now, I heard some people
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.880]   asking the question why is the heaven in plural?
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   Right?
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.880]   There's no big reason.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.880]   Okay, I don't know if you had deep theological discussions about the
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   S here. If you look up the word heavens
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.880]   right? In plural, it will say
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.880]   that heavens, singular, and heavens, plural
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.880]   is used interchangeably in the Bible. Right?
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.880]   So I hope your discussion wasn't too deep.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.880]   Right? It's used interchangeably.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:06.880]   If you want to get technical, you could technically say
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   heavens basically is covering everything
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.880]   that is not physical. So you can say it's plural
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.880]   for that reason, but if you look up the dictionary it just simply
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.880]   says that's just the way it's used sometimes.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   Right? So the heavens
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.880]   again, if you want to distinguish the heavens by burning the elements
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.880]   basically you probably heard that statement heaven and
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   earth, heaven and earth. Right? Heaven and earth basically
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   means material and immaterial.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   And it's a way of describing all creation.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.880]   Right? Not just a particular part. It will all melt away
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   with intense heat. Right?
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.880]   Everything that you value, your clothes,
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.880]   your car, your house, everything material will burn
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   away. Everything that is not material, the things that you're
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   concerned about, your reputation, right?
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.880]   Your honor, your glory, all of that is going to be burned.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.880]   That's basically what it's saying. So everything
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.880]   that we worry so much about that causes us
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.880]   sleeplessness, all of that is going to be gone
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.880]   one day. Right?
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.880]   So knowing that, what kind of people should
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   you be? Right?
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   If everything is going to be gone tomorrow, how will it affect
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   the way you live today? Would it affect
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.880]   your value system? According to the promise, looking
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.880]   again, hoping for the new heavens and the
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.880]   new earth. Okay? And this
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   statement here, new heavens and new earth, is
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.880]   a restoration back to what God intended.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   Right? And this language is all over. If you looked it up, you
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.880]   probably have found it all over.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.880]   Isaiah 65, 17, "For behold, I create
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   new heavens and new earth, and the former things will
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.880]   not be remembered." Right? It's talking
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.880]   about when restoration comes. It says
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.880]   Isaiah 66, 22, "For
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   just as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.880]   endure before me, declares the Lord, so your offspring in your
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   name will endure." Right? So
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.880]   the old heavens and the old earth will be destroyed.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.880]   Right? It's no longer going to be here, and then
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   the new heaven and new earth is where we're going to be dwelling
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.880]   for eternity. Okay? So
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   obviously different people have different opinions on this,
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.880]   but basically if you follow the pattern
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.880]   of the book of Revelation, right,
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.880]   you have the tribulation. Some people have different opinions
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.880]   about when we're raptured, whether it's before or after. But you
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.880]   have the seven year tribulation where all those judgments take place.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.880]   After that, Revelation chapter 20 says
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.880]   that the millennial kingdom will come. That's where all the
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.880]   promises that He made to the nation of Israel is fulfilled.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.880]   And the genuine believers are there as co-heirs
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:51.880]   for the thousand years. And after a
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   thousand years Satan is bound, and then he will
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.880]   be released again to deceive, and then the judgment
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   comes. And then after the judgment comes, we
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.880]   enter into chapter 21. So chapter 21
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.880]   is a description of the new heavens and the new earth.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   Okay? This is the final state after all
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   of that drama, after the millennial kingdom. So new heaven
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.880]   and new earth is after the millennial kingdom,
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.880]   the final state. And He says, "Then I saw a new
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880]   heaven and a new earth." Again,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.880]   millennial kingdom is in chapter 20. Chapter 21
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.880]   is after that. Okay?
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   "Heaven at first, earth passed away, and there is no
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   longer any sea. And I saw the holy city, Jerusalem,
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   coming down out of heaven from God,
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.880]   made ready as a bride adorned for
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   her husband." So new heaven and new earth is
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   here, right? In a different form, right?
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   Heaven is not just some place up
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   in the sky where you close your eyes and you imagine this heaven. The Bible
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.880]   says that heaven is a physical place here.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:57.880]   But it's going to be in a new form, right?
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.880]   So Garden of Eden is going to be restored
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.880]   at an even better.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.880]   Okay? And the reason why it's better is because the presence of God
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.880]   and His glory is going to be, is going to
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   shine even brighter, right? And the Holy Spirit
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.880]   is going to be indwelling in us permanently.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   "And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Behold, the
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.880]   them, and He will wipe away every tear.'"
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   How much of our tears
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.880]   is because of
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.880]   heartaches that come from things that we hope
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   for here, right?
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:48.880]   Relationships, right? Jobs you didn't get,
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.880]   friendships that didn't last. How much of our tears
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   are based upon hope and
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   yearning for things that don't last, right?
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.880]   He said, "When we get to heaven," right? New heaven
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880]   and new earth, "every tear from their eyes, and there will be no
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.880]   longer be any death," because we will be in our final state.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.880]   "There will no longer be any mourning,
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   no more crying or pain.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.880]   The first things have passed away."
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:18.880]   First things referring to where we are now,
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   right? Where Adam and Eve
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.880]   brought the curse, and the curse is reversed,
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.880]   right? "He will sit on His throne
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.880]   and be said, 'Behold, I am making all things new.'"
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.880]   He said, "Right, for these
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.880]   words are faithful and true. Then He said to me, 'It is done.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.880]   I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.880]   end.'" Right? It is done.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.880]   Where else did you hear that in a different form?
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.880]   At the cross, right?
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   When Jesus says, "It is finished." So that's
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.880]   why we said that, remember we talked about the last days?
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.880]   It's oftentimes referring to
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   everything after that period when Jesus'
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.880]   death and resurrection, because everything that was needed for this
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.880]   to happen has happened. The only difference now
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.880]   is that we are in a period of grace, right?
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.880]   For evangelism, to bring other
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.880]   sinners to come to Christ, and we'll get to that next week, right?
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.880]   "I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.880]   to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   cost, He who overcomes."
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   What does it mean to "He who overcomes"?
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   Are you
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.880]   going to fight and you beat somebody? What does it mean
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.880]   "He who overcomes"?
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.880]   If our salvation, our reward
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.880]   is dependent on those who overcome,
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.880]   shouldn't you know what overcoming means?
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.880]   What does it mean to
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   overcome? And He says
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.880]   this repeatedly in Revelation to the churches,
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.880]   "He who overcomes, He who overcomes."
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.880]   "He who endures
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.880]   to the end."
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.880]   "Perseveres to the end."
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   "He who does not give up." It's not the person who starts,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.880]   it's the one who ends, right?
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.880]   So that's why the reformers came up with
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.880]   the perseverance of the saints. So the true
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.880]   assurance of
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.880]   salvation comes from perseverance of the saints.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.880]   If you really believe, you will persevere, right?
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.880]   You will inherit these things and I will be His God and He
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.880]   will be my Son. And this is the final state.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.880]   So we have one more section that's
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   kind of wrapped this up. In fact, the next passage kind of continues this thought
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:42.880]   of what person you ought to be and then He
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.880]   kind of warns them or encourages them to pay attention to
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   the Scriptures, especially Paul's writings,
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.880]   before he says his final goodbye, which will be next
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   week. So the question for discussion today
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.880]   is, what do you most look forward to
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.880]   in the new heavens and the new earth?
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.880]   When was the last time you really hoped
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.880]   for His second coming? Not just when you're
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.880]   tired or you got hurt or you felt like
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.880]   somebody disappointed you or you didn't get the job you wanted and it's like,
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   "Oh, you know, in heaven." It's almost kind of like your
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   escape, right? When things get hard here,
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.880]   you kind of want to escape and go to heaven. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.880]   daily life, right? When things
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.880]   are going well, how does
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:31.880]   the coming of Christ affect you, right?
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.880]   When your jobs are secure,
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.880]   when you have good health and your bills are paid
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.880]   and your relationships are good, how does the
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   second coming help you? This is the reason why it says it's hard for
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.880]   a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven because a rich man
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.880]   does not have external things reminding
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   him of hope that's coming because
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.880]   they're satisfied, right? So the
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   question is, if the
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.880]   whole conclusion of Peter's letter is, "What kind of person
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.880]   are you going to be considering that you
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.880]   profess to believe this?" Right?
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.880]   So what is it about the new heaven and new earth that you look
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.880]   forward to, right?
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.880]   What does hastening of the coming
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.880]   of Christ look like in your daily lives?
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.880]   What kind of actions do you take? Not just internally,
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   I'm hoping for this, but how does that affect you? And this is related to number
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.880]   three. How does looking for and hastening the coming of the
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   day of God affect the following specifically?
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.880]   Does it affect the way you spend your money?
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   There's
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.880]   two things that you can tell what people value,
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:43.880]   right? And it's 100%
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.880]   true. How you spend your money, how you spend your time.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.880]   It reveals where your value is.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.880]   So wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also, right?
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   You want to see where your heart is at?
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.880]   Go look at your budget, right?
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.880]   So how does it affect your money? How does it affect the way you
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.880]   budget? How does it affect the way you spend, right? How does
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.880]   it affect the way you give, right?
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.880]   How does end times,
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.880]   knowing that all this is going to be gone, the way you view
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.880]   your job, your career, right?
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.880]   Do you see it as a temporary thing? Like if I get a good
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   job, I get to get money. And so is it just temporal?
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.880]   Is the excitement of getting a new job your next
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.880]   paycheck or good retirement? Or is it beyond that?
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.880]   Right? Does that have eternal value, right?
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:34.880]   So how does it affect your career? The way you view relationship,
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:37.880]   both Christian and non-Christian, right?
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.880]   How does the coming of Christ and destruction of the
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.880]   old heaven and earth and new heaven and earth coming,
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   how does that affect your relationships?
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.880]   Do you have non-Christian friends that you have never
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.880]   shared the gospel with, right? If you knew that
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.880]   destruction was coming and you're a friend,
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.880]   how should that affect your relationship,
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   even for Christians, right?
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   How does hanging out with other people who believe the
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.880]   Bible, how does hanging out with other people who
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.880]   believe this, right? And if you're hanging out with
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.880]   people who profess to believe this and all you talk about
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.880]   is the next movie, next vacation, right?
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.880]   That's something we need to consider, right? How does it
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.880]   affect my relationships?
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.880]   How does it affect the way you spend your time, right?
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.880]   When you have a chunk of time, like you got a vacation
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.880]   coming up, do you automatically think,
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   "I'm going to fulfill my bucket list.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.880]   Where am I going to go? What am I going to eat? What am I going to do?"
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.880]   Is that the first and only thing that you think about?
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   How does eternal value affect even your
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.880]   leisure, right?
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.880]   I would think the more we are consumed with this
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   thought, that the more it would have a direct
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.880]   effect on every one of these things, right?
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.880]   The way you raise your children. Some of you guys
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   who are raising your children. Are we raising our children
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.880]   with eternal goals in mind or are we
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.880]   hoping that they'll get a good job,
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.880]   get married, have children,
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.880]   retire well, have a nice, peaceful
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.880]   life without turmoil? Is that the goal
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.880]   or are we really raising them with eternal things
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.880]   in mind? Are they also preparing for the end?
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.880]   Right? Alright, so I want to
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   give you guys some time to discuss these things,
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.880]   right? The hope and to hasten based upon
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.880]   the old earth and old heavens
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.880]   disappearing and new heaven and new earth coming.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.880]   Let me pray first and then I'll let you get into your small group.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:48.880]   Heavenly Father, we ask for
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.880]   your grace and your Holy Spirit to empower
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.880]   us, strengthen us, that these words
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.880]   would not fall on deaf ears.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   Help us, Lord God, to examine our own hearts,
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.880]   our own thoughts, our own lives.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.880]   That we would not be like the Pharisees
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   that just going through the motion
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.880]   and externally
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.880]   behaving in certain conduct, Lord God,
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.880]   while ignoring what may be going on
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.880]   in our own hearts. We pray,
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.880]   Father God, that hoping and hastening
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.880]   of the coming of Christ would affect
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.880]   our thoughts, our joy, our pursuit,
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.880]   our finance, our family, our leisure, our
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   goals, our hopes. That we
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.880]   would be righteous, that we would learn to be gracious
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.880]   and that we would
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.880]   truly live up to the calling that you've given us.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.880]   So I pray that you would bless this time of discussion,
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.880]   may it be fruitful and may it cause us, Lord God,
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.880]   to be sharpened. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.880]   [silence]
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:07.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
