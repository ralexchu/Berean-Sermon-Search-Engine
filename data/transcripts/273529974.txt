[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260]   Alright, so let's start.
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.760]   The Day of Atonement was a constant reminder that God is holy and that sinners and God
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.040]   cannot dwell together.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.400]   It also reminded Israelites that sin was constantly in their midst and needed constant and repeated
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   cleansing.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.080]   So, Day of Atonement was sort of like spring cleaning.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.560]   All the other days, they kind of cleaned here, cleaned the living room, cleaned the bathrooms,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.520]   but it's almost kind of like the way we had at church about a month ago.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.280]   We had everybody come together and we're just cleaning house, like from top to bottom.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.880]   So Day of Atonement was kind of like spring cleaning at the tabernacle.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.040]   But they didn't just clean the tabernacle, they cleaned all the priests, in particular
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.640]   Aaron as he was preparing for this day.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.400]   So all the sacrifices was a constant reminder to the nation of Israel that they needed to
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.360]   be atoned for in order to be in the presence of God.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.720]   But in particular, on the Day of Atonement, it was a reminder to them that even with the
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.680]   sacrifices there was this sin and uncleanness that was being piled up.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.560]   And what does it mean for the nation of Israel for sin to pile up?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.880]   How would they have understood an uncleansed and unatoned for sin in the presence of a
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.160]   holy God?
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.240]   Judgment, right?
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   So this wasn't just they needed a clean house because they wanted the tabernacle to look
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.360]   nice or to be clean.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.400]   It meant that at the Day of Atonement, it was a wrath of God that's being stored up
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.320]   against the nation of Israel had to be cleansed and wiped clean so that every year they can
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.180]   start over.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.080]   So imagine what this did, what this was supposed to do for the nation of Israel.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.200]   If you were constantly reminded that your sins needed to be atoned for and once a year
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.400]   there needed to be this massive cleaning, cleaning out of the nation of Israel, cleaning
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   out of the temple, right?
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.800]   What did that teach the nation of Israel?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.720]   If you were an Israelite living at this time, what do you think that would have taught you?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.880]   You don't need to say it.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.720]   I just want you to, I just want you to like let it digest.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.200]   Put yourself in their shoes.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.040]   What would these sacrifices have caused you to think psychologically?
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   Hmm?
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.520]   The need for a savior?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.360]   How about even before that?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.440]   That's true, but even before that?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.720]   That we're dirty, right?
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   Which led to need for a savior, which ultimately led to that.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   So an Israelite did not have to be told, they didn't have to have Bible study to tell them,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.240]   hey, all I've sinned, I fall short of the glory of God.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.560]   Let's look up the book of Romans and study how sinful we are.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   They didn't need to be taught that.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   It was part of their culture, right?
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.720]   They had to constantly be cleansed, ritually cleansed.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.800]   They had to take baths, they had to clean the garment that they were wearing, and even
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   the tabernacle where the sacrifices were being made had to be cleansed once a year to completely
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   clean it out.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.240]   Because if they didn't do that, the presence of God would destroy them.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.040]   So think about when Christ comes, that all of this is embedded in them for the purpose
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.280]   of showing them physically, you are a sinner.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.960]   There is no Israelites who could have missed that.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.200]   That you are a sinner who is constantly sinning and in constant need of saving.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.720]   So take that to the New Testament where you have the Pharisee and the tax collector who
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.120]   is coming before God praying, and the tax collector is praying, thank God I'm not like
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.760]   him.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.040]   So it kind of gives you context in how blind the Pharisees and Sadducees were.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.280]   It wasn't just like, well, I can understand why they could have missed that, but in the
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.480]   context of everything that God did with the nation of Israel, how could they have possibly
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:24.280]   missed that they were in need of a Savior, considering everything he was doing.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.080]   Leviticus 16 begins by reminding us how Aaron's sons died.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.480]   So if you remember at the very beginning, it starts off by saying, reminding us, the
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.200]   Lord spoke to Moses after the death of two sons of Aaron when they drew near before the
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.640]   Lord and died.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.400]   Now why does he begin with that?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.000]   This happened in chapter 10.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.280]   Five chapters have already gone by with all these different instructions.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.440]   Chapter 16, the Day of Atonement, begins by reminding them, remember when Aaron's sons
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.360]   Nadab and Nebu died?
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.120]   For what reason?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]   Why did they die?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.760]   Because they didn't follow instruction.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.860]   They didn't come before God with reverence.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.240]   They just considered what they were doing as common.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   They were very nonchalant in the way that they approached God.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.520]   So chapter 16 begins by warning for what purpose?
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.780]   To pay attention, right?
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.480]   Because the consequence of not paying attention and being nonchalant and irreverent toward
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.960]   these things would lead to what?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   To death.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.800]   This wasn't just a slap on the hand.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.520]   This wasn't just somebody walking around with a ruler and hitting you on the head and saying,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   "Hey, pay attention.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   This is important."
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.840]   He's saying, "Remember Aaron's son."
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.880]   These aren't just any people who came to the temple.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   The first two priests, Aaron's, the high priest's two children, they died because they didn't
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   pay attention.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.240]   So in other words, if you begin chapter 16, he's saying, "Pay attention to this because
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.280]   God is about to show up.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.080]   And if you don't follow these instructions, there's going to be dire consequences."
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.040]   So this is not a day where people were kind of jumping around and celebrating and high-fiving
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.200]   one another.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.920]   This is a day at the end.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.240]   Remember at the end of the chapter, what are the Israelites called to do?
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.480]   It is a day of what?
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.040]   Do you remember?
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.520]   At the end of the chapter, the day of atonement is called the day of...
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.560]   Starts with an A. Affliction.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.120]   So again, we'll get to that later on, but the day of atonement is called the day of
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   affliction.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.840]   And so again, even though the end result of it will lead to celebration, the day of atonement
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.680]   was meant to be a somber time, to remind them that sins needed to be atoned for.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.160]   A sinful man cannot nonchalantly enter into the presence of God.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.920]   So what we do Sundays, when we actually come into the presence of God, human beings, by
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   our natural selves, without being covered by the blood of Christ, we would be walking
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.320]   into a death sentence.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.080]   That's exactly what he's trying to teach them in chapter 16.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.080]   Without the blood of Christ, coming to God, seeking God out by our natural state, is walking
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   into a death sentence.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.720]   It's just that mankind just does not know that.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.120]   Every human being, when he dies, he's going to meet his creator.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.760]   If he is not covered by the blood of Christ, chapter 16 reminds us, he's walking into a
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.320]   death sentence.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.760]   Because sinful man, unprotected in the presence of a holy God, leads to utter destruction.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.160]   That's how chapter 16 begins.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.200]   Moses tells Aaron not to come to the holy place inside the veil or they would die.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.640]   And he repeats this several times.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640]   If you do this, you will die.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.440]   Remember when the children died.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.760]   Because God will appear to them in a cloud, it says in verse 2.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.920]   So yes, God's presence was with the nation of Israel, but on the Day of Atonement, his
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.960]   glory was unlike any other days.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.680]   He was going to appear before them.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.760]   And that's what this Day of Atonement was for.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.680]   It was to prepare for the coming of God.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.040]   So I'm just going to give you some pictures of what the tabernacle or tent of meeting
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   looked like.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   And I showed you this at the beginning of the study.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.760]   But again, you're not going to be able to see it.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.920]   But again, that's the tent of meeting.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.680]   That's the sacrifice where the horns were.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   And inside of it, I think I have the next picture, is divided into two parts.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.660]   This is actual temple, right?
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.400]   So you have the outer side, and then it's divided by the curtain in the middle.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.640]   And then on the other side, you have the Ark of the Covenant, where the mercy seat and
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.800]   all this other stuff.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.160]   So when in the middle of chapter 16, it tells them to sprinkle with blood, all of this stuff
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.080]   is taking place inside the Holy of Holies, where only Aaron was able to go in once a
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.120]   year.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:25.740]   So everything behind that curtain was never seen outside of Aaron once a year.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.940]   So this was the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.100]   And on top of that is called the mercy seat.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:40.200]   And symbolically, that's where the Messiah was supposed to come and take his seat.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.580]   And that's what the Jews understood the mercy seat to be.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.060]   So it was a place for preparation for the king to come, the Messiah to come, and take
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.460]   his throne.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.420]   The normal high priest garment would have looked like that to the right.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:03.120]   It was very colorful, had a breastplate, the umim and thumim was all part of that.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.020]   But the garment that is mentioned in this text for Aaron is very plain.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.900]   There's no color.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.500]   And we'll get to that in a minute, but the reason behind it was that this was not a day
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.420]   of celebration.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.520]   This was a day of mourning, a day of affliction.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.860]   So he was calling the nation of Israel to repentance.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:31.260]   And that's why the high priest, as he represents God to man and man to God, that he himself
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.880]   had to be humbled.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.780]   He himself had to be cleansed.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.600]   So you would think that on the day of atonement, if there was any day that he would be really
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.660]   dressed up in pomp, right?
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.820]   That he was like, "I am the high priest representing God."
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.660]   You would think that this would be the day.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.660]   Instead, on the day of atonement, when God appears, he's like any other man.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:11:01.780]   And he is humbled and he's dressed in garbs of repentance.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.220]   These are the instructions that God gave Aaron.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.780]   They had to first bring a bull for sin offering and ram for burnt offering.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:12.640]   The sin offering was given for the purpose of general cleansing, right?
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.300]   If you became unclean because you touched something holy, the sin offering was given
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.180]   for the purpose of cleansing.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.740]   Bull offering was for the purpose of atonement, the burnt offering.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.180]   So God calls for both of them.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.420]   Aaron is to put on priestly garment and tie the linen sash around his waist to prepare
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.420]   for action.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.140]   You saw the garment that he was wearing, the white, and he says to tie his sash around.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.180]   And anytime you see that language in the New Testament or the Old Testament, it basically
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.500]   meant that the priest was ready to work, right?
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.940]   So the preparation, even the garment that God told him to wear was a sign of repentance
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.280]   and mourning and affliction.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.860]   And even the way that God told him to kind of get ready to tie it around his waist was
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.420]   in preparation for what was about to happen.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.140]   Aaron is to take two male goats for sin offerings from the congregation and ram for the burnt
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.380]   offering.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:15.260]   So the two goats on the day of atonement are the primary figures.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.020]   But there were other offerings that were given.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.940]   The reason for the other offerings was for the preparation of the offering of the two
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.940]   goats.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.420]   Let me say that again, just so that you kind of get a grasp of what's happening this day.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.460]   So, when you think of the day of atonement, you probably heard about the two goats.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.780]   But it wasn't just the two goats.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.020]   There were other sacrifices being made that day.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.420]   And the reason for that was that before the two goats were sacrificed and one being released,
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.740]   there had to be preparation.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.340]   So Aaron needed to be, his sins needed to be atoned for.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:56.740]   And then the blood of the goat and the bull needed to cleanse the tabernacle itself.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:02.580]   So even before they get to this sacrifice, there needed to be cleansing.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.380]   Cleansing of the man handling all of this and cleansing of the place where this was
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.100]   going to take place.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.700]   So in other words, there's seriousness.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.180]   Every time they gave sacrifices, there was seriousness.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:22.420]   But here, everything that they handled needed to be absolutely crystal clean.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.540]   And even the sacrifices of these two goats needed to be done in a place where thorough
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.940]   cleaning already took place.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.060]   The bull is to be offered for the sin offering for Aaron himself.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.620]   So even before he gives the offering for the nation, he himself needed to be atoned for
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.100]   his own sins in order for him to even handle the offering.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.900]   He used to take the censer full of coals of fire from the altar, two handfuls of sweets
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.980]   and incense, this is straight out of the text, beaten small and bring it inside the veil
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.540]   and put it on the fire before the Lord.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.980]   So he's supposed to take the ashes from the altar outside and bring that in and begin
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.420]   to spread it and to cover the mercy seat.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.940]   All this is done to cover the mercy seat as a testimony to Aaron.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:16.340]   And all of this was so that when Aaron entered in, that he would not die.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:21.860]   And over and over again, as I mentioned, he says, this is being done so that Aaron would
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.860]   not die.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:31.860]   This is being done so that people would not die because God is about to come.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.660]   He is to take the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:48.700]   on the front of the east side seven times.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.380]   What God tells him to do, this captures the thought behind the Hebrew word for atonement,
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.140]   kippur, which means to cover.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.860]   So the word for atonement in Hebrew is kippur and the word literally means to cover.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:08.940]   So if you notice, if you read chapter 16, it says that the tabernacle needed to be atoned
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.020]   for.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.740]   So typically when we think of atonement, we think about sin, like a human sin and God
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.540]   comes and he takes away their sin.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.140]   But the word literally just means to cover, right?
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.440]   Which is interesting because in the Old Testament, the idea of atonement was simply to cover.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:32.580]   So something was filthy, so blood came and covered it to protect it from God's glory,
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.580]   right?
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.660]   The New Testament idea of atonement goes deeper than that.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.540]   The New Testament idea of atonement is that our sin is not merely covered but removed
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.420]   or taken away.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.300]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.940]   Doesn't that give us insight of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant?
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:00.140]   In the Old Covenant, the blood of the goats and animals, all they did was cover temporarily
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.180]   and they didn't have any power to actually atone for sins.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.220]   The New Testament idea of atonement was actually removal.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.180]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.300]   So in the very word for the word atonement, because when you read chapter 16, I'm hoping
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:20.780]   that you ask that question, how or why is a tabernacle need to be atoned for because
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.780]   they didn't commit any sin.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.140]   But the idea of atonement in the Old Testament is simply to cover, right?
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.540]   To be cleansed, God is coming, so everything needed to be covered by the blood.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.980]   We come to the New Testament, the blood of animals, all they could do is cover but not
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.140]   atone, mean take away sins.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.180]   I thought that was really interesting.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.820]   Then the two goats are to be taken to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and this is
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:57.380]   where the central part of the Day of Atonement takes place with these two goats.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.740]   Lots are cast to pick one goat for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel or literally
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.020]   a scapegoat.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:10.420]   So some of your translation, I think ESV just has it Azazel, right?
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.220]   What does the NASB say?
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.820]   Does the NASB use the word Azazel?
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.340]   Look at verse 8 or 10.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.340]   Huh?
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.300]   NASB just says scapegoat.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.900]   How about NIV?
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.580]   Okay, ESV has Azazel, right?
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.580]   Am I the only one?
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.660]   Because I'm not sure if I have the updated version of ESV.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.700]   It's okay, so ESV has Azazel.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.980]   So the reason why some of you have scapegoat and the ESV has Azazel is because there is
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.900]   a debate as to the meaning of this word.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.140]   Literally it means scapegoat.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:52.980]   So the NASB, NIV has translated it what that name means.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:18:00.220]   ESV kept it Azazel because there is a discussion that it might be a name of a demon, which
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.220]   I'm going to get to in a little bit.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.420]   I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.220]   I remember the first time I went through this, we talked about this in detail, but I think
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.540]   maybe two of you were here during that time, so you might not remember, okay?
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.420]   But I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.340]   But the word Azazel, or literally a scapegoat, was the other one.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:25.860]   The one that the Lot fell for the Lord's use is to be offered as a sin offering.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:35.780]   So among the two, they drew lots and the one was to be sacrificed and killed.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.940]   And with the blood of the goat, he is to bring it into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.980]   on the mercy seat.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:47.940]   So the sacrificed animal that was given to the Lord was brought in and the mercy seat
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:53.200]   was cleansed or covered through its blood.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.340]   And then after exiting the Holy of Holies, Aaron is to take some of the blood of the
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.880]   bull and some of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.740]   And this is outside.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:11.060]   So first he covers the mercy seat and then he comes and he sprinkles it on the altar,
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.740]   all the sacrifices taking place.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:19.020]   So again, all of the blood and all of the sprinkling was meant to make it holy, to cleanse,
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.020]   right?
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:26.060]   So it was like an annual spring cleaning that's taking place with the blood.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.220]   Aaron is then commanded to sprinkle some of it with his fingers seven times to clean and
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.520]   consecrate it from the uncleanness of the people of Israel.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.820]   What made the tabernacle unclean?
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.380]   People.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.420]   It wasn't the dirt.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420]   It wasn't the animals.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.220]   It wasn't, you know, I mean think about how many sacrifices were being given.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.420]   The mercy seat was never touched because nobody ever goes in there, right?
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.620]   So it wasn't because it was dirty.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.740]   It wasn't because it was touched.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.260]   It wasn't the dirt on the human hands.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.960]   It was man's sin.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:11.820]   And from God's perspective, the filth of man's sin was constantly piling up.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.660]   And even in their sacrifices, it wasn't enough.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.060]   So once a year, the sins that were piled up, he would come and he said, "In order for me
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.900]   to come, you need to clean the house."
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:28.500]   So again, the reason why the tabernacle needed to be cleansed was the presence of man.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   It wasn't the goat.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.360]   It wasn't the dirt, right?
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.060]   It was sinfulness of men.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.700]   And I think if you've read Holiness of God, R.C.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.780]   Sproul does a great job explaining, right, that everything else in the universe abides
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.620]   by God, but the only hands that rebel, only creation that rebels against God is mankind,
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.100]   right?
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.060]   Everything else in the universe does exactly what God tells us to do.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.140]   Only mankind rebels against God, right?
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.700]   So it was man's dirty hands.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.220]   It was man's dirty presence that needed to be cleansed from the tabernacle.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:08.780]   And so that's what the Day of Atonement was teaching them.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:14.340]   The other goat for Azazel is to be used to make atonement for Israel and be sent away
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.180]   into the wilderness to Zezel.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:26.740]   Literally the word means "escape goat" or "scapegoat."
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.940]   Aaron is told to lay both his hands on the head of the goat to represent the sins of
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.460]   Israel and confess over it the iniquities of the people of Israel.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:41.660]   So the act was that he would lay both of his hands and by doing so it represented that
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:51.460]   all of the sins of Israel was being laid upon this scapegoat or Azazel.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:57.300]   So the goat, the scapegoat or Azazel that bears the sins of Israel then will be sent
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.860]   away into the remote wilderness to Azazel.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.500]   Let me just briefly touch upon this.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.860]   The meaning of the word Azazel is not certain.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:17.340]   The word may signify a removal or dismissal.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:24.860]   Some believe there were elaborate Jewish traditions saying that he was a demonic being that the
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.380]   Messiah would defeat.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.900]   Azazel may simply be referring to this goat's function of symbolically removing sin from
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.900]   Israel.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:38.860]   So basically some Jewish tradition pointed to the fact that Azazel was a demonic figure
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.420]   that one was given to the Lord and the other was given to the demons.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.780]   And again, depending on which commentary you read, you'll get different stories.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:54.780]   So the fact that ESV left the word Azazel may mean that the interpreters kind of leaned
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.020]   toward possibly being a demon.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.780]   So this is not some weird view, right?
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.820]   Even though it may have been the first time for you to have heard it, in fact it is more
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.820]   common than you think.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.000]   It is not the most popular view.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.460]   The most popular view is that the word Azazel simply just means it's a description of
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.920]   the function of that goat, right?
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:24.760]   But there are legitimate scholars in legitimate theological schools that believe that it was
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.020]   a name of a demon.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:32.020]   So one was given to the Lord and the sin of the nation of Israel was given to the rightful
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.020]   owner, okay?
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.660]   Which kind of correlates to the New Testament when Paul says that the God of this age is
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.720]   Satan, right?
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.380]   And that his dominion is over all who sin.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.020]   And so when the scripture talks about how he delivers us, he transfers us from what?
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.820]   The dominion of darkness into his son's kingdom.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.780]   So that imagery is not new, right?
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.900]   We see that in the New Testament.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.440]   If that is true or not, it really doesn't change anything, right?
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.300]   Whether Azazel simply is talking about the scapegoat or whether it's talking about a
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:15.040]   demonic figure who has dominion over all that sin, all that is sinful, either way the meaning
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.240]   behind the scapegoat or Azazel is that this sin, the sins of Israel is taken away and
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.120]   cast out because of the sacrifice of the other goat, right?
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.920]   That's where we get the term, at least in English, the scapegoat comes from.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's specifically from this.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.440]   So imagine every single year, right, the nation of Israel was gathered together at the tabernacle
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.980]   watching this ceremony, right?
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.980]   Two goats are chosen.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:51.520]   So after they do thorough cleansing, Aaron takes a bath and he puts on the garment that
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.400]   typically he's probably seen with this really gaudy garment, but on that day of atonement
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:03.800]   he wears a very humbled garment and then he goes in, he makes sacrifice, he takes a bath,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.440]   he goes in and cleanses the inner sanctuary, comes back out and he cleanses the outside
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.160]   and then he takes these two goats and it's this whole drama of drawing the lot, you know,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.080]   and then one goat is sacrificed and then its blood comes and takes it out and then the
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.880]   other one he lays his hand and then a man is chosen to take this goat and travel far
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.880]   distance.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:33.560]   In fact, it's not in the scripture but Jewish tradition says that a man took the goat about
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:39.360]   ten miles away from the camp and then the goat was released to wander off until it could
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.280]   not be seen anymore.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.840]   This signified that the sin of Israel was gone and the day of atonement was considered
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.920]   complete.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.960]   Whatever the meaning of Azazel is, the picture is pretty clear.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.200]   Because of the sacrifice of one, the sins of Israel will be taken away.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   I mean, how could that not be pointing to Christ?
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.720]   And this was embedded into their culture year after year, this drama.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.480]   It wasn't just taught, it wasn't just said, this was something that they saw every single
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   year.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.440]   One, that we are sinners.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:24.040]   There's no Israelite, no Israelite should have been confused about their sin.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.600]   I mean, it was pounded into them.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   You will die.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:36.240]   Aaron, supposedly the holiest man of Israel, as a high priest, at least on paper, he said
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   he's going to die.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.960]   If his sins aren't atoned for, when God comes, he's going to die.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.880]   If he enters into the inner sanctuary, he's going to die.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.680]   If he makes sacrifices, he's going to die.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.720]   If he doesn't follow instructions, he's going to die.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:58.560]   If they were that vulnerable to the holiness of God, what about the rest of Israel?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.240]   So imagine this drama being played out year after year, which is embedded in them, all
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.440]   for the purpose of preparation for the coming of Christ.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:14.280]   So the fact that they missed him, despite all of this, it kind of gives us a different
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:21.840]   picture of just the blindness, just how blind they were.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:29.720]   Aaron, after it is all done, re-enters into the camp, right?
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   And then he couldn't just re-enter.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.360]   He had to take a bath again and go through the cleansing.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.460]   And the one who actually handed the goat, Azazel, who took him out, in order for him
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.840]   to return, he also had to go through ritual cleansing.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.580]   And then all the meat and everything else that was sacrificed had to be taken outside
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.960]   the camp and basically burned outside the camp.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.160]   I didn't mention it here, but the guy who took it out also had to go through ritual
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.080]   cleansing to enter back into camp.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.880]   So every aspect of the Day of Atonement was, God is coming.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:15.200]   If there's any kind of uncleanness of any kind, you're going to die.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.240]   That was the message given on the Day of Atonement.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.200]   So that's why it was called the Day of Affliction.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.040]   It was when God came to afflict.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:34.360]   So the last part of it, chapter 29 to 34, again, it says that this day was given as
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.560]   a day of affliction.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:43.060]   And then it says in verse 30, "It is a day to be cleansed for all their sins."
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:49.140]   And then he calls it, in verse 31, "It is a Sabbath of solemn rest."
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.580]   Which is interesting because I would think that if there was any day that they would
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:59.420]   have not rested, it would have been this particular day.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.100]   He mentions over and over again that if there's any sin in you, you will die.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.780]   If you don't cleanse, you will die.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.300]   If you don't cover yourself, you will die.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:15.820]   And yet, this day of Sabbath is called a solemn day of rest.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:21.740]   In the Scriptures, the Sabbath always looked back.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.920]   So the Jews understood the Sabbath was what was lost at the creation.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.660]   When Adam and Eve, when God entered His rest on the seventh day, when Adam and Eve sinned,
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.820]   that Sabbath was broken.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:39.620]   So every Sabbath was a reminder to them that that's what they lost.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.820]   The rest that they can only find in God was lost.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.460]   But it also points to the future, that the Messiah was going to come and He was going
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.540]   to restore this Sabbath.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:57.500]   So again, when Jesus says, "All who are weary, I will give you this rest.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.620]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.420]   A Jew would have understood that very differently.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.580]   It would have had a lot more meaning than just, "I get to go home and relax."
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.940]   Because Sabbath was what they understood.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.740]   Sabbath was what was lost in creation when they sinned.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.820]   And then it was Sabbath that was to be restored.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:24.860]   So this day of atonement is called the Sabbath of solemn rest, was to point back and to point
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.260]   forward for the coming of Messiah.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:32.860]   And every year when they did this was for that purpose.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:39.300]   You see how this day was so significant and now every detail of it was for the purpose
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.620]   of preparing for the gospel.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.340]   The gospel makes so much more sense.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:50.220]   It becomes so much more richer when you understand Leviticus, and especially chapter 16, where
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:55.020]   Christ was sacrificed in order that you and I could be set free.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:00.540]   I want you to read Hebrews chapter 9.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.500]   I'm just going to read this with you.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:09.900]   Chapter 9, 11 to 28, because the author of Hebrews reminds us that Christ fulfilled this
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   day.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.940]   "But when Christ appeared as high priest of the good things that have come, then through
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.260]   the greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands that is not of the creation, he
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.460]   entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of blood of goats and calves,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.380]   but by means of his own blood."
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.140]   So clearly this is talking about the day of atonement.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.180]   All the other priests who came before him had to do this repeatedly and he had to be
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.180]   cleansed to get in.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:41.340]   But he goes into the real tent by his own blood, securing eternal redemption.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.100]   So the day of atonement wasn't done once.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.420]   It had to be done every single year because it wasn't enough.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.420]   It was just a foreshadowing of what was to come.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.860]   When Christ came, the redemption was real and it was permanent.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.620]   "For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.420]   the ashes of high first sanctifies for the purification of the flesh."
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.420]   Stop right there.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.860]   So again, this is all pointing to chapter 16.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.740]   "How much more would the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:14.740]   without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:21.140]   If all of this ritual was for the purpose of cleansing and all of it was simply a shadow,
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.740]   how much more when Christ comes and he does this with his own blood?
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.460]   "Therefore, not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.280]   For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people,
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.880]   he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.900]   both the book itself and all the people, saying, 'This is the blood of the covenant that God
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.460]   commanded for you.'
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.180]   But in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.180]   in worship.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.820]   Indeed, under the law, almost everything is purified with blood, and without shedding
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.940]   of blood there is no forgiveness of sins."
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.540]   And this is again, this is embedded in the culture of Israel, and in particular the Day
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.540]   of Atonement.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.540]   "Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.480]   rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.000]   For Christ has entered not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.660]   things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.300]   Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly as the high priest enters the holy places every
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.980]   year with blood not his own.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.180]   For then we would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.280]   But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of ages to put away sin by the
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.500]   sacrifice of himself.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.060]   And just as it is appointed for man to die once, after that comes judgment.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.660]   For Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time,
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.660]   not to deal with sin, but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him."
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.260]   All of this, right?
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:56.780]   All of this is pointing back to chapter 16, that Jesus Christ was fulfilling this.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:02.020]   So all of this drama was to point to the fact that Jesus, the real high priest, the real
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:08.300]   sacrifice was going to atone in the real tabernacle of heaven.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.560]   And so our sins have been redeemed as a result of what he has done.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.100]   So the first time he came, he came to deal with sin.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.620]   He says the second time he comes, he comes to redeem.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:26.940]   And so all those who believe this, who genuinely believe that this happened to me, that Jesus
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.060]   covered my blood, and that's why it says, what does it say?
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.300]   All who are eagerly waiting for him.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.900]   Only those who believe that this happened for him would be eagerly waiting for that
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   redemption.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.980]   And that's why the Holy Spirit is called what?
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.900]   A deposit.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.620]   You put a deposit because the owner, the person who put a deposit is going to later on come
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.620]   to claim what is his.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:58.500]   Only those who believe this, now you can confess it, you can come to church and you can go
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:04.780]   through all the motions, but only the ones who really believe that this is his will be
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.740]   eagerly waiting for him, right?
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.980]   Because our salvation is not complete until he comes.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.140]   We only have the deposit of what he has done.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.540]   So everything that we are doing now is just a taste.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.000]   The reality of redemption is going to come when he comes.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.260]   So a man or a woman who makes this their home can confess that they believe this, but by
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.780]   their action, they do not.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:39.660]   And that's why it says repeatedly over and over again, those who eagerly wait for him.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.640]   Because with him comes redemption, right?
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.940]   This is what was embedded in the nation of Israel year after year after year after year,
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.340]   right?
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.380]   I don't know about you, but it just makes the gospel that much richer.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.460]   It didn't just come randomly.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.900]   That God has been preparing not only Israel, but us, that all of this so that we can have
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.420]   this understanding, right?
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.060]   This drama would give us a picture of what he has done.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.940]   So when Paul says, "In view of this mercy, to give your life as a living sacrifice,"
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.340]   like all of this comes into play for a Jew, right?
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.720]   So three questions.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.600]   Why do you think some people have a hard time accepting God's forgiveness for their sins?
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.340]   How does a difficult time accepting God's forgiveness affect our worship and life in
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340]   general?
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340]   That's pretty straightforward.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.460]   What is the worst sin you have been forgiven for?
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.740]   So I'm not asking you to actually confess, right?
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.300]   I'm just asking you, if you can think of it, what it is.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.060]   You don't have to share with the group, but how did that affect the way you gave worship
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.060]   to God?
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:54.180]   So in your mind, do you remember a time when you were really weighed down by the guilt
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:01.060]   of your sin, and when God forgave you, when you repented and you felt forgiveness for
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.580]   that sin, how did that affect you?
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.100]   How did that affect worship?
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.100]   How did that affect fellowship?
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.420]   So I'm asking you to share that, even if you don't want to share the details of that sin,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.840]   but if you can remember what you felt like when you were delivered and forgiven.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.560]   In what way does our sin affect the church?
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.260]   So the whole drama of the tabernacle on the cleansing, it wasn't just an individual sin.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.580]   The tabernacle needed to be cleansed.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.380]   The sin, it wasn't just the sin of the individual, the sin of Israel had to be taken out, right?
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.460]   Away from the camp.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:39.500]   So sin, at least the way God describes it for us, is not simply personal, it is collective.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.400]   Our sins affect the community.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.680]   Sins of other people affect the community, right?
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.460]   And that's exactly what it says in 1 Corinthians 3, 16, right?
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.900]   We are the temple of God, right?
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.900]   Collectively.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.320]   In what way does our sin affect the church?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.920]   What prescriptions are given for cleansing of impurity when it comes to corporate body?
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.400]   And use specific verses, right?
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   If you can, if it's relevant.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:10.240]   Alright, let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into your smoke.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.160]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.780]   For there's so much more to our salvation than we even know now.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:28.720]   And the more we open your word, we understand the depth of what you have done and what you
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.160]   are continuing to do.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.480]   And we know even now, Lord God, we're only scratching the surface.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.760]   Help us, Lord God, to be eager to know.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:45.400]   Lord, this foolish world that we live in, the more we experience it, the more we are
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   disappointed.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:53.040]   But yet, Lord God, we dig into your word, your living word.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   There's so much, Lord God, of your grace and your love and your mercy and just how deep
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.940]   it goes.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.640]   Help us to be a church, Lord God, that really loves you.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:09.980]   That we will not be satisfied with superficial, elementary understanding of our faith.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:16.380]   But help us to dig, not simply for knowledge's sake, but so that we can understand you, your
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.840]   heart and what you have done.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.260]   That all that we do may simply be a reasonable response.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.180]   Bless the time that we have in our small group, Lord.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
