[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   attention on this particular passage this morning.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We're not going to be on this passage, I'm just going to be reading this as an opening.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   But Luke chapter 17
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and verse 11
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   through 19.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Luke chapter 17
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   verse 11 through 19. "On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   and as he entered a village he was met by ten lepers who stood at a
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   distance and lifted up their voices saying, 'Jesus, Master, have mercy
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   on us.' When he saw them he said to them, 'Go and show yourself to the
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   priests.' And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. And he
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Then Jesus answered, 'We're not ten cleansed, we are the nine.'
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?'
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And he said to him, 'Rise and go your way, your faith has made you well.'"
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We thank you for the body of Christ that you have placed us in
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   that we may grow, keep each other accountable, to find
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   encouragement and strength, and to be able to worship and run this race together.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I pray, Father God, that the truth of your grace would
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   always sustain, strengthen, and encourage and feed us.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   We pray this morning, Lord, as we search your word to know what it means to be
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   thankful. Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon you,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   that all that we glean from your word would be yours and not mine.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So we entrust this time to you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Obviously this Thursday is Thanksgiving, I'm sure you are
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   aware of it. Either some of you guys are going out of town to visit your family or
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   family is coming in. And so I'm sure we're all aware
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   of it, but every year it seems like this holiday is
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   diminishing more and more. In fact, even the term Thanksgiving, I just
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   don't hear it much. I hear Black Friday and what kind of
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   deals are going to be on Cyber Monday. And some of you guys
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   probably already scoped all that out. I don't know if people stand in front
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   of stores anymore, because Cyber Monday, you can get it online. But it seems
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   like Thanksgiving is almost, just kind of gradually disappearing.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And now we just want to skip to Christmas.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Thanksgiving, not just because it's Thanksgiving, but for Christians
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   is absolutely essential. Not only, again,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   as I said, not only is it because Thanksgiving is coming up, but I want
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   to search through the Scriptures this morning and look at four principles,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   four things that the Bible teaches about why Thanksgiving
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   is essential in the Christian life. That a Christian that is
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   not thankful is an oxymoron. It is something that
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   has at the core something has deeply gone
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   wrong if a Christian and Thanksgiving are
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   those two terms don't go hand in hand. So, what I want to do is look at
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   four separate things that the Bible teaches. Again, today is a topical sermon
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   on this subject, and then we'll jump back into Romans next week.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The first thing that we see in Luke chapter 17, 11-19,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   the passage that we just read, I think most of you
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   are probably familiar with this story. You had the ten
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   lepers. And again, those of you guys who know
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   about what it was like to be a leper at that time, that you were labeled
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   not only physically unclean, but spiritually unclean. So, it was required
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   by the Mosaic Law to keep a certain distance. One, for health
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   reasons, because they didn't want other people to get infected. But also for spiritual reasons.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   They felt that they were an outcast. They had to live
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   outside the gate. And so everywhere they went they had to actually scream out,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   "Unclean! Unclean!" so that they don't make anybody unclean by being
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   near the region. And this is the reason why when they hear
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   about Jesus that they from a distance are yelling out to Jesus,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "Have mercy on us! Have mercy on us!" By the time that Luke
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   writes Luke chapter 17, Jesus' fame has already spread. He's already
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   performed many miracles. So, if these lepers had any chance of
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   getting healed, it's to get Jesus' attention.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So, the passage that we look at they cry out to Him, Jesus has mercy on
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   them. And so He tells them to go show yourself to the priests.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And the reason why He tells them to do that, by Mosaic Law, if
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   a healing takes place, by whatever means,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   if the leprosy does get cleansed, the first person that needed
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   to acknowledge that was the priest. Because they were the guardians of the temple.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And the religious community. So, the priest basically
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   had to do a thorough examination. And then they had to go through a cleansing ritual.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And then they would declare Him clean. And so to be declared
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   clean by the priest basically meant not only were you physically clean, but
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   you're able to now enter back into society. That you don't need to live outside
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   the camp. You can go back home, or wherever your home may be.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So, that's why Jesus is saying that go show
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   yourself to the priest. And the story goes that on the way that they are going there
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the miracle takes place and they get cleansed.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But the point of this story is not simply about their miracle. Because
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   out of the ten it says that only one of them when they
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   recognized that they were clean, they turned around to go give
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   thanks to Jesus. And it is pointed out that
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   this man was a Samaritan. Not the nine Jews who were privileged
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   by His law and His presence and God's protection upon them, but
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   the Samaritan who was outside of the blessing of the nation
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   of Israel. That He's the one of all people that returns to give thanks.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But here's the part I want you to pay attention to. Starting from verse 17.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Jesus answered him, "Were not ten cleansed?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   except this foreigner?" And he said to him, "Rise and go your way.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Your faith has made you well." Let me stop right there.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   What does Jesus mean when He says your faith has made you well?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   They all got cleansed. All ten of them got
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   cleansed. But yet He singles out this one man and says your faith
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   is different than the others. And the distinction was that He was the only
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   one who returned and recognized the healer which was Jesus.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So when He says your faith has made you well
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   there is a distinction between His wellness and the other nine.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Clearly He's making a distinction because He's separating His faith
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   versus the others. When we take a closer examination
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   on the meaning of the word that He uses for well, here's
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   other ways that this word, "sodzo" is the Greek word
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   that is translated for well. This is how it's translated in other passages.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   To deliver. To make whole. Sorry.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   To make whole. To preserve safe from
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   danger, loss, destruction, or to save.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   If you look at the context
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   of how this passage really ought to be understood. Because
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   He can't be simply talking about physical healing because they were all physically
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   healed. So when He says your faith has made you well
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He seems to be talking about an
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   inner healing. A spiritual healing. In other words, out of
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   the ten who were saved, only one was saved. Only one.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And the distinction between the nine and the one
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   is that one returned to give thanks.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Now, you may look at that and say, well, that seems like a harsh
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   line to draw just because one recognized and he returned to give thanks and the other nine
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   did not and they went out celebrating and forgot about Jesus.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   But when you look at the context of the scripture and in the Bible
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and specifically in the book of Romans, how man's rebellion is
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   described. I think it will make better sense to us what Jesus was saying here.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   In Romans chapter 121, it says, "For although they knew God, they did not
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   honor Him as God or give thanks to Him, but they became futile in
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   You see how Paul describes the rebellion of man? That they would not
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   recognize God and give honor to Him or give thanks
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   to Him. And in Romans chapter 121 it pretty much
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   summarizes the sin of mankind. That His
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   desire is to elevate Himself
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   rather than God. And to give thanks to
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Him. The first principle that I want us
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   to recognize is thanksgiving is an essential part of our salvation.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Thanksgiving is the essential part of our salvation.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It is what identifies a Christian and a non-Christian. At least that's how the Bible
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   describes it. The Bible describes a Christian as one who recognizes
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   God and gives honor and is thankful to Him. A non-Christian is one who
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   does not recognize Him, does not give honor and glory to Him.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So again to put it in a neat package basically a Christian is
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   identified by his thankfulness.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You know years ago I remember reading a story, the testimony of
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Pastor Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel and it really stuck with me.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And I remember he said that in the beginning of the Church
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   that the Church was beginning to thrive and they decided to buy this Church property
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   because of the growing number of people coming. And they got
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   into a mortgage situation and the payment for the mortgage was coming up and they were
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   short of the money. So he began to pray before God that the Lord would
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   provide for these things. And one day he said he got a phone call
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   from an individual promising Chuck Smith the
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   exact amount that he needed for the payment. And so in his
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   testimony he gives how elated he was that that person somehow miraculously
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   God would convict him to give him the exact amount of money that he needed
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   to pay off this bill. And in the midst of his celebration
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   he took a step back and realized that his celebration
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   was off base. And the reason why he says that is
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   because he found more comfort in the promise of that man
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   than in God's promises. And in his testimony he shares
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   how in his own heart God revealed how closely
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   he was dependent upon man's promises. See he still didn't have the cash.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That man did not give the money. The money was not in the
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   bank. But because the man promised that I'm going to give you
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   sometime in the future if you need it I'm going to give it to you. That he felt more peace with that
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   than his ability to come before the Lord in prayer.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   See at the core of man's rebellion against God is a refusal
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   to acknowledge our Sovereign God.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   See in 1 Peter 1 24-25 it says,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory, like the flower of the
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   grass, will wither, and the flower will fail.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   But the word of the Lord remains forever, and the
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   word is the good news that was preached to you."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You know if anything the longer I live the more I am
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   absolutely certain that nothing is for certain.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   If that makes any sense.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Like everything, family, friendships,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   organizations, even churches they come and they go.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Anything that you have confidence in whether it's finances or works
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   things that you think are going to be permanent for the rest of your life is never
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   really permanent. Just like Peter says in this passage,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "All flesh, all flesh." He's not just talking about flesh or
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   physical flesh even though obviously that's a big part of it. Everything that is
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   physical, everything that you can sense with your senses
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   will eventually fade. The only thing that lasts forever is His Word.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   See the rebellion of mankind
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   where He says, "We chose not to give glory to the Creator
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   rather we created things and gave glory to the image that
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   we created for ourselves." That's at the core of human rebellion.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Not recognizing God as God.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I remember years ago
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I was a part of this ministry back in college and that ministry happened to be thriving.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I wasn't leading it I was just a member. But it happened to be thriving and I remember
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   a friend of mine who was also a Bible major at that time wanted to have
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   lunch with me because he wanted to ask about that ministry.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And so he's a pastor so he wanted to know what we're doing and how the ministry
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   is being fruitful so that it can be applied in his ministry. And I remember having lunch with him
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   and he asked me, "Peter what are you guys doing that seem to be working?"
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And I said, "You know I can't pinpoint any one particular thing
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   because I see this system in a lot of places."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   But I can tell you again this is just from my observation
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   what I see a difference between these guys and what I've experienced
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   previously. These guys actually practice what they preach.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And he said, "What do you mean?" Well they actually pray.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   They actually witness. They actually
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   read the Bible and memorize scripture and they actually do these things.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   They don't just talk about it. And I remember telling him, "If you're asking me
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   what I'm observing that is different is that's what's different.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   They're actually practicing and doing these things. They're not just talking. It's not just a doctrinal statement
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   that they have. It's not just on paper." And I remember his response to me was
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   "Peter, I'm a pastor. You're a Bible major. I'm a Bible major. We know this
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   but what is working? Like what is working?"
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And I said, "Well I can tell you what they're doing but I see the same thing in other
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   churches that aren't working. So if you're asking for a system I can
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   tell you what they're doing but I don't really think that's the thing because I was a part
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   of another ministry who practiced the exact same thing and it wasn't working."
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   But he just could not get over it. He's like, "Peter, if you don't want to share just don't
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   share, okay?" But I remember coming out of that so frustrated
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   because at the core of who we are, even when the
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   churches grow, we automatically have a
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   tendency to see, well what system? What system is working?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Who's doing it? And that's what we want to practice.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   That's what we want to copy. So you have a church that grows. Everybody's going over there and it's like
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   oh that's how they're organized. That's how they do this. That's how they do that. And then they just kind of package
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   that and then try to recreate that in other places. At the core of that
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   at the core of that, aren't we giving
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   credit to creation rather than the Creator? Of course we acknowledge God.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   We sing songs. We have doctrinal stuff. Of course we read the Bible but what are you doing
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   really? Right? See there's a reason
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   why in everything that God has done in the Old Testament and New Testament
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   He goes exactly against the wisdom of man. Because if God
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   is seeking His glory, one, He's not going to use people who are going to
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   be in the middle and say, "I did it." He's not going to place
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   people in positions when things happen and they bare fruit, "Oh because that guy was smart."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Or "It's because he was organized this way." And then we end up giving credit
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   to other things rather than God. Okay we give some credit to God but it has to be
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   some other system. Some other things that are going on. There's a reason why He
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   uses uneducated people. Why He chooses the worst of sinners.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Because ultimately it's to take our eyes off of creation
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and to look at the Creator. Because if at the core
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   of man's sin and core of his rebellion is a refusal to honor
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   God and to give thanks to Him, isn't that what He
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   is pursuing? Isn't that why He saves
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   us? So that we can recognize who He is? Isn't that what repentance is?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Repentance isn't simply, "You know I lied the other day
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   so I repent of that. You know I lost it in my heart, I repent
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   it of that." Justification happens not because you recognize
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   certain sins in your life. A particular sin in your life.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Justification, salvation happens when we recognize our whole
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   trajectory of life was wrong. Even when we did
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   good, it was for my glory. Even when we feed the poor.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Even when we love our families, it was for me. So it wasn't
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   just about one particular thing or several particular things. It's about
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   who I was that I repent of. See
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I gave glory to creation rather than the Creator.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So the first principle that we see,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   thanksgiving is an essential part of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   That's the identifying mark of a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Everything else, like grass, withers.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Second principle that we see is that the opposite
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   of thanksgiving, we often see it in bitterness and grumbling.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   You know what is the opposite of thanksgiving?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Non-thanksgiving. Yes, that's not opposite.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Typically what squashes a thankful heart is bitterness
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and grumbling. Hebrews chapter 12 verse 15, "See to it
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   that no one fails to obtain the grace of God, that no root of bitterness
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   defiled." We see over and over again in
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Israel's history that what kept tripping them up
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   despite all the privileges that they had, despite everything that
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   the miracles that they provided, that God shown them, and the
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   victories that they were able to experience by the power of God, despite all of that,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   what kept tripping them up? Well, 1 Corinthians 10, 9-10
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   it says, "We must not put Christ to the test as some of them did," them talking
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   about the Israelites, "and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   as some of them did and were destroyed by the destroyer."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   The reason why they were grumbling is because they didn't believe in God.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And at the end of the day,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   that's how God describes grumbling. It's because you didn't trust me.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   You looked at your circumstance and you trusted it rather than me.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   See, grumbling in the Israelites,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I mean when we look at it, you know, a lot of times you read the Old Testament and people
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   say, "Oh, God is so harsh and He's so judgmental." Right?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Until you understand the context, go read the Old Testament carefully,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   especially the history of Israel. See if God comes out
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   seeking or seeming vengeful.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   He does not. If anything, you probably
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   my guess is you'll be thinking the same thing I'm thinking.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Why do these people still exist? Right?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Why does a holy God put up with these people? That's probably what's going to enter your mind if you read it
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   consistently. The whole nation of Israel begins
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   because they become slaves in Egypt.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And obviously they're coming and crying out before God because they're
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   being mistreated. They're in agony. They can't raise
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   their children and they're back breaking work from sunup to sundown.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   And they're crying out to God. God says He hears their suffering
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   and He has compassion on them. So He raises a servant, Moses,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   and He tells them to go, "Let my people go that they may come out and worship me."
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   So the whole reason why the nation of Israel even existed, why they even
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   started, because He had compassion. He heard their prayer.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   But as soon, as soon as they come into some trouble,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   the grumbling begins. In Exodus chapter 14,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   11-12, as they're escaping, they're at the Red Sea
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   and they can't cross. The Egyptian army is
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   coming and they look, they think that they're going to get wiped out. So the
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   grumbling begins. Exodus 14, 11. They said to Moses,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   in the wilderness?" Dramatic. "What have you done
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   to us in bringing us out of Egypt? Is it not this
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   what we said to you in Egypt? Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   for it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Have you ever read the Old Testament? Did you ever hear that before?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   If they did say it they must have been murmuring it, because
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   it's not mentioned. All I know is that when
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   what I read is when God shows up and He delivers a miraculously,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   there is a celebration going on. Right? There is a parade going on. They are marching
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   out, "Yes, we are no longer slaves." Right? That's the last
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   scene that we see until they get to the Red Sea. And as soon as they see the Red Sea
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and they see the army coming, they are like, "Why did you bring us out here?
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It wasn't that bad in Egypt.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Why did you just let us die over there and just bring us out here?"
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   It doesn't stop there. God performs a miracle. He opens
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   up the Red Sea. They are able to cross and God delivers them. And then
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   praise God. We have an awesome God. And then they walk
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   onto the desert. Water. Water.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   As soon as they get a little bit thirsty they start grumbling about water. Exodus chapter
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   15, 23. When they came to Marah they could not drink the water
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   of Marah because it was bitter. Therefore it was named Marah. And the people
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   of Israel grumbled against Moses saying, "What shall we drink?"
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And they started complaining about not having enough water.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   "Why did you deliver us from Egypt? They had water there."
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   It doesn't stop there. And then they get a little bit hungry. Food.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Exodus chapter 16, 2. And the whole congregation of the people of Israel
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. And the people of Israel said to them,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   "Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   We sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full. For you have brought us
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So it wasn't, if it wasn't for danger, if it wasn't for water, now
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   it's food. And then God gives them manna.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And so they eat a little bit of manna. And now they are sick and tired of manna.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So they start complaining about the type of food. Numbers chapter 11, 4-5.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   also wept again and said, "Oh that we had meat to eat.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   We remember the fish we ate in Egypt and cost nothing. The cucumbers,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   the melons, the leeks, the onions and the garlic. But now our strength is
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   dried up and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at."
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   I mean if it wasn't one thing, it was another thing.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And they said, "Well when are we going to get to the promised land?"
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   And then they finally get to the promised land in Numbers chapter 14, 2-4. They started
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   grumbling about the promised land.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   They said, "Well we need leaders." So God established Moses in Exodus chapter 17.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   They start grumbling about the leaders. And then ultimately
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   in Exodus chapter 16 and 8, God
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   says through Moses, "You are not grumbling against my leaders.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   You are ultimately grumbling against me." Exodus 16-8.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Moses said, "This will happen when the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening and bread
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   to the full in the morning. For the Lord hears your grumblings which you grumble
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   are not against us but against the Lord."
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   See the opposite of thanksgiving is grumbling.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's bitterness. Because we don't recognize
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   His hand. See a grumbling heart will always find
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   something to grumble about.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Before we take a step back and say, "Wow, these Israelites, you know,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   if I was in that situation, if I went through the Red Sea, if I had manna, I would not have been
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   that way." You know, we automatically think, "Oh, those people."
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Right? "Those people. If I was there, if I saw Jesus
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   walking on water, you know, I would have believed and I would have done all of this
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and that." But don't you see ourselves
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   in a nation of Israel? There is a reason why they are given to us as an example
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   in 1 Corinthians 10. See they served as an example. They all
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   saw the miracles. They all ate the manna. They all were delivered through
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   the clouds. But only a few of them returned and
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   gave thanks.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Look at ourselves. I mean, we're...think about
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   the blessing that we have in Christ.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Christians in the United States of America.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   We say, "Oh, don't say Merry Christmas
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   in Target." How dare you!
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   You know, our rights are being taken away. Injustice.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Now I know what the Middle East and Christians are going through.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Because that's where we are.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   We are so privileged with everything that we can possibly desire.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And when something doesn't go quite right, grumbling happens.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And if you really think about it, what is the root of grumbling and bitterness?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   If you think about if the root of
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   rebellion against God is basically saying, "I do not honor you. I don't give thanks to you."
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   You're not acknowledging God. The root of rebellion in our
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   hearts of bitterness and unthankfulness is not recognizing
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Him. There is a turmoil, a fight going on
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   in our inner being to establish what I think is right above
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   what is. If we believe that God is sovereign,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   that God is the one who is in control.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   But where does bitterness come from? Where does grumbling come from? I think this is
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   where it needs to be, but this is where it is.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   So the grumbling happens because I'm telling God
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   what I think needs to be. And when God
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   refuses to submit to my ideas,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   to my understanding of what is good and right, that's where grumbling
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and bitterness comes from. Because I ultimately, I'm not grumbling
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   against objects. I'm grumbling against the one who
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   has the control to do anything about it. So if we're grumbling, just like
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Moses said, you're not grumbling against this or that. Ultimately, you're saying to God.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   You're saying to God, "Answer my prayers."
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Not realizing that maybe
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   maybe the sovereign God hasn't lost
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   control. Maybe the sovereign God
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   who knows all things, has the power to do all things, has
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   orchestrated whatever situation that you may be in.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Maybe to teach us, to sanctify us
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   so that we can recognize who He is.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   But where does bitterness and grumbling come from? Because we
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   don't get what we want. We think it should be a certain
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   way and it is not. So therefore, grumbling and complaining comes. So ultimately
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   what is that? We don't recognize God or to give thanks.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   See, John Piper says of unthankfulness,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   "The key to unlocking a heart of gratitude and overcoming bitterness and ugliness
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and disrespect and violence is a strong belief in God,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   the Creator, the Sustainer, the Provider, the Hope Giver.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   If we do not believe we are deeply indebted to God for all we have or hope
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   to have, then the very spring of gratitude has gone
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   dry." The reason why there's ingratitude is because
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   we are not recognizing the Creator, Sustainer, Provider, and
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   the Hope Giver. We have put our confidence
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   somewhere else. We have put our confidence in our ability,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   in our circumstance, maybe in other people. And that's where ultimately
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   grumbling comes from. That's why Philippians 2, 14, 16 says, "Do all things
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   without grumbling or questioning." It
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   almost sounds kind of like inhuman. Like how can you expect human
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   beings to never be grumbling? But here's why, verse 15, "That you
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   may be blameless and innocent children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   holding fast to the Word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   proud that I did not run in vain or labor
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   in vain." He says not to be grumbling and questioning
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   because ultimately God is a sovereign God.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Now, this Thanksgiving
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   you guys are going to sit around the table and if you
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   have small children you're going to be asking, "What are you thankful for?"
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I'm thankful for my Legos. I'm thankful that Christmas is right around the corner.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   So, whatever I'm going to get that. Or if you're a little
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   bit more sophisticated and you're a little bit older and so you're thankful for your tests, that you
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   got a good grade on. You're thankful for the relationships. Or if you're a little
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   bit more godlier than that you may be thankful for the brothers
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and sisters who remembered your birthday and
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   constantly send you encouragement notes. And so
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   we're all thankful for things that we can see tangibly.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   These are things that we can see.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   But any human being, Christian or non-Christian, are going to be thankful for all
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   of these things. People who love me in my life, I'm thankful
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   for them. The non-Christians are thankful for them.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   The toys that you have, a new job. Tell me a non-Christian who's not thankful
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   for that. The distinction between a Christian's thankfulness
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and a non-Christian's thankfulness is that our thankfulness is unlike
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   the world because our thankfulness is coming from faith.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   From things that we do not see.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   See, he says, when we are not
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   grumbling and we're thankful, we shine
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   like light in a dark world. If we're
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   only thankful for things that the world is thankful for, how are we any different
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   than the world? It is when we're under pressure.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   When everything on the flesh looks like something is going wrong.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   But we see beyond that because we know a God who's beyond that.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   We know a God who is sovereign, who is in control. Even when everything
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   else looks like it has completely gone out of control, that we have a God who is absolutely
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   sovereignly in control. And that sovereign God loves us.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   He who did not spare his own son, how will
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   he not along with him give us everything? And if you believe that, that's the source
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   of Thanksgiving. Not your job, not
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   your health, not your friendship, not your support group,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   not the people who love you, not your family. But because
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   a sovereign God who is in control of every circumstance,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   what seems to be good, what seems to be bad, he is ultimately in control.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   When we lose sight of that, that's where grumbling comes.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Because I have determined what is right. I have determined what is good.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   And God is not living up to my expectation.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   It is the essence of what it means to be
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   a Christian. Grumbling is the opposite of what it means
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   to worship. And thirdly, Thanksgiving is at the
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   root of genuine worship. Thanksgiving is the root of
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   genuine worship. 2 Corinthians 4.15, "For it is
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   all for your sake, so that as grace extends more and more people,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   it may increase in thanksgiving to the glory of God."
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   If man's rebellion is
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   refusing to acknowledge God and to give thanks, then what is salvation?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Isn't it to restore that?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   To acknowledge a God who is sovereign,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   isn't that what salvation is? To give thanks? People who are unthankful,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   to be thankful, I mean to put it in a nutshell.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   That He extended His grace, that thanksgiving may
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   increase to the glory of God. That's why in Psalm 104 it says,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   "Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Give thanks to Him. Bless His name.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   What is God looking for in our congregation? In your personal lives? In your
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   family? What is He looking for more than anything else?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Worshippers who will worship in spirit and true worship. Not people who are going to
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   clock in and clock out. And you can do that even when you are praying,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   clock in and clock out. You can clock in and clock out reading the Bible. You can clock in and clock out
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   even serving the Church. But true worship.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Who will worship Him in spirit and in truth. So if worship is
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   directly linked to thankfulness, if you have a grumbling and complaining heart,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   you can't be worshiping. You are not worshiping because
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   worship, every song that we sing, everything that we declare is to come
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   for Him and say, "Thank you, you are worthy."
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   But if you are complaining and bitter, how can those two things go
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   hand in hand? See, thankfulness,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   thanksgiving is at the core of worship. And that's what God
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   is seeking more than anything else. Let me ask you a question.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   When are you the most thankful? If God is looking for true worshipers, and
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   true worship, the base of true worship is thankfulness, when are you
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   the most thankful? Don't say it, just think
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   about it. My guess is, like myself,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   we are the most thankful that when we deserve, when we get
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   something that we really didn't deserve. Right? So
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   some of you college students, you know, if you have finals coming up,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   you stayed up all night and you went to LA to get some boba,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   you know, and you played video games and then somebody told you, you had to study,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   or somebody told you, "I got a free pass, come to Disneyland with me." And you stayed up all night
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   going to Disneyland, you came back, and you probably studied for the finals in like two hours.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And then you took your test, and you got an A+.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And so you are thankful.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Because you know you didn't deserve that. Right? You know you didn't,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   you deserved an F, but you got an A. So you're thankful.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   You're going to come to church like, "Thank you, Jesus."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   During Thanksgiving, you're going to say, "I'm thankful for my A." Right?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   If you're at work, you know, you didn't do the best job. You screwed up.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You made mistakes, lost millions of dollars, and your boss comes and says, "You know what? That's your mistake.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   We've all done it. I'm going to give you a raise."
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   This Thanksgiving, you're going to be thankful. "I'm thankful for my
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   boss, working for a great company." Right?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   You blew your anniversary.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   You deserved a cold bed.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   No breakfast, lunch, or dinner for a while.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And your wife says, "I understand. You had a hard week.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   It was tough. Let's do it next year."
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And she makes you the best breakfast. "You're eating that.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   So thankful. I didn't deserve this."
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Right? Yet, my wife made me the best food in the world.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   We're the most thankful when we receive things that you and I know we don't deserve.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   What is it that you and I have been given
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   that we really, really didn't deserve?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And you know where I'm getting at.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   What is it that you and I have been given that we can't possibly even
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   fathom or even imagine?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   If we made up a story of salvation, we would never make this story up.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Even if you've never heard of the gospel and say,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   "Well, God sent his son to die for who?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   For rebellious sinners.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And the way that he saved us was he gave his only begotten son
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   to suffer for us." I mean, think about it.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   When you buy a brand new car and a friend looks at it and says, "Hey, let me take you for a ride."
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And that guy, you know, he's not the most careful, gentle person in the world.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   He's got 30 tickets and he likes to take it for a spin. He says, "Let me take you for a ride."
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   You know, your immediate reaction is, "Yeah, do it, man."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   You're going to think twice. It's like, "That guy's not going to take care of my car."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It's just your car.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You don't want a little ding on it. You don't want him driving over, you know, the speed bumps
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   at 30 miles per hour. And you're going to think of your shocks and, "Is he going to pass gas in my car?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   What is this guy going to do to my brand new car?"
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And you're going to hesitate and you're going to be bitter that he even asked you
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   and put you in that situation. Because we value this car.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And yet the Bible describes
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   to save sinners
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   who had no thought of seeking God
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   sent His only begotten son to die for us. What is it that
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   you and I have received that you and I did not deserve
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   that will inspire us to be thankful
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   other than the gospel itself?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   So when you really look at it that way,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   if you really look at it that way,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   wasn't He, by sending His only begotten son,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   giving us what you and I didn't deserve, wasn't He seeking
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   worshipers? Doesn't that fit?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   That that's the reason why He did what He did
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   to create a new creation that will worship Him in spirit
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   and in truth by giving us what you and I could not possibly even imagine
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   to even ask for. He gave it to us.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Not just justice.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Not just mercy. But grace.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   That's why in Ephesians 1, 7-10, it says, "In Him we have redemption
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   grace, which He lavished upon us in all
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   wisdom and insight, making known to us the mystery of His will, according to His purpose
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   which He set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   to unite all things in Him, things in Heaven and things on
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Earth." Lavished on us all that we need.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   So at the core of worship
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   is Thanksgiving. And then fourth and finally, Thanksgiving ultimately
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   is the evidence of genuine faith. Thanksgiving
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   is the evidence of genuine faith. James chapter 1, 2-3
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   you know that passage where it says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   of various kinds." You know when he wrote that letter
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   "Trials of various kinds" people were literally being
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   killed for their faith. We had people who probably
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   were very rich, like Apostle Paul, because they met Christ. They were being
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   beaten and put into jail. I mean their wives
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   their wives were being put into jail.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Their children couldn't function because they were followers of Christ. So when he says
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   "Trials of many kinds" he's not talking about, you know, I want Mexican food
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   but I can only find Korean food. We are not talking about the kind of trials you and I go
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   through. You know? And I know there is more than that. I'm just being, you know.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   You know at work it's like, "Oh he's a Christian. Ha, ha, ha. Don't invite him to our break."
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   You know, persecution.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   We are talking about people literally losing their lives
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and their livelihood. So when he says, "Encounter trials of many kinds, consider
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   it all joy." He doesn't just say, "Hey, suck it up and bear it."
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   No, he says, "Consider it all joy." If you
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   don't understand the context of this verse. If you don't understand the context
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   of the Gospel, it would make absolutely no sense. Not only
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   would it not make sense, it would be a tremendous burden.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   It would be a tremendous burden to tell people to be joyful
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   while you're going through all of these things. And a lot of times
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   even as Christians we try to fake it because we know what it says.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   We're not experiencing it but we know what it says. You know?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Just like if you have small children and you're trying to take pictures. And I know some of you guys
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   accuse me of that. We put up fake smiles.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   So when our, especially our boys when they were little, when they would take pictures
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   we would always say, "Smile, smile." And so they'll give you one of these.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   You know what I mean? It's just one side. Their whole face, there's no smile.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   It's just their lip is going up. Right? Sometimes that's what Christian joy
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   looks like. Doesn't it? You know?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Like you want to curse and you want to say all these things but you're at church.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   You know? And you're being watched.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   So you say Christian things. Right?
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   All things work together for good.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   And you say, you say all of these things but in your, inwardly
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   it was just, you're dying. How can He possibly
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   expect us to practice this? Here's why.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Consider all joy when you meet trials of many kinds
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   and that steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   lacking in nothing. Lacking in nothing what? Financially? Physically?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   No. Your faith. But faith is not
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   tangible. You don't taste faith. You don't see it.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Right? You can't put that in the bank.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And the only reason why you would face trials and consider it pure joy
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   is because you believe.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   It's because you believe that there is a sovereign God who is
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   orchestrating these trials to bring about perfection of your
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   faith. So the payoff, you may not be able
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   to see it but you believe it.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   If by sacrificing today that tomorrow
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   you get a brand new car. You know get rid of your you know 1999 car
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   and you're going to get a 2017 brand new car. You know no one would have
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   any problems. Consider pure joy when you junk your 1997 car.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Because tomorrow you're going to get a 2017 car.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Yes! Pure joy. Right?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   But the reason why Christians are called to do that is because the trade-off
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   is that God, the sovereign God, is using these sufferings
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   to bring about the perfection of faith. And only an individual
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   who believes that that is happening is the one who can really rejoice.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And that's why Thanksgiving
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   is evidence of genuine faith. Only an individual who is
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   genuinely believes the promises of God can be
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   genuinely thankful. Not fake it. Not give a fake smile.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Because you know a sovereign God is behind that.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   You look at the life of Joseph. All his life, all he did was be faithful to
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   God. And as a result of that he got beaten. He was thrown into
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   prison. He tried to be faithful to his master and to
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   shun the advance of his
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   wife Potiphar. And as a result of being faithful he gets thrown into jail.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   He's in jail and he tries to help people out. And as a result of that he stays even
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   longer. And at the end of his life, at the end of the
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   story we know what happens. His brothers who put him in that situation come and
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   they recognize him. Humanly speaking.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   This is Egypt. And this guy is very high up. He's a right hand man of the
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Pharaoh. There is no public defender to defend
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   him. There is no innocent until proven guilty. I mean this is
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   the Pharaoh's right hand man. I mean he could have eaten his flesh and we would all
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   understand and say, "Okay, what you did to me I do to you tenfold."
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Right? Vengeance. Right? Make a good
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   movie. And end with vengeance. Yes!
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   But he doesn't do that. Why is he not bitter?
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Why is he not angry? Why does he
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   not carry out vengeance? He could have killed all of them and it would have been completely
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   justified. And yet remember what he says in Genesis chapter 50, 19
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   through 21. He says, "But Joseph said to them, his brothers, 'Do not fear
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   for I am in the place of God.'" In other
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   words he is saying God placed him there. "As for you, you meant evil against me but God
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   meant it for good. To bring it about that many people should
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   be kept alive as they are today. So do not fear I will provide for
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   you and your little ones.' Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   them." Not only did he not kill them,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   not only was he not vengeful, he actually provides
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   for that family. That's not human. That's not a
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   normal human behavior. The reason why he was able to do that
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   because he believed in a sovereign God who was in control of all of these things.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   That even though your intention may have been evil, God was not.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   That's why we're thankful. That's
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   why only an individual who genuinely believes in that sovereign
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   and loving God can truly be thankful. That's why
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   in 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 to 18 he says, "Rejoice always."
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Not simply because your bills are paid, not because
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   you're healthy, not because you got a promotion.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Always, always means always.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   When encouragement or discouragement.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   When you have money or don't have money. When you're sitting in prison
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   or living in a penthouse.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   In every and all situation Paul says, "I have learned the secret of being
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   content." What is that secret? His faith.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Christ. In the midst of all
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   of that, it's not like he did yoga and he tapped into some inner
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   meditation that all of a sudden, boom, it opened up for him.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   He's talking about seeing Christ in the middle
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   of all of these things. That's why he says you can be thankful
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   in all situations for this is the will of God.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   The will of God is to make
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   people who did not honor God or give thanks to Him, opened our
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and made us
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   people who honor and thank Him. That's the will
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   of God. Our salvation, our sanctification to make us true
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   worshipers of God was the will of God. So how important is
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Thanksgiving for Christians? It is at the core of who we are.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   And that is why he says, "Do all things without complaining
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   or grumbling." Because complaining or grumbling is
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   the opposite of genuine worship.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   You can't worship and grumble at the
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   same time. So let me conclude with this. 2 Corinthians
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   4, 16-18. So we do not lose heart
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   renewed day by day. For this slight momentary affliction
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   is preparing for us an eternal way to glory beyond all comparison.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   As we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   are eternal. That is the distinction
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   between a Christian and a non-Christian. We come to celebrate a God that
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   we cannot see. We put our hope and the
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   promises of things that we cannot touch. We celebrate
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   and rejoice knowing that one day that we will be in a heaven that
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   we are not there yet. It is our faith that
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   causes us to see a God that you cannot see with your flesh.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And that is the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian. Isn't that
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   what happened to us when we got saved? When you believed and confessed
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   and repented, did you get a better house?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Did all the people around you all of a sudden become nice?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Did the school that you were trying to get into all of a sudden send you an acceptance?
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Did all the people who were annoying you all of a sudden change their
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   personality to accommodate you? What has changed?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Nothing physical. Spiritually we came alive.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It is faith. So the
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   source of our thanksgiving is not our circumstance,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   but being able to see our sovereign God behind all things. He who did
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   not spare his own son. How will he not along with him give us all things?
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Let's pray. When are you the most thankful?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   If God is looking for true worshipers and true worship, the base of
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   true worship is thankfulness, when are you the most thankful?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Don't say it. Just think about it.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   My guess is, like myself, we are the
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   most thankful that when we get something that we really didn't
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   deserve. Right? So some of you college students,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   you know, if you have finals coming up, you stayed up all night
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   and you went to LA to get some boba, you know, and you played
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   video games and then somebody told you, you had to study, somebody told you, "I got a free pass,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   come to Disneyland with me." And you stayed up all night going to Disneyland. You came back
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   and you probably studied for the final in like two hours. And then
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   you took your test and you got an A+. And so
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   you are thankful. Because you know you didn't deserve that.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Right? You know you didn't. You deserved an F.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   But you got an A. So you're thankful. You're going to come to church
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   like, "Thank you, Jesus." Right? During Thanksgiving you're going to say, "I'm
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   thankful for my A." Right? If you're at work, you know,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   you didn't do the best job. You screwed up. You made mistakes. Lost
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   millions of dollars. And your boss comes and says, "You know what? That's a human mistake. We've all done it.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   I'm going to give you a raise." This Thanksgiving
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   you're going to be thankful. "I'm thankful for my boss.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Working for a great company." Right?
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   You blew your anniversary. You deserved
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   a cold bed. [laughter]
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   No breakfast, lunch, or dinner for a while. And your wife says,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   "I understand. You had a hard week.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   It was tough. Let's do it next year." And she makes you the
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   best breakfast. You're eating that. So thankful.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   [laughter] I didn't deserve this.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Right? Yet my wife made me the best food in the world.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   We're the most thankful when we receive things that you and I know we don't deserve.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   What is it that you and I
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   have been given that we really, really
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   didn't deserve? And you know where I'm getting at.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   What is it that you and I have been given that we can't
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   possibly even fathom or even imagine?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   If we made up a story of salvation, we would never make this story up.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Even if you've never heard of the
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   gospel and say, "Well, God sent His Son to die
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   for who? For rebellious sinners.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   And the way that He saved us was He gave His only begotten Son
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   to suffer for us." I mean, think about it. When you buy a
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   brand new car and a friend looks at it and says, "Hey, let me take you for a ride."
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   And that guy, you know, he's not the most careful, gentle person in the world.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   He's got 30 tickets and he likes to take it for a spin. He says, "Let me take you for a ride."
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   You know, your immediate reaction is, "Yeah, do it, man." [laughter]
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And I think twice. It's like, "That guy's not going to take care of my car."
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   It's just your car. You don't want a little ding
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   on it. You don't want him driving over, you know, the speed bumps at
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   30 miles per hour. And you're going to think of your shocks. And is he going to pass gas in my car?
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   What is this guy going to do to my brand new car?
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And you're going to hesitate. And you're going to be bitter that he even asked you and put you in that
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   situation. Because we value this car.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   And yet the Bible describes to save
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   sinners who had no
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   thought of seeking God
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   sent His only begotten Son to die for us. What is it that you and I have received that you
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   and I did not deserve that will inspire
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   us to be thankful other than the Gospel
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   itself?
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   So when you really look at it that way,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   if you really look at it that way, wasn't
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   He, by sending His only begotten Son, giving us what you and I didn't
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   deserve, wasn't He seeking worshippers?
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Doesn't that fit?
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   That that's the reason why He did what He did?
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   To create a new creation that will worship Him in spirit and in truth
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   by giving us what you and I could not possibly even imagine
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   to even ask for. He gave it to us.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Not just justice. Not just mercy.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   But grace.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   That's why in Ephesians 1, 7-10, it says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, which
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   He lavished upon us in all wisdom and insight, making
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   known to us the mystery of His will, according to His purpose, which He set forth
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   in Him, things in Heaven and things on Earth."
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Lavished on us all that we need.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   So at the core of worship is thanksgiving.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   And then fourth and finally, thanksgiving ultimately is the evidence of
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   genuine faith. Thanksgiving is the evidence of genuine
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   faith. James 1, 2-3, you know that passage where
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   it says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds."
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   You know when he wrote that letter, "Trials of various
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   kinds," people were literally being killed for their faith.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   We had people who probably were very rich, like
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Apostle Paul, because they met Christ. They were being beaten and put into jail.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   I mean their wives,
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   their wives were being put into jail. Their children
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   couldn't function because they were followers of Christ. So when he says trials of many kinds
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   he's not talking about, you know, "I want Mexican food, but I can only find Korean
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   food." We're not talking about the kind of trials you and I go through. You know?
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   And I know there's more than that. I'm just being, you know, you know at work it's like, "Oh,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   he's a Christian. Ha, ha, ha. Don't invite him to our break." You know, persecution.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   [Laughter]
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   We're talking about people literally losing their lives and their livelihood.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   So when he says, "Encounter trials of many kinds, consider it all joy,"
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   he doesn't just say, "Hey, suck it up and bear it." No, he says,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   "Consider it all joy." If you don't understand the context
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   of this verse, if you don't understand the context of the Gospel,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   it would make absolutely no sense. Not only would it not make sense,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   it would be a tremendous burden. It would be
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   a tremendous burden to tell people to be joyful while you're
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   going through all of these things. And a lot of times even as Christians, we
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   try to fake it because we know what it says. We're not experiencing
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   it, but we know what it says. You know? Just like if you have small children
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   and you're trying to take pictures, and I know some of you guys, you know, accuse me of that.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   We put up fake smiles. So when our, especially
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   our boys when they were little, when they would take pictures, we would always say, "Smile,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   smile." And so they'll give you one of these.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   You know what I mean? It's just one side, their whole face, there's no smile, it's just their lip is going up.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Right? Sometimes that's what Christian joy looks like.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Doesn't it? You know? Like you want to curse
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   and you want to say all these things, but you're at church.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   You know? And you're being watched.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   So you say Christian things. Right?
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   All things work together for good. And you say,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   you say all of these things, but in your, inwardly it was just, you're dying.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   How can you possibly expect us
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   to practice this? Here's why. Consider it
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   all joy when you meet trials of many kinds, for you know
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness, and that steadfastness
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Lacking in nothing, what? Financially? Physically? No. Your faith.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   But faith is not tangible.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   You don't taste faith. You don't see it.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   You can't put that in the bank. And the only reason why you would
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   face trials and consider it pure joy is because
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   you believe. It's because you believe
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   that there is a sovereign God who is orchestrating these trials
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   to bring about perfection of your faith.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   So the payoff, you may not be able to see it,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   but you believe it. If, you,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   if by sacrificing today, that tomorrow you get a brand new car.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   You know, get rid of your, you know, 1999 car, and you're going to get a 2017
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   brand new car, you know, no one would have any problems. Consider it pure joy
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   when you junk your 1997 car. Because tomorrow
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   you're going to get a 2017 car. Yes!
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   Pure joy. Right? But the reason
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   why Christians are called to do that is because the trade-off is that God,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   the sovereign God, is using these sufferings to bring about the perfection
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   of faith. And only an individual who believes that
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   that is happening is the one who can really rejoice.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   And that's why Thanksgiving is evidence
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   of genuine faith. Only an individual who genuinely
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   believes the promises of God can be genuinely thankful.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Not fake it. Not give a fake smile. Because you know
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   a sovereign God is behind that. You look at the life of
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Joseph. All his life, all he did was be faithful to God.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   And as a result of that he got beaten, he was thrown into prison. He tried
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   to be faithful to his Master, and to shun
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   the advance of his wife Potiphar.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   And as a result of being faithful he gets thrown into jail. He's in jail
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   and he tries to help people out. And as a result of that he stays even longer.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   And at the end of his life, at the end of the story, we know what happens.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   His brothers who put him in that situation come and they recognize him.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Humanly speaking, this is Egypt.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   And this guy is very high up. He's a right-hand man of the Pharaoh.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   There is no public defender to defend him. There is no
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   innocent until proven guilty. I mean this is the Pharaoh's right-hand man.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   I mean he could have eaten his flesh and we would all understand and say, "Okay,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   what you did to me I do to you tenfold." Right?
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Vengeance. Right? Make a good movie.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   End with vengeance. Yes! But he doesn't do that.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   Why is he not bitter? Why is
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   he not angry? Why does he not carry out vengeance?
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   He could have killed all of them and it would have been completely justified.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   And yet remember what he says in Genesis chapter 50, 19 through 21.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   It says, "But Joseph said to them, his brothers, 'Do not fear, for I am in the
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   place of God.'" In other words he's saying God placed him
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   there. "As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   To bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   today. So do not fear, I will provide for you and your little ones.' Thus he
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   comforted them and spoke kindly to them."
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Not only did he not kill them, not only was he not
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   vengeful, he actually provides for that family.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   That's not human. That's not a normal human behavior.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   The reason why he was able to do that because he believed in a sovereign
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   God who was in control of all of these things. That even though your intention may
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   have been evil, God was not.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   That's why we're thankful. That's why only an
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   individual who genuinely believes in that sovereign and loving God
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   can truly be thankful. That's why in 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 to 18
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   he says, "Rejoice always." Not
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   simply because your bills are paid, not because you're healthy,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   not because you got a promotion. Always.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   Always means always.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   When encouragement or discouragement. When you have money or
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   don't have money. When you're sitting in prison or
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   living in a penthouse. In every and all
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   situation Paul says, "I have learned the secret of being content." What is that secret?
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   His faith.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Christ. In the midst of all of that, it's not like
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   he did yoga and he tapped into some inner meditation
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and all of a sudden, boom, it opened up for him.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   He's talking about seeing Christ in the middle of all of these things.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   That's why he says, "You can be thankful in all situations
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   for this is the will of God."
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   The will of God is to make people who did not
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   honor God or give thanks to Him, opened our eyes to see the glory
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ and made us people who honor
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   and thank Him. That's the will of God. Our salvation,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   our sanctification to make us true worshippers of God
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   was the will of God. So how important is Thanksgiving for Christians?
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   It is at the core of who we are. And that is why he
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   says, "Do all things without complaining or grumbling."
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Because complaining or grumbling is the
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   opposite of genuine worship.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   You can't worship and grumble at the same time.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   So let me conclude with this. 2 Corinthians 4, 16-18.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   "So we do not lose heart, though our
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   an eternal way to glory beyond all comparison. As we look not
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   That is the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   We come to celebrate a God that we cannot see.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   We put our hope in the promises of things that we
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   cannot touch. We celebrate and rejoice
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   knowing that one day that we will be in a heaven that we are not there yet.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   It is our faith that causes us to see a God
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   that you cannot see with your flesh. And that's
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian. Isn't that what happened to us when we got
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   saved? When you believed and confessed and repented,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   did you get a better house? Did all the people
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   around you all of a sudden become nice? Did the school that
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   you were trying to get into all of a sudden send you an acceptance?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Did all the people who were annoying you all of a sudden change their personality to accommodate
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   you? What has changed? Nothing physical.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   Spiritually we came alive.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   It is faith. So the source of our
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   thanksgiving is not our circumstance, but being able
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   to see our sovereign God behind all things. He who did not spare his own son.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   How will he not along with him give us all things? Let's pray.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Again as we
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   ask the praise team to come out, let's take some time to come before the Lord in prayer,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   in honest confession.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   As we reflect upon not simply the
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   material things that we ought to be thankful for,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   but even beyond that.
