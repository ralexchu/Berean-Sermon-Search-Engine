[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Hebrews 9, verse 18 and forward, "Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.760]   without blood.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.120]   For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.600]   law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.760]   and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, 'This is the blood of
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.920]   the covenant which God commanded you.'
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.380]   And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.800]   with the blood.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.440]   And according to the law, one may almost say all things are cleansed with the blood.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.960]   And without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.160]   Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in heavens to be cleansed with
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.960]   these, but the heavenly things themselves were better sacrifices than these.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.200]   For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.120]   into heaven itself, not to appear in the presence of God for us.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.160]   Nor was it that he would offer himself often as the high priest enters the holy place year
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160]   by year with blood that is not his own.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.440]   Otherwise he would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.440]   But now once at the consummation of the ages he has been manifested to put away sin by
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.720]   the sacrifice of himself.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.920]   And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, after this comes judgment.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.320]   So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.640]   time for salvation without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him."
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880]   Let's pray.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.760]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.040]   We thank you, Father God, that you've given us the privilege and the ability to be able
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.000]   to come before you.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.960]   Help us, Lord God, to not to take for granted what you have given us.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840]   Give us deeper understanding of your word.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   Amen.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.240]   All right, what if this morning I told you that I got a letter from the city of Irvine
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.080]   saying that what we are doing is illegal and that every single one of you who are here
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.120]   this morning has broken the law and after the service is over there is going to be Irvine
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.480]   PD waiting for us and every single one of us is going to go to jail.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.040]   And there is no bail and you're just going to have to wait for your sentencing.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.880]   What if I told you that and that was true?
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   Most of you probably don't believe me.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.920]   First of all, what we're doing is not illegal because we're outside, right?
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.080]   But what if that was true?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.840]   What if that was true and that there is going to be consequence for the behavior and afterwards
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   that you're all going to go to jails?
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.760]   No matter what I say from that moment on, my guess is most of you are going to be thinking
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.080]   about how to prepare.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   What should I do?
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.360]   Did I lock the doors?
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960]   What about my kids?
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   What about work?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.440]   Do I call them?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.920]   Whatever responsibilities that you have coming, that's coming, that thought is going to consume
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.080]   your mind because of the indictment that's coming after the service.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.360]   For whatever the reason, we hear the passage in Hebrews 9, 27, it says, "Inasmuch as it
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.480]   is appointed for a man to die once, after this comes judgment."
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.160]   The beginning of understanding of the gospel is recognizing that God's anger is burning
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.960]   against sinful world.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.520]   And so, when the gospel is presented, that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.120]   your life, and that's all you understand about the gospel, even though, whether you believe
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.840]   it or not, that's how you heard the gospel.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.960]   The next question that's going to be coming is, "If God loves me, why would he judge me?"
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   If God loves the world, why would he allow famine?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.160]   If God loves the world, why would he allow war and sex trafficking?
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.920]   My guess is, you've either asked that question before, or you have many friends around you
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.280]   who ask you and say, "You know, I can't believe in your God for that reason."
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.440]   You say he's loving, you say he's gracious, but why would he allow these things to happen?
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.880]   It is not that that statement is false, but there's a reason why the whole purpose of
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.600]   the tabernacle was to prepare and to teach the nation of Israel that they are not to
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.720]   enter into God's presence just willy-nilly, that you can't just walk in and say, "Here,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.920]   God, here I am."
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.580]   The whole point of the tabernacle was to teach the nation of Israel that a sinful man cannot
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.520]   be in the presence of this holy God.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.760]   And so this elaborate ritual of setting up the tabernacle, what animals to use, who to
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.120]   what, what tribes are supposed to touch what part, that there's this elaborate explanation
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.360]   of what they are to do, what they are not to do, and the punishment for not obeying
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.240]   that and coming into the tabernacle just willy-nilly was capital punishment, that you would die.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.660]   He says that everything that happened at the tabernacle was simply a copy of the reality
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.960]   found in heaven.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.160]   If you have a false understanding of the gospel, you will live the rest of your life saying,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.620]   "God is not fair because he didn't make me this way.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.300]   God is not fair because he didn't give me this.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.040]   God is not fair because he didn't give them that."
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.780]   Because the gospel has been presented in a self-centered manner, as if God actually owes
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.780]   me something.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.160]   That is not the beginning of the gospel.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.920]   The beginning of the gospel is we've offended a holy God.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.880]   That if we die in our natural state, it says, "As it is appointed for all men to die once,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.280]   after this will come judgment."
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.780]   All men are appointed to die once.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.200]   The world right now is freaking out.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.140]   They're freaking out because maybe, many people for the first time in their life, death has
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.540]   become a reality.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.800]   Because of this virus, because of what's being spread in the news and some percentage of
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.080]   people who have certain risks, and if they get this virus, they're going to die.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.260]   And although we all know 100% of the people who were born into this world will die.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.040]   Whether you die from a virus, whether you die from an accident, whether you die of a
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.400]   heart attack, whether you die of diabetes, whatever you die from, at some point, 100%
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.840]   of the people will die.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.380]   It is appointed for all men to die once.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.320]   But the focus for people who death is not a reality, will focus on, "Oh, we're going
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   to die.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.440]   We're going to die."
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.720]   That's not the biggest terror.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.760]   That's not the biggest problem for mankind.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.720]   It's the second part.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.480]   Because whether you're good, whether you're bad, we will all die.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.360]   But the second part when it says, "After this comes judgment."
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.080]   It's the second death that the purpose of the gospel helps us to deal with.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.160]   It's the wrong or incomplete understanding of the gospel causes people to live their
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.960]   lives focused on this world.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960]   God is not fair.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   God is not fair.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.760]   God is not fair.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.440]   But if you understood, if you read the Bible carefully, the starting point of the gospel
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.560]   is understanding that we've offended a holy God.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   And if we die in this natural state, there is judgment waiting.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.200]   And the judgment is described all over scripture, and particularly in Jesus' parable, where
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.920]   he talks about gnashing of teeth, where there's a hellfire that will burn and will not be
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.440]   quenched and it is a horrendous place.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.680]   And he says that judgment is waiting for all who die in their natural state.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.720]   So why is it, if that is the beginning of the gospel message, where so many people who
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.240]   have supposedly heard the gospel, live the rest of their lives wondering why God is not
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.720]   fair?
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.000]   Instead our focus ought to be, if that is the state that mankind is in, in his natural
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.520]   state, how do we get out of that?
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.760]   How do we get out of that judgment?
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.000]   How do we guarantee that when we die that we are not going to face a God who's going
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.120]   to judge?
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.200]   That's the whole point of the tabernacle.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.880]   The whole point of the tabernacle is to appease the wrath of a holy God.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.440]   It wasn't to get into the tabernacle and say, "Well, if God is pleased, maybe I'll have
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   a better life.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.360]   Maybe he'll give me, you know, maybe he'll bless my business, or maybe this will happen,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   or that will happen."
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.400]   That was not the point of the tabernacle.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.200]   Tabernacle was not a place for them to come and build a community.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.080]   Tabernacle was not a place where they came and strategized how they can do away with
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.280]   poverty.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.760]   The church was not a place, the tabernacle was not a place where they can come together
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.800]   and see all the suffering in the world and how do we strategize to meet the needs of
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   the world?
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.640]   That was not the point of the tabernacle.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.120]   The tabernacle's primary purpose was to appease the anger of God.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.680]   And that's what the sacrifices were for.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.800]   So the whole point of the tabernacle, as he says in verse 22, "Without the shedding of
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:13.160]   blood there is no forgiveness, and without forgiveness we remain under God's wrath."
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:21.520]   There's nothing that any human being who believes this truth that needs to answer and have this
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.960]   answered clearly than this fact alone.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.160]   Are we forgiven of our sins?
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:37.000]   In the copy that pointed to the reality that was going to come in Christ, what specifically
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.520]   did it teach about forgiveness?
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   If the whole point of the sacrifice, the whole point of the tabernacle was to appease the
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   anger of God, how did they receive forgiveness?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.480]   What was the tabernacle that was established, taught the nation of Israel?
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.840]   Number one, there's four things I want to highlight this morning.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.480]   Number one, forgiveness requires active repentance and not just passive acceptance.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.080]   Forgiveness requires active repentance and not just passive acceptance.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.400]   You know, even in the way that we present the gospel, and after the gospel is presented,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.480]   we typically will say, "Anyone want to accept Jesus Christ?
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   Accept him."
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.380]   And if we're not careful, and I'm not saying that that language in and of itself is wrong,
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:26.840]   but if we're not careful, we can give the impression that God has offended us and he's
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.780]   the one coming and apologizing to us if we're not careful.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:37.100]   The way that the gospel is sometimes presented is, "Give Jesus a chance."
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.820]   He did not come, he did not come to give us purpose.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   That's not our problem.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.180]   You know, I don't know, I don't know what my purpose is.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.220]   You don't have purpose because you don't know who God is.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.100]   And if you know God, he'll give you purpose.
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.500]   God did not send his only begotten son so that we can live our best lives now.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.380]   That's not our problem.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.060]   Our best lives is meant to be lived in eternity with Christ, not here.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.420]   You see, sometimes if we're not careful, the way that the gospel is presented is man-centered,
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:16.020]   and so even after people accept Jesus, they live man-centered using Christ to pursue their
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.300]   idols.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.920]   Forgiveness required active repentance.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.180]   If you read verse 19 and 22, and I'm not going to read all of this, but if you read 19 and
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.780]   22, it gives a glimpse.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.740]   Remember when we were studying the book of Leviticus, how tedious every part of this
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.920]   tabernacle was.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.060]   God gave instructions on what animal to sacrifice for what sin.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.920]   He gave instructions on where it needed to be sacrificed, who can touch the sacrifices,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.500]   even the priest, what outfit that they were to wear when they're in the tabernacle versus
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.700]   when they're outside the tabernacle.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.540]   Even when they had to pack up the tent, he said only this tribe of the Levites can touch
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.980]   these poles, and only this tribe of the Levites can touch the ark of the covenant.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.180]   He said the animals had to be without defect.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.700]   Certain animals needed to be slaughtered this way, certain animals needed to be slaughtered
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.980]   that way, and then with the blood to sprinkle this, sprinkle that, on what day to do what.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:22.980]   I mean, it is an elaborate description of what was required for them to appease God's
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.660]   anger.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.860]   And think about it, if you were a Jew, you didn't just casually walk into the tabernacle
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.700]   and say, "Ah, you know, last night I sinned, and I'm so sorry," and then it's like, "Forgive
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.060]   me," and then just walked out.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.420]   That's not how it happened.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:44.860]   Imagine the tabernacle served over a million people.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.860]   You ever go to the DMV?
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.820]   The DMV is a place where people serve, and you know, we have to renew our license, and
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.460]   if now, I mean, I think it was a lot better when I was younger, but now if you want to
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.860]   go to the DMV, it almost takes three months of appointment, right, because they're so
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.460]   backed up, and if you just show up without an appointment, you might be there for five,
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.220]   six, seven hours, depending on what day you go.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.220]   Imagine the tabernacle was serving over a million people, and it was only one tabernacle,
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.420]   there wasn't a tabernacle per tribe.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:20.180]   And so imagine all of those people, when they sinned, had to come to the tabernacle and
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.140]   give sacrifice.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:29.140]   So not only were there tedious instructions on what they were to do, the fact that even
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.860]   going to the tabernacle required much planning.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.060]   My guess is they probably had to make reservations.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:42.780]   If it takes three months to get to the DMV to deal with our license, right, imagine how
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.380]   backed up the tabernacle must have been every single day.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:53.700]   See, all of that taught the nation of Israel that when they wanted to repent, when they
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.780]   wanted to appease the anger of God, there was this ritual that they had to go through,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.620]   and all of that taught the nation of Israel.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.900]   Repentance was not a casual acceptance.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.620]   It was an active pursuit.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:14.260]   That's why in Matthew 3, 7-8, "But when he saw many Pharisees, Jesus, and Sadducees coming
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.220]   for baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   wrath to come?
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.340]   Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance.'"
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.660]   Repentance wasn't simply acknowledging, "You know what, I agree with you, this is wrong."
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.340]   And if we're not careful, repentance becomes nothing more than acknowledging that it's
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.340]   wrong.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.900]   That's not what repentance means.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.700]   Repentance means to turn away from whatever it is.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.940]   It's not repentance just to say, "You know what, I agree with you God, I agree that's
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.500]   wrong."
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.820]   The word for repentance means metanoia, to change your mind.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:57.460]   But it doesn't simply mean that you thought it was right and all of a sudden now you believe
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.460]   it's wrong.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:04.580]   It is a call to turn away from whatever it is that we believe is wrong.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:12.860]   In 1 Thessalonians 1.9, when the Thessalonians met Christ, they became the model church in
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.860]   Macedonia.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.860]   And this is how Paul describes them, "For they themselves report about us what kind
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.460]   of reception we had with you and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.980]   God."
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.180]   They turned from their idols to serve the living God.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:36.340]   As I mentioned several weeks ago about the Hindu lady who wanted to accept Jesus Christ
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.180]   but had no intentions of ever turning away from their idols.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:47.540]   And our idols in our secular, humanistic, materialistic society is the pursuit of money
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.500]   for our hope, for our security, for our refuge.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:57.360]   So that pursuit for many Christians has never been put away.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.300]   And so we pursue the world while we accept Jesus Christ.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.100]   And for some reason that has become normal in our culture.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.100]   In fact, if you don't do that, what do they say?
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.380]   You're a Jesus freak.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.220]   You're a freak because you're not normal.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.860]   And then if you pursue Christ passionately, you say, "Oh man, you shouldn't just be a
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.140]   lay person.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.100]   You should be a pastor.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.360]   Or maybe you shouldn't be a missionary because you're passionate about pursuing Christ."
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:36.240]   But for whatever the reason, we've delineated between a natural repentance and following
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   Christ which is a call to every single person.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.300]   We made it a unique thing for a few Christians.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.740]   And those people who are leaders should model that.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:53.080]   For the rest of us, God is okay with us continuing to have our idols and just casually and passively
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.500]   accepting Christ.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.600]   Repentance requires an active pursuit.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.200]   Ephesians 2, 1-2 it says, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, which you formerly
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.840]   air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience."
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:20.780]   Repentance means to turn away from our idols and to turn to the living God.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:28.100]   And so first thing, imagine if you were a Jew living at that time, again, it was no
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.800]   casual event for you to go to the tabernacle.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.300]   You didn't just wake up and say, "Oh, I feel bad.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.840]   I'm going to go to the tabernacle, take care of this, and then I'm going to just get back
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   to my life."
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.700]   No, it required planning.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.700]   It required money.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:47.400]   It required probably an atonement, clearing of your schedule, and all of that because
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.080]   you were convicted that you needed to atone for your sins.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.480]   Secondly, forgiveness required a mediator.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   You can't separate the tabernacle with the priest.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.920]   When you think of priest, you think, "Well, where's the tabernacle?"
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.120]   You think of the tabernacle, it's like, "Where's the priest?"
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.000]   Why did God do that?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.420]   Because it's extra work.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.120]   Now we know that these priests were not holier than other people.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.920]   God didn't survey the nation of Israel and say, "Well, these guys are holier, so they're
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.880]   going to represent me and them to me."
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.240]   No, they were just as sinful.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.840]   If you study the history of Israel, you'll find that the Levites were just as guilty
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.900]   as anybody else.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.000]   But the reason why God established a mediator, again, it was a copy of the reality that was
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.880]   going to be found in Christ.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.440]   This was to teach the nation of Israel, again, that they were not to casually walk into the
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   tabernacle.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.280]   They needed to consider carefully which path that they were going to go through.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.640]   They needed somebody to mediate for their sins, and obviously this ultimately pointed
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   to the coming of Christ.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.880]   Hebrews chapter 9, verses 24 to 25, "For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.520]   a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.000]   for us."
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.800]   The tabernacle only represented the presence of God.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.560]   What Jesus did was he mediated into the actual presence of God.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:23.220]   And so now he says he is a mediator between us and God, not only for now, but for eternity.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:29.280]   And that's why we have eternal security, because he stands between us for eternity.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.560]   And it was, again, to teach them that the desperate need for Jesus Christ.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.840]   You know, years ago, the term "evangelical Christian" had to be placed, instead of saying
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.480]   that they're just Christians because Jehovah's Witnesses were calling themselves Christian.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.540]   The false gospel teachers were calling themselves Christians.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.200]   The Mormons were calling themselves Christians.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.440]   And so they needed to identify, no, we're evangelical Christians.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.040]   And evangelical Christians meant that in the core doctrine, we believe the same thing about
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.240]   the identity of Christ and the gospel message.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.360]   Today, that term "evangelical" has been so watered down.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.120]   There are people who call themselves evangelicals who will say openly and publicly that Jesus
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.400]   is not the only way.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.160]   He's the best way.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.800]   And you have these televangelists who are coming on television when they are asked,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.700]   "Do you believe that Jesus is the only way, that the Hindus and the Buddhists, that they
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.780]   will not, when they die, they're not going to go to heaven?"
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.380]   And the response that they give is, "Well, who am I to judge?
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.680]   We're just about the love of Christ.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.720]   Life is hard enough as it is.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   I'm not going to.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.520]   Only God can judge, and I'm not in a position to judge."
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.920]   If you're not in the position to make that clear, you're not in the position to speak
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.680]   for God at all.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.240]   Because the Bible says, "He who preaches a different gospel other than what I have preached
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.120]   to you, let him be anathema."
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:21:00.600]   And the fundamental need for the atonement of Christ was because that was the only way,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.540]   only through the blood of Christ.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:09.500]   If there was another way for a sinful man to appease the anger of God, it would be the
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:16.580]   greatest injustice that God would send his only begotten Son and crucify him, allow him
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:21.680]   to suffer what he has suffered, as just a way.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.420]   If there was any other way, if there was even one other way to give his only begotten Son
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:35.860]   to suffer and absorb our sins and to present him as just a good way, just as a way.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.540]   Imagine how offensive that must be to God.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.900]   You think if there was another way I would have sent my Son?
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.460]   You think if somebody else could mediate, if there was another path to get to me, that
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.860]   I would have ever allowed that to happen to my Son?
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.620]   Think about how offensive that is.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.980]   As these televangelists are more concerned about what the non-Christians would say and
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:01.340]   how they would be offended, than to consider how God would be offended.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.860]   The Bible is crystal clear.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.900]   If anybody is in doubt that there is only one mediator between us and God, the man Christ
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.900]   Jesus.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.820]   Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and no one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.820]   Nobody.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.820]   There is no other way.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.900]   There is only one mediator.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.420]   Third, forgiveness is costly.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.300]   In 923, "Therefore it was necessary for copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.060]   with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.060]   Better.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.020]   Now that's as understatement as you can get.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:44.580]   Imagine if you spent all your life investing a good chunk of your paycheck for your retirement,
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.580]   and at the point of your retirement you realized you went to the banker or whoever was managing
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.420]   money and they said you have nothing in the bank account.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.940]   Imagine how you would feel.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.780]   Especially the more, the harder you work to invest in that portfolio, the more disillusioned,
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.940]   the more angry you would become.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.100]   Because it was a lot of money that you've invested in that.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.140]   It wasn't just a few bucks.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.420]   Let's say 50%, 60% of your money went to that.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:20.380]   Now think about it as a Jew, a good faithful Jew in the old covenant.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.340]   You know in the new covenant there's a lot of people who say, "Oh you know 10% that's
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.060]   too much, you know that's a lot of money."
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.740]   And I remember somebody years ago who talked, you know, talked about like they were having
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:36.940]   a hard time giving their 10% or tie and they realized that every, every tenth that they
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.980]   give that this is a payment for a good Mercedes, right?
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   It's like Mercedes, I mean I know, you know, Mercedes is not considered the best car, maybe
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.020]   the best Tesla out there, whatever car is good, right?
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.460]   Or a Raptor, whatever is your dream, okay?
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:01.540]   They say, "Oh man, if I don't pay this money then I can literally get, drive the
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.380]   nicest car that I can want."
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:10.420]   An Old Testament saint, if they're a faithful Jew, if you added up all the things that God
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.580]   mandated, right?
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.440]   10% was only one of the commandments.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.700]   If you added all the things that God mandated of a faithful Jew, they say it comes out to
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.460]   somewhere around 35%, 35%.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.920]   And again, this was mandated, right?
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.380]   On top of that, you gave sacrifices and you have the free will offerings.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.600]   When God gave you a great harvest, you would give a thank offering to him or something
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.480]   good would happen and you would give an offering on top of that.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.900]   And then on top of all of that, you gave these sacrifices.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:51.260]   A lamb or a goat for a farmer at that time would have been somewhere around three to
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.180]   five days of his wages.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.180]   That's one lamb.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.800]   I'm not even talking about a bull.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.180]   One lamb would have been five days, three to five days of his wages.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.640]   So on top of the 35%, on top of whatever else you gave to God, you had all these sacrifices
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   that you gave.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.920]   So let's say if you were a good Jew, a good Jew, a conservative estimate is somewhere
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:21.040]   around 40 to 50% of your income was placed into the sacrifices to give to God.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.760]   Now imagine at the end of that, Jesus comes and says, you've added nothing.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.280]   There's nothing in your portfolio.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.860]   The point of all of that was the point of the reality that was going to come in Christ.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.860]   So what was the point?
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.660]   What was God trying to teach the nation of Israel?
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.220]   That these sacrifices were costly.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.860]   The one that is coming, the sacrifice that's going to be given to you, whatever it is that
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:56.340]   you have placed in order to come to God is going to pale in comparison to the cost that
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.840]   God is going to pay to bring you to him.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.580]   And so that's what the tabernacle taught the nation of Israel.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:12.460]   He said Christ's sacrifice in verse 28, having been offered once to bear the sins of many.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.340]   No matter how costly these lambs were to the farmer or to the individual, he had to do
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:23.160]   it again because it would only appease the sin of that person for that event.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:31.140]   But only Christ's sacrifice could be offered up once for all for many sins.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.300]   And there's a reason why Christ, his sacrifice, why he had to be the son of God.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:42.940]   Only the son of God's sacrifice could have appeased the sins of many once for all.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.340]   That's what it says in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 17 and on.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.980]   It says, "If you address father, the one who impartially judges according to each one's
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.340]   work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth, knowing that you
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.100]   are not redeemed with the perishable things like silver or gold or from your futile way
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.860]   of life inherited from your forefathers, but with the precious blood as of a lamb, unblemished
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.980]   and spotless, the blood of Christ."
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.620]   When we recognize what it is that we have in Christ, the first thing that it does in
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.900]   us is produce worship, thankfulness.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:28.140]   When we live week to week, focus on the things that God hasn't given us.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.140]   Faith is only begun.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.820]   It says, "Yeah, I believe that Jesus died for me, but why did he make me this way?
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.940]   I wish I was better looking.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.940]   I wish I lived here.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.940]   I wish I had parents that were like this."
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.340]   And you live the rest of your lives kind of like, "Yeah, yeah, thank you.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.860]   Thank you Jesus for dying for me on the cross.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.340]   But yeah, how about my job?
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.340]   How about my family?
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.340]   How about this?
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.540]   And how about that?"
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.420]   The first thing that it says, it kills your, you're not worshiping.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.140]   It kills your worship.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.940]   You can come to church, you can serve, you can give, but you're not worshiping.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:04.380]   Because the fundamental foundation of worship is an overflowing gratitude of what God has
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.220]   done for me.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.980]   If we do not mature, you know, maybe you've heard the gospel and you didn't fully understand
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:16.740]   the cost, but then because we've never pursued, we've never understood, we've never matured
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:23.020]   in our faith, there is never a growing gratitude for Christ.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.180]   And so we just kind of like what Christ did for us, justification is a long history behind,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.700]   something that happened years ago, but today, what have you done for me lately?
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.620]   You know, when we're young, we don't think twice about the house that we lived in, the
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.460]   food that we ate, you know, the shoes that we wore.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.100]   We don't think about that because it's just a given, you know.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.100]   But guess what?
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.780]   You pay for those shoes, somebody.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:59.540]   You know the food you ate, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, that didn't just pop out of nowhere,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.540]   that wasn't magic.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:06.580]   You didn't just wake up one morning and then poof, food just appeared on your table, you
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.580]   know.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.540]   You know the clothes that you wore when you were a kid?
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.540]   You didn't get that out of thin air.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.300]   Somebody got that for you, somebody.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.020]   Not sure who, somebody.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.180]   You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.280]   It didn't cost you anything, but it wasn't free.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:32.500]   You know, it isn't until we have children and we start raising kids and we start realizing,
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.740]   man, my parents did that for me.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   My parents did that for me.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.620]   When we're younger, we're always comparing with the other guy who has a better car and
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.420]   better shoes and better clothes and better this and better that.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:51.740]   Until you raise your own kids, you know, I mean you know it mentally, but you don't fully
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:57.980]   understand like everything requires payment.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.740]   So you have to work, especially if you come from immigrant parents, right, they had to
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.300]   get blue collar jobs.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.460]   You know, people always ask like, "Oh, is your church doing okay?"
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.540]   You know, because all these churches are having problems because people are laid off, they're
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.540]   furloughed.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.620]   But for the most part, our church is okay because most of us are, you know, white collar
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.620]   workers.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.660]   White collar jobs are, it's not completely safe, but it's much safer.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.660]   It's the blue collar workers, right?
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.880]   And so we live in a neighborhood where I think majority of the people are doing okay.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.240]   If you come from an immigrant family, you know, it doesn't matter what kind of education
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.140]   they had, wherever country they came from, when they came here, they had to do physical
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.140]   labor.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.220]   And you don't think much about that.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.420]   It's like, yeah, you know, the food that I ate, the thing that I complained about, it's
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.820]   like, "Oh, why are we having this again?"
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.780]   My dad had to empty trash cans so that we can have food.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:00.980]   My mom had to work in a, you know, dry cleaners and 105 degree heat in Burbank so that they
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.300]   can pay the rent.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.820]   You don't think about that when we're young, you know.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.220]   Yes, it was free for us, but it wasn't free.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:14.900]   And part of maturing in life is recognizing that what we have was given to us.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.540]   See, even as Christians, sometimes we just take for granted.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.980]   It's like, "Oh, yeah, go to church.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:24.300]   And how come the church isn't giving me this and this and that?"
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.460]   The very fact that you are here even understanding anything that I'm saying is because it was
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.820]   given to you by the blood of Christ.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:39.500]   It was his blood that caused you to open your ears that you can see and hear who he is.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.700]   If it wasn't by the grace of God, if it wasn't for the sacrifice of the Son of God, we wouldn't
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.460]   have this work.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.580]   We wouldn't be here.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.180]   We can't sing these songs.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.500]   We don't have access to this holy God.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:59.820]   See, part of maturing is recognizing the costliness of what it is that he has given us.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:05.460]   And our natural response when we recognize the cost of God the Father giving his only
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:11.440]   begotten Son, and Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, did not consider equality
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.940]   with God something to be grasped, but he emptied himself and he became nothing.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.940]   For what?
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.980]   So that you and I can eat.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.980]   You and I can live.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.020]   So you and I can have hope in eternity.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:32.940]   And recognizing that and growing appreciation of that is what causes true worship.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:37.740]   Fourth and finally, forgiveness is the basis of our hope.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:44.220]   Hebrews 9, 27, "As much as it is appointed for men to die once, you will die, Christian,
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.780]   non-Christian alike."
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.740]   This is a 100% agreement.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:56.140]   You know, part of the problem of living in a rich world is that we marginalize death.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.620]   We only see death when we go to funerals.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:05.280]   And even then, the dead body is dressed up nice, put makeup on, and so to make them look
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.460]   like they're alive, as close to being alive as possible.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.980]   And so for a brief period, we think of death.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.060]   But for the rest of our lives, we marginalize that.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.140]   We know it's real and it's theoretically real, but it's not real.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.860]   And that's why so many people are freaking out because of this virus.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.460]   Because all of a sudden, death is real.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.460]   You can die.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.460]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.460]   Not you can die.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.540]   You will die.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.540]   You will die.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:39.420]   "In as much as it is appointed for all men to die once, you will die."
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.540]   Whether you die as a young person or old person.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.380]   Whether you die violently or you die peacefully.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.740]   "It is appointed for all men to die once."
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.420]   He says, "After this comes judgment."
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:59.340]   See, but he says in verse 28, "So because of that, because of the state of mankind,
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.340]   God could have said, 'You know what?
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.540]   I am disgusted.'"
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:07.700]   Just like Caleb was describing, you know, that rice that's molded is disgusting.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.500]   When we see disgust, what do we do?
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   Turn away.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.940]   Don't run toward disgust.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.340]   If you see, if you walked into a bathroom and somebody barfed in there, right?
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.340]   Turn around and you go out.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.220]   "I can't use that bathroom.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   It's disgusting."
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.940]   You don't go looking for a mop.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.940]   That's not your responsibility.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.400]   You don't get paid for doing that.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.340]   If you go into, you know, a public transportation and somebody defecated, you don't walk in
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.060]   there and say, "Hey, give me a trash can, trash bag."
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.060]   You walk away.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.500]   You wait for the next bus.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.540]   God saw the filth in us and he didn't turn away.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.100]   He didn't turn away.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.180]   He said, "Because it is appointed for man to die once, after this comes judgment, and
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:57.060]   so because of that, Christ also having been offered once to bear sins for many, will appear
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:04.140]   a second time for salvation without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him."
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.900]   He says, "Christ will come in his full glory."
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:13.060]   For those who have been forgiven, whose sins have been atoned for, his glory means salvation.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:20.740]   His glory means consummation of our marriage that he started here.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:27.460]   But you know, again, because of a superficial and partial understanding of the gospel, most
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.380]   people when we talk about glory, we only think of heaven.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:37.980]   And I've heard people say that heaven is the presence of God and hell is the absence of
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.180]   God.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.840]   There is nothing in the scripture that says that.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.020]   Hell is not the absence of God.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.580]   God is not omnipresent except hell.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:56.060]   And typically, if you see Hollywood, heaven is where Satan is God, right?
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.060]   And he reigns.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.860]   And so people have this image, and a lot of Christians even have this image of, you know,
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.020]   Christ is present in heaven, but in hell he's not there.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.780]   And that's why it's so horrible, because the goodness of God is not there.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.380]   Hell is a horrible place because of God.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:19.940]   When we talk about glory, glory basically means to take the essence of who he is and
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.940]   to magnify it.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.620]   When Jesus was going to the cross, he said, "It is time for me to glorify you and for
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.340]   you to glorify me."
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:33.460]   And so when we think about heaven as Christians, we think of his mercy, his compassion, his
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.100]   gentleness, his patience.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.460]   But at the same time, the cross wouldn't make sense if that's all it was.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:47.780]   The cross is the cross because where the wrath of God was placed upon his son.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:55.220]   His greatest anger, all the sins of the elect were placed upon his son.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:01.620]   And so the only way the wrath of God could have been appeased was by the cross.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.860]   So the glory of Christ does not only mean the goodness of God.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:12.420]   The glory of Christ also means the judgment of God.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.780]   Hell was created by God for Satan and his angels.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.060]   And those who continue to follow him will also be judged.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.340]   So it is a place of torment even for Satan.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:30.500]   When Christ comes in his glory, for those whose sins have been atoned for, we'll see
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:35.700]   the glory of Christ in his magnificence and his compassion and our love for him and his
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.020]   love for us will be consummated.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.580]   But for those who do not know him, where the wrath of God remains on him, his glory means
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.460]   terror.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.660]   And it is more terrible than anything that you and I could possibly imagine.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.860]   More terrible than this disease, more terrible than an atomic bomb, more terrible than anything
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.220]   that you and I can imagine.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:03.340]   What we see in the book of Revelation, as terrible as Revelation is, Revelation is warning
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.580]   for sinners to repent.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.140]   You ever wonder why the book of Revelation, the judgment of God comes in intervals?
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.100]   Why it doesn't just come all at once and judge at the end?
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:19.940]   Through all of his judgments, through the seal judgments, through the trumpet judgments,
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.980]   through the bowl judgments.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:26.540]   Why does he go through this elaborate drama of judgment after judgment after judgment?
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.820]   Because each stage of judgment is an opportunity for sinners to repent.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.220]   So even the book of Revelation is a revelation of the kindness of God.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.940]   Because once the final white throne judgment comes, it is the end.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:48.260]   And there's a reason why there isn't an elaborate description of the final judgment.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:53.020]   Because it is going to be more terrible than anything that you and I can imagine.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:39:04.540]   Knowing, knowing this, shouldn't our primary concern be about the second judgment?
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:12.460]   We are so tangled up right now, worried about how to make this world a better place.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:18.580]   And sometimes by people who have never shared the gospel, all of a sudden is so concerned
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:25.620]   about making sure that the boat that is headed for judgment is a nice, comfortable boat.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.700]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.980]   The Bible calls us to be good witnesses.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.500]   God calls us to be compassionate.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.660]   If there is wrong, we ought to call it out.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.100]   We need to stand for justice.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.740]   The Bible says it ought to be the character of a Christian.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.500]   But the mission of the church is to spread the gospel.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.300]   It is to spread the gospel.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:56.140]   Because you can make this place the best place to live, and at the end, there's still judgment.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:02.500]   The hope, only hope for mankind is the blood atonement of Jesus Christ.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.500]   So I pray again with all my heart, with all the chaos that's going on around us, at least
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:13.740]   for you and I, that we would give our energy to things that's not going to change.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:18.260]   People ask me, "Hey, Pastor Peter, how come you don't talk about the political stuff that's
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.260]   going on around us?"
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.620]   So you know, I can tell you my opinion.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.780]   I have a lot of opinions.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   Ask me about anything.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   I have an opinion.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.660]   I'm a bit too opinionated.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.660]   Ask me about your shoes.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.860]   If you really want me to know, you don't want to know, I'll tell you.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.900]   If you really want to know, you don't want to know, right?
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.980]   Because if you ask me my opinion, I'll give you my opinion.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:46.340]   I don't like giving false compliments because then it doesn't mean anything, right?
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.940]   So if I say I like it, it means I like it.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.900]   If I don't like it, I'll tell you I don't like it.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.020]   So don't ask me if you really don't want my opinion.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.620]   If you want like a puff piece, you don't want me, right?
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.460]   But the reason why I don't give my opinions up on the pulpit is because it's my opinion.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.300]   That's my opinion.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.660]   Political stuff that's going on.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.340]   Yeah, I have strong opinions.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.340]   I'm a Republican.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.340]   Does that offend some of you?
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.900]   I'm a proud Republican.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.260]   I have my opinions.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:20.740]   But I don't make that my primary talk on the pulpit because that's my opinion.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.940]   Our churches should not be divided because of our opinions.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.460]   We should not be fighting each other because of our opinions.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.780]   We should not be marching for our opinions.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.820]   What you and I need to stand for is a truth that 10 years later we don't look back and
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.500]   say, "Oh, I was wrong about that.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.020]   Oh, I changed my mind.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.540]   Oh, the culture has changed.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.740]   Oh, things have shifted."
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.140]   That is not what this pulpit is for.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.620]   That's not what this church is for.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.460]   We stand for truth and truth does not change.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.340]   And truth is not my opinion or your opinion.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.580]   It does not change.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.340]   So we need to stand for the truth, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.500]   And we have to make sure that we are anchored in that and don't move no matter what's happening
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.380]   around us as Christians so that the world will know that there is hope only in the name
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.740]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.740]   Amen?
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.140]   Let's pray.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:19.620]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace and love toward
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.900]   us.
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.940]   I pray that the truth of your word.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:33.980]   I pray for the drama of the tabernacle, the sacrifices, the priesthood, the cost.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.500]   May it all make deep impressions in our hearts, Lord God, that we may recalibrate our mind
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.820]   and our heart according to the gospel that you've given us.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:47.140]   Help us to live for the things that are eternal, not just temporal.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.260]   Help us to be united, Lord God, in our voices to honor and glorify you in all things.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.800]   So we pray, Father, that as a church that you would keep us grounded.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.380]   And as the world is desperately seeking for answers, I pray, Father God, that we would
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.780]   be ready in season and out of season to give the reason why we are so stubbornly attached
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.380]   to you.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.060]   May your grace be sufficient for us.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.220]   In Jesus' name we pray.
