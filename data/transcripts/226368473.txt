[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   Heavenly Father, we ask, Lord, that you would bless the time that we have together, that
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.600]   the study of the end times would cause us to be sober, help us to study in faith, that
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160]   all of these things, Lord God, that we eagerly wait with anticipation.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.240]   Even though we may not understand the various details of all the visions that John is seeing,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.160]   I pray that what you've intended to warn, to encourage, to strengthen your church through
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.960]   this letter would have its effect on us.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.080]   So help us, Lord God, not to simply put in our time, but that your word would speak to
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.600]   us and through your Holy Spirit, Lord God, that you would guide and lead.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.200]   Okay.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.920]   All right, so there's two basic visions.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.800]   The first one only covers a couple of verses, and then the second one, the two witnesses.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.240]   The first one begins with the commandment to go measure the temple, right?
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.280]   And so the image of measuring is used in the scripture in various ways.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.160]   What is the purpose of this measuring?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.400]   Sometimes the imagery is used as a plumb line.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.000]   Some of you guys may remember in the book of Amos where God tells Israel that on the
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.280]   surface they look like they are right, but God places a plumb line to see if they were
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   really right with God because they were deceiving themselves.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.840]   God clearly saw them that their worship was tainted, but according to the law of God,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.760]   the word of God, they were not right with him.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.320]   And so God was using the plumb line to reveal to them how far they've strayed away from
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   God.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.280]   And so that imagery is used in the book of Amos and also in 2 Kings.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.240]   Sometimes the imagery is used to measure those who are righteous, so Zacharias 2, 1 through
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.000]   5, again, where there's measuring going on for the purpose of not revealing sin, but
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   to reveal their righteousness.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.160]   We're going to see that measuring again in the book of Revelation in much more detail
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.960]   when it's talking about the new Jerusalem, right?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.400]   It's going to have an elaborate, detailed description.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.480]   So the whole debate in the book of Revelation, in particular chapter 21, is that is that
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.280]   a description of heaven or is that a description of the millennial kingdom?
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160]   We'll get to that when we get there.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.520]   Depending on how you interpret that is going to have a huge effect on how you see the other
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   parts of scripture, okay?
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.160]   But we're going to get to that.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.680]   So that is measured in detail in chapter 21.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.720]   But what is the meaning of that?
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.280]   Why does God in this text ask John to take measurements of the temple, the detailed measurement
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.640]   of the temple, and tell him not to measure the outer court?
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.120]   What is the purpose of that?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.720]   Well, we see a similar thing that happens in Ezekiel.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   I think I have a, yeah, Ezekiel 43, 6, 3, 8.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.080]   I'm not going to read all of it, but he says, "While the man was standing beside me, I heard
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.680]   one speaking to me out of the temple.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.360]   And he said to me, 'Son of man, this is the place of the throne and the place of the soles
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.080]   of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.440]   And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880]   by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places.'"
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.400]   I'm not going to keep reading.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   But basically, after he reminds the nation of Israel that the temple is God's house,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.320]   and then he says, "You've been defiling my house by disobeying and going after other
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.200]   idols," and then he tells him in the next passage to go take all these measurements
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.800]   of the temple, of all the different articles, right?
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.720]   So again, it kind of correlates with what he's doing here.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.360]   So why would you ever take measurements of your house?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.640]   Okay, those of you guys who have your own house or your condo, when would you take measurements
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   of your house?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.880]   Just to tell your friends how big your house is?
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.520]   When do you take measurements of your house?
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.800]   You're remodeling, right?
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.320]   Rebuilding, it's for the purpose of building or modeling, right?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   So the imagery that we see of God telling them to take measurements, it's not that God
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   is remodeling, but it is to signify his presence, that he's restoring the temple, right?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.600]   He's restoring the temple.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.960]   So the measurement of the temple signifies renovation, restoration of God's presence
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.880]   in Israel, right?
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   So basically what he's saying, remember, where are we in the seven-year tribulation right
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.560]   now?
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   Where are we?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.000]   In the seven years, where are we?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.640]   Look at my hand.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   Seven years, where are we?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   You're half, right?
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.720]   Three and a half years into it, and he says, remember, time, times, and a half of times,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.440]   three and a half years, right?
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.840]   We're going to get to that in a minute.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.200]   So he's right at the half mark, and up to this point, up to this point, God says he's
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   going to bring judgment.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.880]   But remember what he says last week?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   That he was not going to delay?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.320]   Yes?
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.620]   He was not going to delay.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.700]   So meaning, he was not going to delay in fulfilling the promise to his people, and he's no longer
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.160]   going to delay in bringing judgment upon mankind.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.440]   Up to this point, he's been warning the nations.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.400]   He was bringing judgments, remember, a fourth of the nature, a third of the people, and
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.340]   then this fire and all this stuff is coming, but all of it, in the midst of all of that,
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.000]   he's waiting for them to repent and return.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   So even in the midst of all of this intense judgment, God is allowing them time to repent.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.480]   Then last week, right, last week, God responds and says, it will no longer delay, meaning
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.000]   the rest of the judgment is going to come swiftly, and restoration of his people are
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   going to come swiftly.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.240]   So the measurement of the temple is God's promise that he's fulfilling, that he's going
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.400]   to restore what was lost, right?
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.680]   The temple, meaning the church, the church which is going to experience intense persecution,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.160]   God's going to purify the church, and in the midst of that, the judgment is going to be
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.520]   intensified, right?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.640]   So remember, is the second half more intense or the first half more intense?
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.840]   The second half, right?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   The real intense judgment we haven't studied yet.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.400]   We didn't get to that.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.700]   That's the seal judgment.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.060]   So up to this point, God's, you can call it discipline more than judgment, but here and
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.480]   now, God's going to bring the judgment upon mankind.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.560]   So that's what the measuring of the temple represents, that he's going to strengthen
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.940]   the church while the judgment upon mankind is going to intensify.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.360]   He said, though there's going to be intense tribulation, the church will be protected
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.040]   during a 42 weeks reign of terror by the beast, right?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.200]   And again, that's recorded in Revelation chapter 13, 5.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.920]   Do I have that?
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   No.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   Okay.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:30.760]   The outer court is going to be overtaken by the nations and trampled on for 42 weeks.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.720]   And the significance of that, the outer court of the temple being trampled on, that signifies
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.560]   the temple is going to be corrupted by false worshipers.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.720]   And God's going to restore the true church, but he's going to allow the fake church, the
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.380]   superficial church to be judged.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.140]   So if you remember, remember Matthew 24, 24, one of the qualities that God says is going
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.720]   to bring upon mankind, Matthew 24, 24.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.400]   Anybody remember?
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.960]   There's going to come a delusion, right?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:10.040]   Deception that even the elect may be deceived if that was possible.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.200]   Meaning that that's how severe the delusion is going to be.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.160]   False prophets, divisions in the church where God's going to purify the church.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.400]   So it may come through persecution.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:26.260]   It may come through false prophecies, false leaders, and then divisions in the church.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.380]   And then, you know, when typically if there is anything that comes into the church that
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.640]   divides the church, it doesn't divide with one evil and one good.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.120]   It's usually both sides thinking that they're good, right?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.280]   And so he said the deception is going to come so strongly, right?
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.360]   If possible, even the elect will be deceived.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.960]   Again, long run, of course, the elect is not going to be deceived, but it's to convey how
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.840]   serious this judgment is going to be.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.400]   And God is going to allow that in the church at the end.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.080]   He's going to strengthen the real church, right?
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.960]   The real worshippers of God, but those who are superficially worshipping, meaning that
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.500]   maybe the non-Christians, the false worshippers, he's going to allow the church, a portion
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.080]   of the church to be trampled.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.140]   And that's what he means by that, right?
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.600]   This is going to happen during a period of 42 months, 1,260 days.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.880]   It is referring to a time of intense distress, tribulation, persecution, and destruction.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.240]   So we're at the halfway mark, and it's going to get worse, but at the tail end of that,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.540]   it's going to get severely intense.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.360]   And so that's what the measurement of the temple signifies, right?
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.200]   God's going to draw near.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.960]   And whenever God draws near, always two things happen, right?
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.840]   The righteous are comforted, and the sinners are punished, always.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.320]   Because that's what happens when revival comes.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.820]   Revival doesn't come and encourage everybody.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.760]   Revival comes and identifies sin.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.960]   And so the repentant are forgiven.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.520]   The unrepentant are disciplined, right?
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.000]   And so that's how it's described at the end times before the intense judgment comes.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.840]   God's going to bring revival in the church, but revival to true believers, right?
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.040]   And the superficial or maybe false believers who are following false prophets are going
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.640]   to be identified at that time, and they're going to be judged by it.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   And so that's going to set up for the next scene where the two witnesses are going to
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   come.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.320]   Now, the identity of the two witnesses, no one knows this for sure.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.240]   And I've read all the arguments behind what they believe, and depending on which view
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.440]   you have.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.460]   But none of it seemed like to me a slam dunk.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:59.000]   But some of the suggestions, some have suggested that they are symbolic of the church, right?
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.800]   And basically them going out, proclaiming the gospel, and there's going to be a revival,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.540]   and many people are going to come to Christ.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.240]   And then at the tail end of that, the beast is going to come and slaughter the church,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.000]   intense persecution.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.340]   And after three days, again, all of these things are symbolic.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.560]   And after the three days, God's going to resurrect the church, and there's going to be a rapture,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   right?
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.920]   Again, this is one of the suggestions of what these two witnesses represent.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.360]   Another suggests that they might be Moses and Elijah.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.960]   And the reasoning behind why they think it's Moses and Elijah is because of the powers
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.720]   that they have.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:43.840]   The powers that are described that what these two witnesses are able to do are very similar
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   to the powers that, again, Moses, God used Moses to present when he was delivering the
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.160]   nation of Israel, or Elijah, and a lot of the powers he had.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.720]   So that's where they think maybe that it might be Moses and Elijah.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.600]   Another reason why is, remember at the transfiguration, right, Moses and Elijah shows up.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.620]   So they think that maybe it's Moses and Elijah.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.580]   Another suggestion is Enoch and Elijah.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.520]   Can somebody take an educated guess why some people would think that this might be Enoch
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.520]   and Elijah?
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   You're right.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520]   They don't die.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   So remember, the witnesses die, and then they come back to life.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.000]   God puts his breath in them, they come back to life.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.520]   And so they think that must be signifying those two people who didn't die, right?
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.160]   Enoch is caught up, and he goes up to heaven.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.980]   Same thing with Elijah, right?
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.960]   But again, none of these are just suggestions.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.100]   Again, to me, when I was reading through all of this and the reasoning behind that, none
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.800]   of it seemed like a slam dunk to me.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:57.760]   But we know, at least in character, they were wearing sackcloth, signifying a call to repentance.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.800]   It's very similar to the garb that John the Baptist wore.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.920]   The description of John the Baptist's garment wasn't sackcloth.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   It says it was camel hair, but it was similar to sackcloth.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:17.160]   And it signified very plain clothing, a prophet that is detached from the world and basically
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.680]   is calling people to repentance.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.280]   And that was the central call of John the Baptist, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   is at hand."
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.480]   So if you look at these two messengers, it doesn't tell us specifically what they were
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.040]   preaching, right?
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.080]   But whatever it was that they were preaching, it made the people angry.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.280]   And we're going to get to that in a little bit.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.760]   It made them angry.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.600]   So it looks like, when you put two and two together, that the primary message, and considering
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:50.960]   the context, that it's a preparation for Christ to come, that he's preaching the repentance.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.840]   So it's kind of like playing the same role as John the Baptist.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.960]   He's preparing for the coming of Christ, and his message is to allow them to repent.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:07.800]   So even up to this point, even up to this point, God is pleading with the world to repent.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.600]   And he's given a final warning that any, and this spectacular miracle is going to happen.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.880]   These two people are going to come back to life.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.320]   And even then, the people who refuse to repent won't repent.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.720]   But that seems to be the main message that they're going to be bringing.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.820]   They are called two olive trees and two lampstands.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:39.560]   We already know that the lampstand represents that they are lightbearers for God.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:47.600]   In the beginning of Revelation, who else is called lampstand?
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.760]   Who else is called the church, right?
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.240]   The seven churches are the lampstand.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.120]   And Jesus says that we are the light of the world, right?
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.140]   So we are light collectively, we are light individually.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.920]   And so these two witnesses said they're lampstands for God, they are lightbearers.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:11.140]   So what does the olive tree represent then?
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:18.960]   If they are the lamp, what does the olive tree represent?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   What does the lamp need?
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   Huh?
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.880]   Oil, right?
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.980]   So the olive tree is a source of this oil.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.800]   So to say that they are lampstand and they're olive tree, meaning that there is an eternal
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:39.240]   supply of oil, that this is not a temporary position that they have, right?
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.680]   They're permanent lampstand for God.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:50.960]   That's what these two witnesses represent.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.480]   It says that during the time of their 42 weeks of ministry, they're going to be protected
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.280]   supernaturally.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.160]   They said that they're going to have power over waters, turn them into blood and strike
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.280]   the earth with every kind of plagues as often as they desire.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.800]   So again, that's part of the reason why I don't think that this is the church, right?
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.480]   Because the way it's described, they have supernatural powers.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.880]   And these aren't just ordinary prophets or apostles.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.280]   No apostle or prophet was able.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   Maybe Elijah.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.880]   Elijah is the only one that we can think of that had this kind of power, right?
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   Not even Moses.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.480]   Moses, God used him to do certain things.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.920]   But these two witnesses, we don't know exactly what their identity is, but they weren't ordinary
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   prophets.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.200]   They're not ordinary apostles, right?
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.660]   Even the angels, right?
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.720]   Not all angels had this kind of power.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.240]   So again, we don't know exactly who they are, but during their ministry, there's going to
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.320]   be a lot of miracles that's going to take place and no one's going to be able to oppose
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   their message, right?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.640]   And their powers that are described are very similar to the power of Elijah that we see
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.640]   in 1 King chapter 17.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   And again, partially that's the reason why some people suggest that this is… one of
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   them is Elijah.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   But whatever the case is, right?
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.560]   Whoever these two people are, whether it's symbolic, it represents something, it basically
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.480]   says at the end, before the Antichrist comes, there's going to be a period of intense evangelism,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.840]   right?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.880]   Whether that's three and a half years or whether that's a longer period, if we believe that
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.040]   this is something that's going to come in the future, that God is going to purify the
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:49.080]   church and basically He's going to purify the church, maybe it's going to come through
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.920]   intense persecution, right?
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.760]   And the people who've been kind of holding on to God superficially, you know, as soon
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:03.160]   as the tree gets shaken, the fake fruits are going to fall out, right?
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:09.400]   And then through the fire, the real Christians, the true believers who are holding on, that
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.640]   they're going to experience a revival.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.600]   And that's exactly… if you talk to the pastors in India, that's exactly what they say.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.640]   Right now, I mean, you can go online and read about persecution around the world and India
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.920]   is almost like… they're going up on this ladder, almost on a monthly basis.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.260]   I don't know if you heard, I read an article just about three days ago, a pastor was coming
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:35.120]   out of his church and two young men on their scooter just came by and shot them point blank,
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.360]   dead, just because they were Christians.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.880]   So this type of stuff is increasing in India all the time, you know.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.120]   So when we talk to the pastors, I say, you know, how do you deal with all of this?
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.040]   And they said, it's been good for the church.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.520]   You know, I say it's been good for the church because only serious Christians come to church.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.260]   So you can imagine what the fellowship is like, right?
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.480]   When every single person that's there are being tested with their life, that whether
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.280]   they really believe this or not.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:07.200]   So the Bible describes at the end times that the persecution is going to be so intense
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.320]   that it's going to be a gathering of true believers.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.880]   But once they're the gathering of true believers are together, there's revival, right?
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.320]   And there's going to be intense evangelism.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.360]   So whether it's going to be two literal people or the two prophets or if it's symbolic of
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.200]   the church, however you interpret that, it basically is saying that revival is coming,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   right?
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.720]   But again, revival is not coming for everybody.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.440]   He said the outer court is not going to be measured.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:42.280]   He's going to allow that part of the church to be trampled on, right?
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.040]   So after accomplishing the ministry to proclaim repentance for preparation of the coming of
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:55.200]   the King, they are immediately killed by the beast that arise from the abyss.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.080]   The beast is not Satan to clarify.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:06.280]   Satan is described in Revelations 12, 3 and 9 as the dragon.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   So the beast is getting power from Satan, from the dragon.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.240]   But he is not the beast himself.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.720]   So if he's not the beast, if he's not Satan himself and he's getting power from the beast,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.480]   who would he be?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480]   He's not the beast.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:30.440]   He's not Satan himself, but he is a high servant of the beast.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.640]   Antichrist, right?
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.200]   Antichrist that Paul mentions in 2 Thessalonians, right?
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.420]   That he's the antichrist, the man of lawlessness is going to come.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:49.660]   And so he arises from the abyss, right?
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.640]   And according to Revelations 13, 1 through 8.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.960]   So there's going to be a more detailed description of who the beast is and his activity in Revelation
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.800]   chapter 13 and 14 and on.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.160]   So when we get there, we'll go into more deep description.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.920]   But he's described as a political figure.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.240]   It doesn't say political, but again, when we get there, we'll talk about it more.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.180]   But it basically describes how the 10 horns are going to unify.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.460]   And then out of the 10, the 3 are going to go overpower the others, right?
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.680]   And so I've heard so many interpretations of that.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:29.000]   I remember, I'm assuming most of you guys don't remember, but years ago when the European
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.800]   Union was coming together, I don't know, how long was that?
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   That's more than 10 years.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   It's got to be 20 years.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   You need to remember.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   It was a while back.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.980]   It was a while back.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.860]   But I remember when the European Union was coming together and they're going to combine
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.240]   their currency and there was a lot of end time prophets who were saying that that was
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.360]   a 10 nation federation, you know, and then they were trying to connect the dots.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.160]   I don't know if that's true or not, you know, but a lot of that was coming from this, from
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.480]   the beast and how it's described.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.360]   Again, chapter 13, not here, right?
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.920]   But I'm not going to get too deep into that because when we get into that, I'll talk a
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.880]   little bit more about that when we get to chapter 13 and on.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.360]   But his activity seems like a political activity.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.840]   He's going to gather the authorities, the kingdoms of the earth, and he's going to bring
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.380]   it under his leadership, right?
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.760]   So there's going to be a period of Antichrist rule where Christians are going to be under
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.520]   the dominion of the Antichrist, right?
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.800]   So again, that's when the persecution obviously is going to increase.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.320]   I'll mention briefly here, okay, but I'll get into deep a little bit later.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.040]   Again, this is not this text.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.840]   It's going to come up later, but I think the Antichrist is going to be a religious/political
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:58.560]   figure because he's going to be so beloved that he's not going to force people in fear
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.140]   to submit to him.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.280]   He's going to have people give allegiance to him because they want to, and he's going
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:10.640]   to have a religious overtone to who he is, right?
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.960]   So there's been a lot of guesses about, you know, during the Reformation period that that
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.920]   was the Pope, right?
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.880]   Now I think it's going to be Christian.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.240]   I don't think it's going to be Muslims.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.720]   I think it's going to be, because he's going to come in as an angel of light representing
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.360]   Christ.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:35.600]   So I think the only way, so this religious figure is going to unify all the nominal Christians,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.760]   nominal Muslims, nominal Hindus, and nominal Buddhists.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   What did I miss?
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   Right?
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.080]   All the nominal groups are going to be gathered together under one umbrella, and then the
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.720]   one who ends up coming out as a leader of that federation eventually is going to be
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   the Antichrist.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   That's my opinion, okay?
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.240]   Don't go quote me and saying that he's saying crazy things, right?
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.280]   The reason why I think that is because when I look at the scripture that it's going to
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   be a religious figure, he's going to have political power, people are going to give
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.680]   them allegiance, and the only person that can do that is, again, a religious figure.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.640]   Considering it's an angel of light, I think he's going to have the name Christian on it,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   right?
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.720]   If you look at the political environment now, because of all the terrorism that's taking
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:30.440]   place, any extreme group, whether you are a Muslim or a Christian, is being lumped up.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:38.560]   Any fundamentalist in any group, whether you are a Hindu or a Jewish or Christian or Islam,
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.640]   is kind of put into one category.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:47.200]   So there's a nominal Christian, nominal Christianity, nominal fringe groups are becoming the central,
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   and they're gathering together.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.560]   There are more and more churches that are coming together and declaring unification
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.040]   with other religions, right?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:02.600]   So what we consider universalism, all roads lead to God, it just happens that your road,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.160]   Christian road leads to God, the Hindu road leads to God.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.520]   So that type of thinking and that type of heresy is growing in our generation because
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.720]   of the extremists.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:17.400]   So at some point, right, and if you haven't noticed, at some point, being an evangelical
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.120]   Christian, you're going to be equated, your faith is going to be equated with the extreme
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.820]   jihadists, right?
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.020]   And based on that, if you haven't noticed, that's already happening in Europe, it's
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.280]   already happening in Canada, they could actually take your children away in Canada.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.400]   I don't know if you guys have been reading the article, they passed an ordinance that
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:44.880]   if you teach things that are contrary to the belief of the state, right, about the liberal
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.760]   agenda that they have, they actually have the right to take your children away.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.820]   So you can't teach what you believe inside your own home, right?
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.020]   So I think that's going to eventually spread all over the world.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:59.740]   And so what's unifying the world right now is a reaction against Islam, the extreme,
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.060]   the terrorism.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.140]   But a reaction against that is also causing a reaction against anything, what they consider
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.140]   extreme, right?
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.060]   Now this is all, you know, this is all just kind of piecing things together and we'll
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.780]   talk about that more when we get to the later chapters.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:20.160]   But I believe at the end time when Antichrist actually comes, that he's going to be a religious
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.580]   figure that's going to have all the nominal groups under his umbrella.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.140]   And then he's going to eventually reveal himself as who he is.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.760]   But I think that that's what's happening.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:36.180]   Right now if you look at the world events, that's exactly what's happening.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.660]   The abyss is not hell.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:46.100]   In Luke 8.31 it describes that as a place of punishment.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:52.700]   Okay.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:58.540]   So again, this is not hell, but it's described as a place of punishment where the demons,
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.420]   certain types of demons are held in captivity until a period when God allows them to be
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.420]   released.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.420]   Right?
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.820]   Hell is an eternal state that once they get in, that that's going to be a place of punishment
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.500]   for eternity.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.260]   So these two witnesses have so much power, so that anybody who opposes them, they have
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.920]   the authority to basically extinguish them, to kill them.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:29.620]   But at the end of their 42 weeks, the beast comes out of the abyss and they overpower
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.620]   them.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.620]   Right?
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:38.620]   So as strong as these, powerful as these two witnesses were, are, the Antichrist is going
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.980]   to be even stronger.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.420]   So that kind of gives you a picture of how powerful the Antichrist is.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.340]   So again, we are warned in Jude chapter nine, where the Archangel Michael's contending
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.620]   with the devil, with disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce blasphemous
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.500]   judgment but said, "The Lord rebuke you."
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.940]   In other words, he says, not to be arrogant, to think that somehow we're going to battle
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.940]   Satan by our own authority.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.940]   Right?
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.580]   And I think the mistake that we make is one, we make the devil too big.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.580]   Right?
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.340]   A lot of that coming from movies that we watch.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.540]   Right?
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:20.720]   The demons and all these demonic figures overpowering the priests and the church and they're cowarding
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.260]   and feared and nothing can get in their way except for a little cross or something.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.260]   Right?
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:33.500]   And they kind of over exaggerate the power of Satan over the cross, over Christ.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.140]   But the other mistake that we can make is to make him too little.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.140]   Right?
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.500]   Where we think, "I'm going to..."
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.780]   You know, I had friends a long time ago, back in college, where the charismatic movement
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.980]   was in full bloom.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:53.700]   And I remember they dedicated their summer to go after demonic powers.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   Right?
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.160]   They were kind of the charismatic group and they said they were going to take a mission
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.620]   trip to Utah and they're going to go head to head with the demons.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.260]   And I remember they were asking people for prayer.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:09.300]   I remember hearing the whole time, I was like, "What the heck are you two doing?"
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.020]   And they were going and asking, telling people, you know, they called themselves like, I forgot
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.500]   what it was, but we called them Ghostbusters.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.660]   Because that's basically how they were selling themselves.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660]   Right?
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:25.100]   But basically we were warned if we make too much of him where we think that what God tells
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.700]   us he was in us is greater than he was who is outside of us.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.700]   Right?
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.700]   Talking about Satan.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.300]   That Satan has no power over his children.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:38.580]   But at the same time, if we don't respect his power, then we don't understand the kind
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.580]   of battle that we're in.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.260]   Right?
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.980]   The spiritual battle that we're in.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:49.180]   That we can somehow think that if we're clever and if we just unite together, right, and
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.940]   if we just did the right things and had the right people that somehow we can win this
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.940]   spiritual battle.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:54.940]   Right?
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.540]   And that's another severe mistake that the church can make.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.540]   Right?
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.820]   This is not a battle that you and I can win by being strong.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.980]   It's the only way that we can engage in this battle is to put on the spiritual armor.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.060]   Right?
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.340]   That we're told in Ephesians chapter six.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.420]   And so that's how it's described here.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.460]   As powerful as these two witnesses were, the Antichrist comes up and he overpowers them
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:24.500]   and he kills them.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.260]   The two witnesses are killed.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.260]   Right?
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.940]   They are not buried.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.460]   Right?
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:40.660]   Again, you probably see images, right, the terrorists in certain parts of Middle East,
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.700]   they will kill the American soldiers or the people that they captured and they'll kill
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.180]   them and then they won't bury them.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.820]   What is the meaning behind that?
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.900]   Right?
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.220]   Is an example to warn other people.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.660]   Another is for humiliation.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.020]   You mess with us, this is what's going to happen to you.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.780]   And it shows an extreme hatred toward those people that they killed.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.080]   So terrorists, exactly, they're trying to instill terror upon people.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.700]   You mess with us, this is the power that we have.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.700]   Right?
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:20.460]   And again, it's to publicly display the kind of hatred that they have toward the people
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.620]   that they're killing.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.340]   And so the fact that these two witnesses are killed and these two people, these witnesses
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.060]   are God's light, they're directly sent.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.060]   Right?
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:38.200]   And they're pleading with the world for repentance and the hatred that they garner for speaking
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:46.500]   the truth was so, again, was so intense that even after they killed, nobody buries them.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.220]   They said that this happens in the big city.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.100]   The big city, most scholars believe, is talking about Jerusalem.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.500]   And this is where our Lord was crucified.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.020]   And there's going to be another intense spiritual battle that's going to take place.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.020]   Right?
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   There was an intense battle that took place in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified and
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.740]   resurrected.
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:13.860]   And again, at the end time before Christ comes, there's going to be a great spiritual battle.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.020]   And again, this is, again, reiterating what I said.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:23.380]   The fact that the nations gaze at their bodies without burying them, right, it signifies
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.620]   the intensity of the hatred that they had toward the two witnesses.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.460]   And again, the reason why they had this hatred toward the two witnesses is because they hated
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.580]   their message.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.060]   And their message was repent.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.060]   Right?
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   Judgment is coming.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:53.820]   The two witnesses are brought back to life by God.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:58.340]   And as they are called up by a loud voice, a great earthquake hits the city, killing
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.780]   7,000 people.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:05.540]   Again, we see the prophecies in Ezekiel 38, 19 and Zechariah 14, 4.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.540]   Right?
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:15.140]   So, all of these things that we see in Revelation, there are pieces of these revelations in Ezekiel,
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:22.140]   in Lamentations, some in Isaiah, a lot of it in the book of Daniel, in Zechariah.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.140]   Right?
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.300]   So, after you study the book of Revelation, go back and study the major prophets and the
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   minor prophets.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   Right?
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.820]   You're going to see how much of that language is in the book of Revelation.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.660]   I could just sit here and just quote the Old Testament.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.660]   Right?
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.700]   Just, but then we'll just sit here and I'm just kind of like 15 verses behind every verse
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.700]   that we talk about.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:46.060]   But you're going to see how the book of Revelation is a compilation of all the prophecies that
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.420]   were made in the Old Testament and how it's coming together here in the New Testament.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.300]   So, all of this, I'm just mentioning a few verses, but all of these, you'll see parallels
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:59.140]   in the Old Testament.
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:04.860]   And it says that when this earthquake comes and these two witnesses are risen, it says
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:10.180]   that they were struck with fear and they gave glory to God.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.980]   Right?
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.820]   The world was struck with fear and they gave glory.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:20.300]   Does that mean that the whole world repents and come to Christ?
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   Probably not.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   Right?
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.620]   So, what does it mean to give glory to God?
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.500]   Giving glory to God here is not signifying repentance, but a forced acknowledgement of
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.540]   God's power.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.020]   Right?
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:41.220]   Remember, when the first judgment comes and they see the judgment of God coming, what
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.220]   do they do?
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.620]   The people run up to the hills and they hide beneath the rocks instead of repenting.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.980]   So, their hearts are so hardened.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   At this point, they've made their decision.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.420]   So, if they would have come to repentance, they would have come to repentance already.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:01.780]   Even after all of this, they would cling to idols and they're going to give their allegiance
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.980]   to Antichrist, but they're not repenting.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.380]   And we're going to see that as we continue to study.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:20.460]   So, when the seventh trumpet is blown instead of revelation, a great plague or disaster,
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.300]   we hear voices in heaven declaring the eternal sovereignty of God and His Christ.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.220]   So, there's a period of intense revival in the church.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.900]   These two witnesses come and they begin to preach the gospel and warn people and bring
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.900]   them to repentance.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.940]   There's a battle that happens with the Antichrist and then he comes into power.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.620]   These two witnesses go to heaven.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.780]   And then the seventh trumpet is blown and immediately we don't see the next judgment.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.460]   We see a scene up in heaven.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:53.140]   It's almost kind of like you're taking a break from all this disaster that's happening and
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:58.420]   kind of, you know, it's almost like the world is in absolute chaos.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:04.860]   Earthquakes, famines, persecution, and it's just going nuts, right?
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.300]   That's what we've seen for three and a half years and it's going to get even more intense.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:17.020]   But before he gets to the real intense persecution of the bold judgments, he gets a glimpse again.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.860]   He goes back and he gets a glimpse of heaven.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:23.460]   Why do you think that happens?
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:30.100]   As chaotic as it is, as out of control and as rebellious as the world is, the scene up
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:34.580]   in heaven is not like that, right?
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:40.220]   So contrast the scene in heaven that we are shown with the scene that we see on earth.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.700]   Complete opposite, heaven and earth.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:50.500]   Earth is burning, the sea is turning into blood, a third of mankind is dying, people
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.100]   are in rebellion, they're killing the prophets of God.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:59.340]   I mean, the world is on fire, it's absolute utter chaos, antichrist is coming into power,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.860]   people are giving allegiance to the antichrist, and then the seventh trumpet blows and he
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.460]   gets a glimpse of heaven and what does he see in heaven?
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.380]   Worship, right?
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.660]   Worship, even in the midst of all of that, God is still on his throne.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.020]   24 elders are bowed down, prostrated, worshiping this God.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:25.860]   So no matter how chaotic this is here, like what does that tell us?
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.080]   God is still on his throne, he's still being worshipped.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.140]   God is still sovereign.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:37.140]   And that's the scene that God shows John and us, right, before he goes back to what's happening
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.140]   on earth.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.900]   This 24 elders, again, we see them prostrated before God.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.740]   Again, remember the word prostrated, proskuneo, is the most common word for worship in the
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.740]   New Testament.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.660]   It means to be utterly prostrated, right?
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:58.340]   The kind of thinking that we have of worship, we think of singing, we think of giving, we
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:03.540]   think of gathering, but the most common word in the New Testament for worship is being
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.540]   prostrated.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:11.420]   Like being in awe of something that is so beyond your imagination that you're just kind
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.820]   of lost, right, in the presence of God's glory.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.120]   And that's the scene that we see.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.380]   Every time we see a picture of worship in heaven, it's people who are affected by his
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:27.500]   glory and that's the scene that we see of the 24 elders, right?
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:35.580]   And the elders break out in prophecy, singing praise to the Father, and then he describes
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.340]   the judgment that's going to come and the great white throne judgment, the end time
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:46.460]   judgment that they are prophesying happens in Revelation chapter 20, 11 through 15, right?
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:52.520]   Then after the great white throne judgment, we get into chapter 21, which is the millennium
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   or eternity.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:05.720]   And we'll get to it when we get there, okay?
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:13.920]   And then it ends again, we get the vision takes us back to the temple and the temple
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.800]   is filled with the cloud signifying that he has filled the temple, right?
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.200]   He's taking all the measurements to renovate, to renew, to revive the church and in the
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:29.080]   midst of all of this chaos that the revival comes, persecution happens, right?
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.600]   Fear falls upon mankind, earthquake takes place, and then we see up in heaven, God is
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.480]   being worshiped, right?
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.040]   Just like before all of this happened.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:44.060]   And then the chapter ends with the restoration of the temple, right?
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.760]   And he looks into the temple and he sees the Ark of the Covenant that's inside restored,
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.680]   right?
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:58.000]   You guys ever – you guys watched the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.400]   Don't tell me you didn't watch that movie.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.120]   You watch Star Wars, you didn't watch Raiders of the Lost Ark?
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   Really?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   You guys didn't watch Raiders of the Lost Ark?
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   Okay.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.680]   Oh my gosh, all right.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.040]   That's a generation gap right there.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   All right.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.600]   Raiders – okay, I'm not even going to say it.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:23.020]   Basically that whole movie premise is going searching for the Ark of the Covenant, right?
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.680]   And the Ark of the Covenant is actually – no one knows exactly where it is.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.240]   There's actually a documentary where they try to trace it back and they found this one
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.480]   church and it's supposed to be in the basement but no one can get in there and the government
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   won't allow.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.900]   And there's a whole documentary but no one knows this for sure, right?
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.720]   So the Ark of the Covenant symbolized the covenant that God made with the nation of
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.600]   Israel, right?
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:53.200]   And it contains the tablets of God and Moses' rod and the manna and so all of it signifying
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.480]   God's covenant that he made with his people.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.320]   So when he says the Ark of the Covenant, he saw it back into the temple, means that God
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   remembers his covenant and he's restoring his promise that he made with his people.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.680]   And that's the scene that we're shown at the temple, that in the midst of all of this,
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.360]   before the final day comes, that God's promises, all of it is going to be fulfilled, right?
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.800]   That's the picture that we're shown here.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.520]   And that's what it means for the Ark of the Covenant to be in the temple, that his house,
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:30.080]   his presence among his people are going to be restored, right?
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.320]   So again, as we wrap up and I'm going to give you opportunity to take some time in your
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:46.080]   small group to discuss that as you're studying this, if even a portion of this makes sense,
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.160]   right?
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:55.000]   Even if a portion of it, even let's say about 10% of this that you believe is going to happen,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.840]   I don't know how it would not affect you, right?
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.140]   I don't know how this could not affect you.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:08.960]   I don't know how this could not affect the way you view life, the way you view what's
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.220]   valuable and what's not valuable, right?
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:18.660]   And I think that was the intention for the book of Revelation, not for us to figure out
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.420]   the details of how, when it's going to happen.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.300]   It's going to be seven years, it's going to be middle of the seven years or what the Antichrist
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.860]   is going to look like, all of that.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.780]   I think when it happens, you're going to remember a lot of things that you studied in the book
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.100]   of Revelation and say, "Oh, I remember this."
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.780]   Who knows, maybe two actual witnesses, two men are going to show up and they're going
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.300]   to actually be doing this and say, "Yeah, those two men are mentioned in Revelation
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   chapter 11."
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.540]   And when it happens, it won't catch you off guard like thieves, like thieves coming in
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.940]   the night.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:54.280]   So maybe God placed enough in the scripture about the end times so that when it happens,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.460]   you're going to know, right, if you've been paying attention.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:03.400]   But prior to that, everything that we see in the book of Revelation is for the purpose
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:12.860]   of making an imprint, a deep imprint that the end is coming, that this is not a guess.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.520]   This is not God's wishful thinking.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:22.660]   This is human history coming to an end, saying that this is where the end is going to happen.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:28.240]   So however it happens, whatever the timeline that it happens, the end is certain.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.740]   Victory in Christ is certain.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.100]   Judgment upon sin is certain.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.900]   Eternity in Christ is certain.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.620]   Sovereignty of God and worship is certain.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.540]   The end of the world as we, you and I know it, is certain.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:48.060]   We don't know exactly when, we don't know exactly how, but it's absolutely certain,
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.260]   right?
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.420]   So how does that affect us?
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.740]   How does that affect what we pursue?
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.300]   How does that affect what we value?
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:04.300]   And so as I've been saying on Sunday, if we take our faith even somewhat seriously,
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:11.420]   it should at least cause us to take a step back and cause us to examine, if this has
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:17.460]   absolutely no effect on you, why not?
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.300]   At the minimum, we should be asking that question, right?
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.780]   Let me go over the discussion questions real quick.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.180]   The Lord prepares His coming by restoring His glory to the church.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.460]   In what way can we contribute to this restoration?
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.860]   How can this be applied personally rather than thinking what others should be doing?
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:39.060]   So again, don't discuss like, "Yeah, the church should be like this," or "Those people should
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.060]   be like that."
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.420]   How can we contribute to the restoration of the church, revival?
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   Number two, we collectively, individually are called to be light of the world.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.580]   In what way are you actively shining your light?
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.700]   Okay, I think that's pretty straightforward.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.980]   Number three, what traits do you think the Antichrist will have to be able to recognize
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.460]   that he's not from God?
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.820]   Obviously, he's not going to be wearing a hat that says "Antichrist."
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.500]   He's going to be coming to deceive, right?
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:10.140]   And if he's very powerful, which the Bible says he is, and he's very deceptive, meaning
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:17.580]   a lot – he said even if – his deception is going to be so powerful that even the elect
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.340]   may get deceived, if that was possible.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.340]   In other words, it's not possible, meaning there's going to be a lot of people that you
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.820]   thought were elect are going to be deceived and find out that they weren't elect.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.900]   The real elect are going to persevere, but that's how severe this delusion is going to
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.000]   be, right?
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.020]   Even the people who withstood other stuff, that when the Antichrist comes and he deceives,
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.100]   he's going to be very successful.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.160]   So how are you going to recognize that, right?
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.940]   How would you be able to tell between false prophets and true prophets sent from God,
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:52.820]   knowing that deception is often internal rather than external, right?
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.620]   Deception typically happens inside, right?
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:03.820]   It's not simply because, "Oh, here's 15 marks of who is and who is not from God."
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:12.540]   Typically, the way deception happens is we can be doing God's work for ungodly reasons.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:19.180]   We can stand up for truth, for pride, for self-ambition, right?
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.940]   So deception happens internally.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.400]   That's why the Scripture says that the Word of God is able to judge the thoughts and intentions
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   of our heart.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.700]   It doesn't just judge the thoughts and intentions of all the spirits.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.300]   It judges the thoughts and intentions of our hearts, right?
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:41.420]   So if we're not regularly in the Word of God, we can be pursuing righteousness with a deceived
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.860]   heart, right?
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:47.380]   So I think it's important not only do we recognize external signs that the Scripture says, but
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.980]   how do we make sure that we are not being deceived, right?
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.340]   Because every single one of us is susceptible to that, and that's what we're warned.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.860]   So how can we identify this?
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:01.540]   Number four, our spiritual battle is directly linked to our prayer life.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:06.060]   Without prayer, we may have all the best intentions but still be very susceptible to deception.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.180]   In what practical way can you improve your discipline of prayer?
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.300]   Ultimately, it's a spiritual battle, so if we're going to engage in the spiritual battle,
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.420]   we need to be on our knees, right?
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.500]   So let's take some time with our small groups and discuss the questions.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:24.380]   And again, I want to encourage you next week, the questions on there is mainly for the purpose
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.820]   of review.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:31.740]   And then, yeah, and then, so if you have people who weren't able to come up today and they
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:35.580]   missed and they feel kind of lost, next week will be a good time for them to come at all
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.580]   costs, okay?
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:43.740]   Let me pray for us, and then I'll have you guys get into your group.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:50.180]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for the opportunity for your church to come together.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.580]   I pray, Father God, for your continued grace.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.420]   Every single one of us, Lord God, we wrestle with being entangled, distracted.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:06.220]   Lord, eternal things, Lord, that at times when we're not sober, it just doesn't seem
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.220]   that important.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:13.700]   But I pray that your word, that you would cause our hearts to be softened, our eyes
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:18.220]   to be sharpened, and our ears to be open, Lord God, to your word.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:23.820]   And all the warnings and encouragements would continue to strengthen your church, that we
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.460]   would wait eagerly, Lord God, and that we would not be caught off guard when the end
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.840]   time begins to unravel.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.860]   So I pray for our church, I pray for our discussion, that you would help us to be fruitful in all
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.820]   that we do. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
