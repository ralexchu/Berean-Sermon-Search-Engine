[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.120]   the authorship and recipient parts of the First Corinthians,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.560]   there's a little segment on methodology.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.960]   I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.820]   but I want to explain to you,
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.560]   when we say that we want to do an inductive study,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.560]   what we're saying is we want to go through
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.600]   the necessary due diligence process
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.880]   of observing all there is to observe of the passage,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.200]   of appropriately interpreting the things that we observe,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.240]   and doing a thorough study as to apply it, okay?
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.560]   So that being the case, with observation,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.080]   we want to make sure that we take it verse by verse.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.140]   We want to make sure that we're not just skipping over
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.360]   huge chunks of things, why?
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760]   Because there can be another approach we take,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.960]   which is what I did when we did the Psalm study,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.440]   a devotional study.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.840]   How is it different?
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   When I did a devotional study,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.760]   I studied the passages and decided,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.400]   in this Psalm that's typically pretty huge,
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   I saw major themes and movements.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.320]   Because it was repetitive,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840]   because there were things that were emphasized,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.520]   I just used those major points to give you a devotion,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.960]   to give you something to meditate
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.920]   and pray about for your life.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.440]   That's very different from saying,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.760]   verse one, here's what it says, what is it?
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.380]   Verse two, this is what it is, what is that?
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.400]   And you're asking all these questions
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.900]   about every element of that entire passage.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.360]   You see the difference?
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.400]   We can also take a topical study,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.220]   which we've done in our previous Bible studies,
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.920]   where we say, hey, we want to talk about counseling.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160]   We want to talk about hurt and pain.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.120]   What does the Bible have to say about that?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.640]   You see how that's a different approach
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.040]   than saying, we're gonna work through this passage,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.040]   follow its trail of thought,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.600]   we're gonna observe all that it has to say to us, right?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.980]   So by nature, we're gonna take smaller chunks,
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.000]   typically no more than 10 verses,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.880]   and we're going to do an in-depth study, okay?
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.120]   Any questions about that?
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.600]   All right.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.640]   Nonetheless, our study is truly for the purpose
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.800]   of our growth, our spiritual growth,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.120]   both in understanding and practice.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.080]   So we do have to have moments when we're sitting here
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   asking ourselves, how do I now evaluate myself
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.680]   against what I'm studying, you know?
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680]   And that's gonna be a necessary part of our study,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   and I hope you guys can do that,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   more so in your discussion time.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.040]   And obviously, I'm gonna bring up certain points
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.600]   in the study, okay?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.080]   But one of the things that we really have to commit to
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.400]   is to do homework, okay?
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.040]   Reason being is because if we literally pause at each word
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800]   and we sat there and just tried to dig,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.760]   put a stake down and dig at each element,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.040]   we can be in 1 Corinthians for like three years.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   So that being the case, you're gonna notice
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.480]   that I'm gonna assign homework for every single time,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.560]   and I'm gonna try to make sure that the homework
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.160]   is both useful and that the homework is also reviewed.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   That way, we hold each other accountable,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.040]   and also we don't feel like we're just doing busy work, okay?
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.640]   All right, so we covered the nature of our class.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   Again, for small group-wise, the groups that you're in,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   these are just kind of mutual discussion groups,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.800]   sharing application, all right?
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.720]   Lastly, one of the things that we do with each Bible study
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.440]   is we collect $5 from each individual.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.280]   This is for the purpose of covering some of the costs,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.120]   and from the money that we receive,
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560]   I'm gonna purchase, I think I'm gonna purchase
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.120]   the binders for you guys,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.560]   and it covers the cost of snacks.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.840]   So I'm gonna pass around a little snack sign-up sheet,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.320]   and I apologize about the lines.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.080]   If you guys have lines all through your thing,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   something happened with the printer today,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240]   and I couldn't get it fixed.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.480]   So I'm gonna pass this around along with the pouch, okay?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.200]   Pouch is for your phone holders,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280]   and then this is for the snack sign-up.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.560]   Cool thing is, the Collegians contacted me and said,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.680]   in the month of May, every single week in the month of May,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.160]   they're gonna serve us snacks.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   I said, wow, better be good, nugget.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   (laughing)
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.720]   I said, we're used to sushi, nugget.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.840]   I said, you know, I told them, okay, cool.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.320]   So I already blocked off the month of May,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.920]   but if you guys would sign up for the other months,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.640]   that'd be much appreciated.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.760]   Because then, even though we're still,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.840]   the Collegians are covering that,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   I'm still gonna give them a portion of what we collect,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.120]   so that it kinda covers, 'cause I'm not exactly
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.560]   how they're gonna do the finance,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.720]   but also, if you decide to sign up for doing snacks,
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.320]   obviously, this is a large group,
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.120]   and to do snacks, it's gonna be quite a big sum,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.560]   so we're also gonna compensate
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.360]   some of the money for the snacks, too.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.040]   All right, so I'm gonna start this over here.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800]   If you guys can make sure that it kinda goes all around,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.040]   that'd be appreciated, okay?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.000]   Oh, this one, too, all right.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.680]   And there's change in there if you need.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   You can kinda open up the envelope.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.080]   All right.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.360]   Good.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.800]   Then, let's pray, and then we'll jump into
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.720]   the study of 1 Corinthians, okay?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   All right, let's pray together.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.800]   Heavenly Father, we ask God
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040]   that you would thoroughly bless our time.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.640]   Lord, we thank you for the study
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.520]   that we're about to engage in.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.560]   We thank you for your truth that's given to us.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.440]   God, help us truly to be good students,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.920]   children who are receptive of your instruction.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.160]   God, as we study a book that has many exhortations,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.760]   rebuke and corrections, I pray, Father God,
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.920]   that these things all would be precious convictions for us,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.640]   that, God, we might live in the light,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.840]   God, that we might live in obedience to you.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.640]   Lord, we thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.480]   Okay.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.880]   All right.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.760]   So, I wanna start off, actually,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.080]   by talking a little bit about the first verses of this book.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.040]   Okay?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.520]   So, we're gonna actually skip the authorship recipient stuff
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.440]   for a little bit later today,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.640]   but let's turn in your Bibles
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.400]   to 1 Corinthians, chapter one.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.480]   Arnold, if you wanna join a group,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.600]   sorry, I noticed you standing there.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.560]   You can join this one here.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   There's empty chairs in this group.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.760]   Kind of small with three guys.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.600]   Also,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.800]   Christine.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.680]   Is that you, Christine?
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.600]   My eyes are so bad.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.960]   (laughs)
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.520]   If you can just join whatever group you want.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.360]   All right.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.200]   (laughs)
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Okay.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.560]   Let's start here in 1 Corinthians, chapter one.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.960]   And I'm gonna read for us verses one through nine.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.000]   And it says,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.960]   Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.480]   by the will of God,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.400]   and Sothony is our brother,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.320]   to the church of God, which is at Corinth,
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.120]   to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.880]   saints by calling,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   with all who in every place
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.560]   call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.960]   their Lord and ours.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.240]   Grace to you and peace from God our Father
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.440]   and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.400]   I thank my God always concerning you
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.440]   for the grace of God,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.480]   which was given you in Christ Jesus,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.760]   that in everything you are enriched in him,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.960]   in all speech and all knowledge,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   even as the testimony concerning Christ
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.800]   was confirmed in you,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.320]   so that you are not lacking in any gift,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.480]   waiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.280]   who will also confirm you to the end,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.360]   blameless in a day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.120]   God is faithful through whom you were called
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   into the fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.440]   Okay?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.960]   All right.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.720]   Now, as we look at that,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   again, the whole idea for us is
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.280]   we wanna make sure that we observe all that we can.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.880]   We wanna make sure that we observe
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.000]   things that are relevant,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.160]   things that are meaningful to us, okay?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.800]   And so I actually wanna start off,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.520]   start off by asking you something that occurs in verse one.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.680]   Okay?
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.040]   Something that happens in verse one
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.800]   is Apostle Paul introduces himself,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.160]   and as a casual reading, you might be thinking,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.200]   this is how Apostle Paul always introduces himself.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.720]   Well, actually, the truth of the matter is
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.240]   Apostle Paul does not always introduce himself in this way.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.760]   Okay?
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.320]   Very emphatically, Apostle Paul calls attention
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.080]   to the fact that he is an apostle.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.920]   Okay?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.120]   So he says, "Called an apostle of Jesus Christ
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.160]   "by the will of God and Sosthenes, our brother."
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.720]   So, if you would just jot down really quickly,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.040]   maybe just in number one,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.920]   that Apostle Paul is both emphasizing his apostleship
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.280]   to the fact that he's describing it as a calling from God,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.480]   but also by way of the language he placed it in Greek,
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.760]   he emphasizes the fact that he is an apostle.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   Okay?
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.040]   But here's a question for you.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.280]   Why would an individual,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.120]   when they're writing a letter to a church
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.160]   or anybody who's beloved,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.680]   feel the need to assert their title?
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.840]   Okay?
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.680]   So think about that for a moment,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.360]   and any guesses are welcome,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.520]   any thoughts that you have are welcome.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.840]   Please, you know, just raise your hand
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.440]   and let's have some participation from the group.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.920]   Okay?
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.320]   So as we read the first verse,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.040]   what would be a reason why Apostle Paul
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.800]   would feel the need to assert,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.360]   I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ?
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.200]   (audience member shouts)
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.040]   Yes.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.000]   Great.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.880]   To assert his authority, okay?
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.520]   To assert his authority.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.160]   By saying that he is an apostle,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.560]   he is truly an individual
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.480]   who is a first authority in the church,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.520]   as a founder of the church, okay?
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.240]   Apostle Paul actually founded this church.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.960]   So he is asserting his authority definitely
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.920]   by calling himself an apostle.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.200]   But we could ask even further.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.600]   So yes, he's asserting his authority
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.040]   and that's what people do when they say,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.360]   I'm the boss, you know?
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.560]   But why would you feel the need to do that?
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:22.600]   One more time?
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.200]   To defend, great.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.120]   So if you guys are taking notes,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   please put that in there.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.560]   So one of 'em, I think I have four blanks in there,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   one of 'em is the authority.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.720]   And the next one is to defend.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.560]   One of 'em is to defend.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   Apostle Paul, throughout his ministry,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.400]   has experienced so much opposition.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.960]   There are false teachers,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.480]   there are groups of people
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.400]   who constantly say, wait a minute,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.720]   weren't you a persecutor of the church?
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.480]   Wait a minute, what do you know about the gospel?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.560]   You know?
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.320]   And they're constantly bashing,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.400]   diminishing the authority that he has.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.640]   So definitely there's a sense in which
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.160]   Apostle Paul needs to defend himself.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.760]   As a matter of fact, if you read
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.520]   a book of 2 Corinthians,
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.040]   a huge chunk of that book
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.960]   is a defense of his apostleship, okay?
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.160]   What's another reason why?
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.400]   Can you think of any other reasons
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.000]   why Apostle Paul would feel the need
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   to assert his authority,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.200]   to assert his authority and introduce the letter with,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.280]   I am an apostle?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.440]   (silence)
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:42.320]   Keep thinking.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.200]   All right, so the one that,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.880]   there's a couple more,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.200]   but I think it's important to say is because,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.560]   as you guys know,
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.880]   if you guys have read 1 Corinthians before,
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.000]   there's a sense in which he needs to assert that authority
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.040]   because of the state of the people he's speaking to.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.080]   So you can write in the brief,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.160]   the state of the church, right?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.520]   There's a sense in which,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.160]   if the people already were really receptive,
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.560]   and not only were they receptive,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.400]   they were, come on, Apostle Paul,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.200]   come on over, you know, we miss you,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.640]   I can't believe you're away and you're traveling
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.880]   and you're doing all this mission work,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.400]   we've so long to see you.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.160]   Do you think he would need to come in with,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.040]   I'm an apostle representing God, you know?
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.840]   No, he wouldn't, right?
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.320]   And so, in line with that,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.840]   by the state of the church,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.440]   I wanna talk about the background, okay?
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.080]   The background of the church.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.720]   So we're not gonna read the whole paragraph
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.160]   that's there about the authorship
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.920]   and recipients of the church,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.360]   but I wanna give you just kind of the description
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.160]   of the land, description of the people,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.200]   as much as I can.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.680]   And I wanted to place it within our study
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.360]   because I wanted to show you
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.560]   that background information and historical information
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.160]   are actually really, really useful
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.600]   in elaborating the picture of what's happening, okay?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.400]   So, the city of Corinth.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.880]   What's really interesting about the city of Corinth
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.920]   is that for a long time,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.720]   it was the epicenter of commerce,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.880]   it was a heavily traveled trade route, okay?
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.440]   I have a map for you guys there,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.840]   a bigger map kinda showing you generally where it is,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.280]   where in Greece,
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.800]   but a closer map showing you
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.080]   that there was actually two gulfs
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.400]   meeting with a small strip of land.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.600]   And so you can imagine,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.080]   anybody who wanted to go through,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.000]   who didn't wanna go all the way around
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.200]   that region of Achaia,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.160]   what would they do?
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.480]   They would land on one side
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.440]   and they would go through Corinth, okay?
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.680]   So that being the case,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.560]   Corinth was always a really important region in the area.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.120]   But the thing about it was,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.920]   you can imagine anywhere where there's high traffic,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.440]   anywhere there's a lot of different people coming,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.960]   there would be also a lot of different religions.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.360]   What's really crazy about Corinth
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.720]   is that it was one of these unique cities
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   that had over 10 monumental, huge temples to idols, okay?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.880]   So I think I have a picture there of one of the temples,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.480]   that temple is the temple for Apollos, okay?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.760]   So here you have a city that's high in commerce,
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.080]   high in probably entertainment,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.240]   and high in idol worship.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.200]   But the thing about it is,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.840]   almost all the cities I feel like,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.360]   if you ever read the background information
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.920]   about any of the cities the New Testament talks about,
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.960]   it's always like that.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.400]   There's a lot of people going through
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.880]   and there's a lot of idolatry.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.840]   That's what it feels like, right?
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   But what I wanna mention to you
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.200]   is Corinth was particularly special.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.760]   Because Corinth eventually became,
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.160]   by the time the church was established,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.320]   Corinth became the capital, okay?
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.320]   Corinth was not only the capital,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.240]   but Corinth had a high city in the capital,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.480]   which is called the Anacropolis or something like that, okay?
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.560]   And so if you can imagine,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.160]   it's like the pinnacle of all of that kind of idolatry
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.720]   and all that kind of trade and all that kind of movement.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.920]   If you think about it,
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.720]   if in our day and age,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.480]   you think of where do people go
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.120]   to just have parties and debauchery?
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.440]   Vegas.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.280]   If you go to Vegas,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.760]   there's trade shows coming in,
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.960]   there's electronic shows,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.600]   there's rodeos,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.360]   there's all sorts of people.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.040]   And all sorts of people go there
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.120]   to have a bunch of fun, right?
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.960]   And then when you say Vegas,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   you automatically also associate that with
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.280]   sin.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.040]   So much so that even some of the early pagan writers,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.520]   I'm talking about people like even like Aristotle
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.000]   and stuff like that, early writers,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.800]   they would mention that Corinth,
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.960]   and if they said, "Oh, she's a Corinth girl,"
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.760]   that meant she was a prostitute.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.280]   If they wanted to bag on somebody
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.560]   and they would just want to use a term
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.640]   like you've been affected by this,
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   you've been tainted by this,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.160]   they actually had a term,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.320]   I don't think I wrote it down in your notes,
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.240]   but it was,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.880]   let's see here.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.320]   Okay, it's called Corinthazesthai,
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   which literally is to be Corinthianized or something, right?
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.960]   So you can imagine,
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.080]   for the non-Christian world
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.160]   to talk about Corinth like that,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.600]   it was probably even worse than Vegas, right?
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.760]   It's like that.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.400]   So that's the kind of environment
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.240]   that was there,
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.360]   but the thing about it was,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.080]   it was really, really odd
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.600]   because there was a huge contingency of the Jews.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.880]   When the Romans came in power,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.440]   a lot of the Romans did not like the Jews,
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.560]   and so as the Romans were squashing the Jews
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.000]   out of certain cities,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.720]   many of the people, many of the Jews,
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.160]   ran away to Corinth.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.600]   So here you have a city that's pagan as can be,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.760]   but it also have huge contingencies of Jewish people, okay?
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.000]   Why do we talk about that?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.440]   Why is this background important?
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.640]   Because the Corinthian church,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.200]   as established by Apostle Paul,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.600]   he spent a year and a half there
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.880]   converting people,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.440]   gathering the church together,
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.840]   teaching them, and all sorts,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.320]   but they were so affected by their surroundings
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.800]   that much of the world existed in the church, okay?
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.960]   So you can imagine,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.120]   Apostle Paul is writing to this church.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.600]   He's currently in Ephesus,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.240]   having received a letter and report
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.360]   about what's going on in Corinth,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   and so you can imagine Apostle Paul,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.800]   it's like a father who's been away for some time,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.480]   coming to find out that his kids,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.920]   that his kids are ripe with evil, wicked,
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.760]   all kinds of sin,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.400]   all kinds of immorality,
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.440]   all kinds of strife,
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.560]   and so he's coming in wanting to say,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.920]   look, I'm about to speak to you,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.280]   and I'm speaking as one who is representing God.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.360]   I'm speaking as one with great authority.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.400]   I'm an apostle called by Jesus Christ,
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.000]   not by my own will,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.160]   but by the will of God, okay?
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.680]   That's what's happening.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.240]   So again, in verse one, as we see,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.080]   Apostle Paul says,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.920]   "Called an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,"
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.640]   and it mentions in Sothenes, our brother.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.240]   Sothenes, he's an interesting character
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.000]   because in Acts chapter 18,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.280]   it reveals that Sothenes was actually the leader
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.080]   in the synagogue.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.360]   So this individual, this individual,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.320]   was actually an appointed of the gospel.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.680]   He was a Jew who was not just a regular Jew,
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.360]   but a leader amongst the Jews.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.720]   What's pretty amazing is,
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.600]   Apostle Paul, who also was a leader amongst the Jews
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.920]   and appointed of the gospel,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.400]   is now writing to them with authority
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.060]   with another individual who's been converted, okay?
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.200]   All right.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.920]   Now, in thinking about that,
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.480]   as you read, kinda, if you guys can,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.480]   take a look at that whole passage again, okay?
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.800]   Take a look at the whole passage again.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.240]   So Apostle Paul, laying down his authority,
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.640]   laying down his right to speak,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.520]   laying down and asserting the kind of,
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.360]   you know, perhaps the foundation
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.400]   that he requires to speak great truth.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.320]   He's speaking to the church,
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.480]   but as you kind of evaluate what he is saying
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.280]   in the next verses,
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   can you try to identify what are some things he repeats?
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.720]   What are some things that appear multiple times
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.400]   in this short paragraph,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.480]   or the couple paragraphs,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.340]   verses one through nine?
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.640]   So if you want to take a moment
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.360]   just to scan down the whole thing again.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.760]   Scan it through and then please let me know
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.380]   what you see as repetitions in the passage.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.540]   (silence)
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:12.420]   Yes?
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.580]   - [Audience Member] He talks about being called.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.740]   - Great, okay.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.140]   He talks about being called multiple times.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.580]   Please jot that into the second line, okay?
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.460]   Please jot that into the second line.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.420]   We'll talk about that in just a moment, okay?
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.580]   He's being called.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.820]   What's another thing that's repeated many, many times
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.940]   that perhaps we're not like pointing
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.800]   because it's always repeated many, many times?
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.780]   There you go.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.580]   The Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.100]   The name of God, right?
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.820]   So these are two important things
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.860]   that we just want to recognize here.
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.740]   That yes, the name of Christ, you know,
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.700]   the Lord Jesus Christ, or Savior,
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.820]   and all that kind of stuff in other passages are repeated.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820]   Here is Christ Jesus, God, Christ Jesus again,
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.940]   and Christ, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.940]   and it just keeps repeating the Lord
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.240]   again and again and again, okay?
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.940]   We started thinking about that a little bit
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.460]   because it's not just a way,
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.600]   kind of maybe how we do it.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.800]   You know, I know that for me, I'm personally okay with it,
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.900]   but I know some people have a problem with it
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   where you pray and you're like,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.060]   Father God, Father God, Father God,
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.900]   and you just kind of say his name multiple times, right?
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.180]   Some people have a lot of problem with it.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.940]   For me, actually, it's okay if that's the way,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.100]   you know, you've been kind of accustomed to pray,
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.580]   and you're praying like that.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.120]   For me, it's okay, right?
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.860]   But the thing about it is, when Apostle Paul does it,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.660]   it's not for no reason but just to fill her.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.940]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.180]   There's a reason behind it.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.700]   So let me ask you this question.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.820]   There are two things he's repeating multiple times.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.120]   One is the Lord.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.660]   Second is the calling,
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.140]   and if you guys can fill that in a little bit more
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.460]   and say calling as saints, okay, calling as saints.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.380]   But I ask you this question.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.960]   Given the context that we've already set up,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.060]   we said that the church, mimicking the world,
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.380]   being heavily influenced by all the gross immorality
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.780]   that's around them, and Apostle Paul is coming
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.300]   and speaking to them in authority,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.620]   what would be his motive and reason
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.740]   for bringing up those two things?
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.680]   Let's start with Jesus Christ.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.840]   (silence)
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:45.120]   I feel like you were gonna say something
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   and then you're like.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.280]   (inhales)
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.320]   (laughs)
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.080]   Yeah, no?
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.920]   The question.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.320]   (laughs)
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.080]   Sorry, I put you on the spot, okay.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   The question is, yeah, he's beginning this letter
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.280]   and he's repeating actually the name of the Lord
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.720]   many times, not just like once or twice,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.480]   but throughout the entire thing,
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   his whole introduction, almost every verse.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.320]   Why?
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.160]   - To
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.480]   make note of them, or make sure that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.760]   - Okay.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.600]   Okay, he wants to make emphatically clear
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.320]   that Jesus Christ is the Lord of them, that kind of thing?
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.680]   Okay, good.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.560]   What else, yes?
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.280]   - To me, that Christ is foundational
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.880]   to everything else we can say,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.840]   and to some of the issues that are struggled with,
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.840]   and perhaps in part due to getting without Christ.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.080]   - Good, okay.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.880]   So, Dr. David was saying Christ is foundational,
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.520]   and as they're living in our morality,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.160]   they need to realize that their sins
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.360]   connects back foundationally to either knowing Christ
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.880]   or not knowing him well, right?
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.840]   And so, yeah, if you think about it,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.520]   the foundation, and I almost think about it this way,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.160]   perhaps the greatest way to convict them,
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.920]   the greatest way to shake them up
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   would be to remind them of their relationship with Christ,
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.120]   you know?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.880]   Because if Christ is supposed to be the greatest love,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.000]   if Christ is supposed to be the greatest, most important,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.600]   most precious, most valuable thing in their lives,
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.120]   then that would be the first thing
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.480]   that he would lay as a foundation
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   of why they need to repent,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.640]   of why they need to return, right?
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.080]   he could use arguments of,
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.200]   hey, this is not beneficial for you.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.840]   He can use arguments of,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.680]   hey, this is only gonna lead to ruin,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.240]   you know, 'cause we do that in our strategy, don't we?
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.720]   In our strategy, don't we use arguments of,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.160]   like, hey, this isn't good for you.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.560]   When I teach my children, I use that.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.800]   When I teach other people, they use that.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.560]   But sometimes, that's not the most convicting thing.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.960]   The most convicting thing is that
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.160]   the core identity of who you are,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.400]   you are in a relationship with the Lord.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.680]   And if that's in danger, if that's been severed,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.080]   that's going to be the biggest point of conviction,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.240]   their identity in Christ.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.000]   That's foundational.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.720]   And so, it goes hand in hand
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.320]   that he would talk about their calling, okay?
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.160]   So,
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.320]   the second thing that I had you guys write is
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.000]   their calling as saints.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.520]   So, we see, noticed here,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.000]   like, he talks about his own calling,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.920]   but in verse two, he says,
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.760]   "To the church of God, which is at Corinth,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.280]   to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.240]   saints by calling."
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.060]   And then, if you look down in verse nine, he says,
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.120]   "God is faithful through whom you were called
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.560]   and to fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord."
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.400]   Okay?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.240]   So,
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.480]   that is surprising.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.520]   It's surprising, why?
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   Because the church is very far from being saints, right?
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   It's surprising that he would call them saints,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.160]   and he says, "I'm speaking to you, saints."
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.720]   You know?
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.800]   If we were in a conversation,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.480]   and an individual was talking to you
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.920]   and trying to correct you about something you did,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.440]   and you were sitting there thinking,
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.720]   "Oh, yeah, that was so stupid, that was so dumb of me,"
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.480]   and then they said, "Yeah, smart guy."
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.680]   Would that be received as, like,
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.440]   would that be received really well?
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.000]   But is that the reason why he said that?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.080]   Almost as a sarcastic tone, it was like,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.240]   "Okay, saints," you know?
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.500]   It wasn't a sarcastic tone.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.680]   The way that Apostle Paul was saying this, truly,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   was a way to call them back to their identity in Christ,
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.700]   which is, "In Christ, you are saints."
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.300]   The truth of the matter is that when they're in Christ,
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.940]   they are saints because they are set apart from him.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.700]   Saints literally means holy ones, okay?
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.580]   So, jot that in there as your notes.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.100]   Saints literally means holy ones, okay?
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.740]   So, the Greek word for holy and the one for saints
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.540]   are just derivatives of each other.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.340]   They're holy ones.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.860]   They're set apart.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.900]   They're consecrated and ordained.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.060]   And they've been done so by God himself.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.500]   And so, as you guys know,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.560]   the way in which God sees us when we are in Christ
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.340]   is that in the moment God has called us effectually,
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.700]   then God has called us to be separate from him.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.220]   We're categorically different.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.760]   And so, the Corinthians church,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.900]   although they were far from being saintly in practice,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.700]   they needed to realize that in standing before God,
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.540]   this is who they are.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.940]   I'm not gonna jump the gun yet,
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.100]   but later I'm gonna ask,
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.100]   so you see Apostle Paul's strategy?
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.840]   He's gonna bring them back to foundationally
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.020]   to their relationship with Christ.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.620]   And he's gonna bring them back foundationally
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.300]   to this is who you are.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.380]   This is what God has called you to.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.660]   And all the exhortation,
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.340]   all the commands that come after that
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.660]   is gonna be founded upon that ground.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.840]   But moving forward,
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.380]   if we take a look at verses three
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.980]   down all the way to verse eight,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.220]   it's a huge middle section
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.220]   that Apostle Paul spends a lot of time describing them.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.980]   And so, I wanna ask you this question.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.900]   What is Apostle Paul's attitude
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.020]   towards the Corinthians church in this passage?
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.140]   So, kinda again, I want you guys to reread
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.380]   verses two through eight,
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.900]   and please answer that question for us.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.240]   What is Apostle Paul's attitude towards the church?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.000]   (pages rustling)
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:14.760]   Mm, very good.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.080]   He says just flat out in verse four,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.560]   I thank my God always concerning you
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.840]   for the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.120]   So, underneath question number three,
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.880]   I believe I have two blanks again.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.320]   The first one, please write it in
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.120]   that he is very thankful for them.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.600]   You know?
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   I think, just as a side note,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.860]   you see Apostle Paul's heart, right?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:44.060]   Apostle Paul actually spent the most amount of time
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.520]   with the Corinthians.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.560]   You know, there are some churches
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.640]   Apostle Paul only had three months with.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.560]   There are only some churches
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.160]   he only visited for a short time.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.360]   And then there are churches he never got to visit, okay?
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.880]   But nonetheless, with the Corinthians,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.240]   he spent a great amount of time.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.280]   He toiled with them.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.480]   He labored with them.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.520]   He even sent more people towards them.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.160]   And he probably wrote more than just two letters to them.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.520]   But that being the case, they were frustrating.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.960]   Can you imagine if you invested all your time,
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.160]   you sacrificed, you risked your life,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.040]   and in the end, they just didn't bear the kind of fruit?
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.880]   You know?
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.760]   Typically speaking, you would be tempted to be like,
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.960]   forget you guys, you know?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.880]   Just do your own thing.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.840]   Just do whatever the heck you want, you know?
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.680]   But Apostle Paul was very thankful for them.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.240]   And Apostle Paul, still nonetheless,
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.320]   if you look at verse three, says,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.440]   grace to you and peace.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.600]   Grace to you and peace.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   He wishes them well.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.920]   That's his attitude.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.760]   But what's another perspective Apostle Paul
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.520]   has about this church?
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.200]   What's his attitude towards them?
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   He treats them like what?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.880]   Like children, like Christians.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.400]   Like fellow believers in Christ.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.600]   I think one of the things that I was surprised by
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.680]   is, you know, most of us, many of us,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.960]   have probably read 1 Corinthians before.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.240]   And we realize 1 Corinthians is an entire book
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.120]   about problems.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.720]   An entire book about like the number of different problems.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.280]   And some of them were really grotesque.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.480]   Some of them were unmentionable.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.600]   Some of them, Apostle Paul himself says,
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.840]   even the pagans don't do that.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.160]   I'm like, gosh, you know?
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.720]   But the way he addresses them is,
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   he addresses them like brothers.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.520]   He addresses them like believers.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.360]   I think his attitude towards them is,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.600]   he treats them like they're saved.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.440]   So if you look at the way he talks to them,
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.480]   when not only is he thinking of their best interest
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   in verse three, where he says,
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.520]   grace to you and peace from God our Father
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.280]   and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.800]   You say grace to you and peace from God our Father
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.160]   and the Lord Jesus Christ, not to pagans.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.040]   You know, that might sound like too rigid or harsh,
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.960]   but you actually don't say that to people
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.920]   who don't have grace, who don't have peace of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.760]   Why?
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.480]   Because the kind of peace he's wishing them
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.320]   is the only peace that comes from the only Savior
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.960]   and Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.240]   That kind of peace is only a fruit of the grace of God.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.320]   And so as he's talking to them,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.920]   look at all the stuff he says to the church of God,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.560]   which is important, to those who have been sanctified
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.720]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.280]   In my mind, when you say to somebody,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.240]   you've been sanctified in Christ Jesus,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.480]   that's an exclusively Christian term.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.840]   You know?
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.800]   In other books of the Bible,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.600]   he's mentioned people who try to do good.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.480]   He mentioned people who try to be in the church
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.800]   or in the synagogue and stuff like that.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.240]   That's not an exclusively Christian term.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.960]   But when he says, you're in Christ,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.040]   you're sanctified in him,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.000]   he has an attitude towards them.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.120]   You are a Christian.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.880]   And so he says, "Saints, by calling with all
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.360]   "who in every place call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   "their Lord and ours."
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.260]   He says, "I thank my God always concerning you
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.200]   "for the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus."
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.240]   So the way he's talking about them
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.360]   is he's talking to them generally as a church of God,
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.680]   generally as those who are Christian and saved.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.160]   And I think, again, that kind of goes to show
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   Apostle Paul's perspective, his attitude.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.800]   His attitude is not so much dependent and determined
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.160]   by simply the performance of the people.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.880]   Apostle Paul beautifully always has a very spiritual eye
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.080]   when he looks at people,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.840]   and he always has a bigger perspective
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.360]   which God is always in control of.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.400]   And we're gonna see that a little bit more right now.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.640]   If you guys can, on your packet,
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.140]   just put the whole block verse in there.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.960]   Because some people,
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.680]   I don't know if any of you guys are like this,
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.440]   but some people really hate marking their Bibles.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.800]   For me, I mark my Bible all the way up,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.940]   but if you don't like it, that's why I put that in there,
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.720]   I would like you guys to please circle or underline
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   or however you do it, mark every major verb
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.440]   starting from verse two through eight.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   That is one of the ways you can observe
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.620]   the scriptures very carefully, okay?
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.320]   I asked you already to observe repeated words.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.100]   I asked you to observe like attitudes and so forth
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.560]   because those are important.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:13.360]   But I also want you to mark every single verb that you see.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.200]   Okay?
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.080]   So go ahead and take time to do that.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.160]   Mark every verb.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.320]   (silence)
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:44.340]   From verse two through eight.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.500]   (silence)
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.240]   (marker clatters)
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.000]   (marker clatters)
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.760]   (marker clatters)
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.520]   (marker clatters)
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.360]   (marker clatters)
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:12.200]   (marker clatters)
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   Okay.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.040]   (marker clatters)
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.400]   So,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:40.080]   observations about these verses, verses two through eight,
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.480]   what are some observations that you guys see
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.820]   from just going through perusing down these verbs?
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.200]   It can be something obvious.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.280]   Some observations are literally obvious
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.540]   because all you're doing is seeing what's in there.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.060]   You can talk about some obvious ones,
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.720]   or you can maybe find a similarity
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.880]   behind some of the things that he's saying.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.240]   What do you guys see?
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:16.340]   Like what is he doing with these verbs, so to speak?
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:25.140]   (audience member speaks)
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.980]   (Marker clatters)
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.400]   Okay.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.060]   Great, okay.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.680]   So, he said that just for,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.760]   there are people viewing on the internet and stuff,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.440]   he said that there are the verbs confirmed
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.200]   that's repeated a few times,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.680]   and it gives the idea of confidence, right, before God.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.560]   Great, okay.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.200]   So, in line with that topic of confirmed,
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.360]   you notice that a lot of these verses,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.760]   or the verbs that are given,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.760]   are describing the condition of the believers, okay?
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.940]   And again, describing the state of these believers,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.560]   you notice that what he is doing
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.840]   is truly talking about their,
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.280]   we mentioned it already a little bit,
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   but they're confirmed in their what?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.120]   Yeah, they're confirmed in their faith.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.240]   Which I find, just again,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.640]   really, really interesting, don't you?
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.720]   In a book that's all about, like,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.140]   you guys are behaving like the world.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.040]   Like, someone, I wanna give credit,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   but I remember reading it, but not remembering who it's from,
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.120]   but that idea is if you're in a courtroom,
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.960]   does the prosecutor have enough evidence,
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.620]   visible evidence, to convict you of being a Christian?
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.220]   Perhaps the Corinthian church may not have had that.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.040]   Because their external actions looked just like the world.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.840]   But what's interesting is the way that this begins off
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.840]   is a lot of these verbs are all about confirming their faith.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.640]   So, I wanna go down through some of these descriptions,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.480]   and so I have it here,
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.920]   descriptions of the saints and the grace of God.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.020]   Essentially, as I say that,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.240]   descriptions of saints and the grace of God,
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.400]   all it's really saying is,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.040]   this is a description of a genuine believer,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.640]   given the faith, right?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.000]   Having been given the grace of God to be in the faith.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.320]   And this is what he says.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.840]   And I actually broke it down into three different things,
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.640]   because I felt like there was three different,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.680]   I guess, verb tenses in there.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.120]   About the past, the present, and the future.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.920]   So if you look, starting from verse five,
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   it says that in everything, you were enriched.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.960]   In him, in all speech, and all knowledge.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.660]   Even as the testimony concerning Christ
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.400]   was confirmed in you.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.720]   And so, in the past, he says,
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.440]   as one who has been graced by God,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.680]   you have been, one, enriched.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.760]   So the letter A underneath past is enriched.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.920]   They have been enriched in all speech,
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.860]   they have been enriched in all knowledge.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.160]   There's a sense in which,
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.920]   if you think about those two things,
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.520]   all speech and all knowledge,
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.720]   back then, it was considered so highly,
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.120]   incredibly valuable for you to have knowledge,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.100]   and for you to be able to articulate it.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.940]   Not only that, but even in the faith, spiritually speaking,
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.600]   for us as believers,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   isn't that surely the proclamation of the faith
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.320]   we proclaim to have,
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.040]   that which we hold onto so dearly as a Christian, right?
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.880]   So he says, in these two areas,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.240]   these two spheres,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.260]   in the way of speaking about life and God,
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.100]   you have been thoroughly enriched, okay?
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.720]   But what's more, he says,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.680]   the testimony is confirmed in you.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.600]   Testimony is confirmed in you, all right?
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.480]   In the next verse, verse seven,
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.680]   he says, so that you are,
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.320]   and that are, as a state of being, is present.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.960]   You are not lacking in any gift,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.320]   awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.160]   So currently, currently,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.320]   A, saints do not lack any gift.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.880]   Okay, saints do not lack any gift.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.440]   Secondly, saints eagerly await
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.500]   the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.000]   So he's basically describing the Christian,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   a person of faith, and he says,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   they're enriched, they have the testimony confirmed.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.360]   Testimony confirmed meaning is
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.040]   that repentance and faith in Christ
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.840]   has been confirmed in their lives.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.260]   But furthermore, right now, they lack nothing
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.560]   in terms of gifts.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.000]   Now, the Greek term for the word gifts is charizoma,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.340]   which really talks about grace gifts.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.160]   So here's the thing.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.040]   I find he's really summarizing
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.680]   the Christian life altogether.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:05.200]   We are a people who are, as believers,
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.340]   engaging in an act of faith and belief
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.300]   in the propositional truth,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.240]   to understand that we have everything
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.740]   for life and godliness in Christ now.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.580]   That we can be content whether we have little,
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.280]   whether we have a lot, we can be content
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.400]   whether we're healthy or we're sick,
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.580]   we can be content in every single circumstance
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.460]   because we lack no gift, no grace,
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.300]   because it's all found in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.640]   That describes the current state of a Christian.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.680]   What's more, we are a people
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.320]   where we've been promised so much,
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.800]   but that promise and realization of that,
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.640]   what God has promised us,
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.720]   is not experienced right now, so to speak,
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.680]   but we're waiting for the revelation of Christ.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.960]   Whether there's gonna be vindication for the saints,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.100]   whether there's gonna be a righteous reign of Christ,
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.120]   whether there's gonna be, in the presence,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.280]   worshiping in his harmonious community
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.820]   and all that kind of stuff,
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.780]   waiting for us when Christ is revealed.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.440]   So he's describing the Christian in the present case.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.740]   Future, number three.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.560]   I'm sorry, yeah, number three and verse eight.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.800]   Who will also confirm you to the end,
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.460]   blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.660]   Blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.320]   So, he talks about how
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.840]   saints will be confirmed in the end
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.820]   and saints will be blameless in the end.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.600]   So you can write those in as saints
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.720]   in the description of saints in the grace of God.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.420]   Saints will be confirmed in the end,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.200]   saints will be blameless.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:50.980]   As we observe these things of what Apostle Paul is saying,
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.360]   some of these things aren't like
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.960]   profound new information to us,
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.920]   but I want us to examine and observe
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.720]   what Apostle Paul is doing.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.380]   First and foremost, his perspective, again,
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:12.060]   is not so discouraged just because the people
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.400]   are not responding the way perhaps we wish.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.680]   That Apostle Paul all the more does not rest
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.740]   on the confidence of just man,
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.620]   but look at the beginning of the next verse.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:28.520]   God is faithful, right?
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.100]   God is faithful.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.600]   So you look at the perspective of Apostle Paul
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.720]   and as he's describing the Christian,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.000]   these descriptions, number one,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.560]   cause us to think about what we recall to,
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.860]   what we were expected of,
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.080]   but it also gives us this perspective
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.880]   that Apostle Paul has.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.200]   This view of the saint that he's giving
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.680]   and the description of the saints that he's giving,
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.820]   he can still maintain that standard,
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.280]   he can still maintain that expectation, why?
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.840]   Because his confidence is not in the people,
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.560]   but his confidence is in God.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.640]   So as we think about that, I ask you this next question.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.020]   We've hit it already a little bit.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.680]   I want you guys just to think about it a little bit more.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.440]   What is Apostle Paul's strategy?
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.400]   What's his purpose in this introduction?
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.280]   Can you guys perhaps summarize for me
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.640]   or tell me the main thrust of what he is doing, okay,
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.720]   by way of this introduction?
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.680]   What would you say?
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.840]   (silence)
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:35.720]   I mean, someone could read this, honestly.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.160]   Someone could read this like,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.680]   I do this sometimes, you know?
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.560]   There are times when you have to say hard things to people,
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.600]   but you always start off with,
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.240]   but you do this so well.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.560]   Like overall, if you're talking to a guy
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.520]   and you really don't think he should dress a certain way,
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.600]   like overall you have great fashion sense and stuff,
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.080]   but that Phoenix shirt just really needs to go, you know?
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.800]   Like you start off with something nice
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.040]   so that you can crush him afterwards, you know?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.800]   Is that what Apostle Paul is doing?
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.080]   Just being nice in the beginning so that I lift you up
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.960]   and then, wha-bam, I get you down.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.520]   No, that's not what he's doing.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.120]   Or just because he knows he has to say hard stuff,
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.560]   at least he's starting with trying to reaffirm them.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.320]   Why is he reaffirming their faith
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.040]   and saying you are called this way?
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.400]   This is what a Christian is.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.200]   This is what describes you.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.480]   What's his purpose and strategy in doing that?
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.520]   That's the question.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:46.160]   Oh, sorry, yes.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.240]   (laughs)
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.080]   Yes.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:46:09.680]   Right, okay.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.040]   Yeah, great.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:19.880]   Thank you.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.240]   So that is a truth, again, that perhaps it's not profound
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.360]   or profoundly new to many of us,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.520]   but I want us to think about that
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.760]   because that truly is the foundation of his exhortation.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   He's going to lay down the foundation,
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.920]   like a concrete base to say,
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.440]   this is who you are in Christ by calling,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.160]   and now you have to live up to it,
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.960]   and now you have to live accordingly, right?
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.680]   The imperative for you must, you should, and you ought to
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.040]   is all possible because you are
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.980]   by the Spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, right?
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.000]   This is how we are challenged in the scripture.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.960]   This is how we are to think when we think about
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.440]   our exhortations, our disciplines, our works,
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.200]   and our deeds as a believer in Christ.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.400]   That this is the calling to which God has already given.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.520]   This is the status to which God has already
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.600]   laid down for us, and what we are doing
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.800]   is designed to fulfill that calling God has given us.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.720]   That's going to be the thrust and imperative
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.440]   for the rest of the book.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.520]   If this is truly who we are,
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.520]   then this is truly who we must be.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.980]   Apostle Paul, I think, beautifully lays down
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.640]   the core of what's really important for them,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.720]   their identity in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.200]   their identity by his calling.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.520]   Okay, so, in your own time, you guys can write down
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.220]   perhaps a brief summary.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.880]   That's a really good way to come down
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.840]   to an interpretation, you know?
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.240]   A really good summary of what this
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.580]   introductory paragraph has for us.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.600]   Okay?
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.440]   All right.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:11.580]   Now, any questions so far on the things
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.500]   that we observed and the kind of conclusions
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.340]   that we made?
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.780]   What is Apostle Paul doing?
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.420]   What's the purpose of his letter?
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.240]   Okay?
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.840]   Then I hope that you guys have some good conversations
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.260]   in your discussions, and here are some of the questions
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:29.340]   I tried to think of, but you guys
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.220]   obviously can just share more.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.020]   The first is, what sort of application
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.540]   can we draw from Apostle Paul's strategy
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.660]   in laying the foundation for his entire letter?
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.760]   We just said that he is pointing at
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.140]   the identity in Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.700]   the Lord Jesus Christ, and he's pointing at
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.060]   their salvation, their identity as one's called,
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.860]   and saying, this is who you are,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.560]   and so this is the commands that are there, right?
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.520]   What kind of applications can we draw?
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.360]   You know?
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.140]   What kind of convictions can we have in our lives?
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.040]   Secondly, the centerpiece of the message,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.900]   at least the bulk of it, was a description
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.500]   of the saints, past, present, and future.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.720]   When you look at this description,
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.980]   what sort of personal convictions do you gain
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.340]   from evaluating yourself against
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.140]   the descriptions we observed?
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.340]   So we can ask ourselves, do I feel like
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.780]   I've been truly enriched both in knowledge
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.940]   and in the content of my faith?
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.580]   Has it been confirmed for me?
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.540]   Has my repentance been confirmed?
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.060]   Am I confident that I've repented before God,
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.040]   that this gospel is truly mine?
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.900]   It's not a faith that's on a doctrinal statement.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.300]   It's not something I signed off on.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.500]   It's something that I possess.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.800]   This faith, I possess it.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.220]   Do I truly feel like I lack no grace,
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.460]   that for life of godliness, there's a passage
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.840]   in 2 Peter 1 and 3, divine power has been granted to us,
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.940]   everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.420]   In Christ, I truly lack nothing.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.540]   It's this present, personal conviction.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.300]   Are you waiting for the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.500]   Do you have confidence he's gonna perfect you?
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.260]   There are so many people who are afraid of death.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.740]   There are so many people who are afraid of this and that.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.100]   And I think I shared with you guys,
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.420]   if you guys can pray for me, I've been having, still,
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.140]   nightmares of my children's death.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.660]   And it wakes me up at night.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.980]   And I've been battling it, I've been trying to battle it
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.380]   with truth and remembering.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.020]   And one of the things I just remind myself is,
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.740]   you can't die unless God's done with you.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.020]   And when he's done with you, you're dead,
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.420]   but if you're a believer, death is just death, right?
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:39.140]   Like, nobody dies, no sparrow falls unless God says so.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.820]   Right now, I'm having all these crazy dreams
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.180]   of my kids drowning in different scenarios and stuff,
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.420]   and I wake up like, (yells) you know?
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.140]   And I can't go back to sleep 'cause I'm too afraid,
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.460]   but I've been trying to fight that with,
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:55.220]   if you understand God's sovereignty,
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.700]   no person dies prematurely, not a single one.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.780]   And if you're a believer in Christ,
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.180]   you're just safe, right?
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.740]   He completes you, he perfects you,
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.100]   he leads you all the way to the end.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.580]   But are these confidences, faith convictions,
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.540]   past, present, future, for you currently?
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.940]   So again, please share that with your group
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.020]   on a more personal level.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.900]   Number three, how receptive are we to instruction?
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:26.100]   I ask that because, given the context of things,
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:29.140]   Apostle Paul, again, has to be like, I'm an apostle!
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.980]   I planted this church, you know?
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.200]   I almost hear it that way, and I wonder.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.100]   But truly, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.140]   how receptive are we to instruction?
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.060]   Do we only receive instruction from people
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.580]   who are older than us, more mature than us,
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.420]   more knowledgeable than us?
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.260]   Can we receive instruction from people
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.140]   who are younger than us,
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.580]   if that at least is true and accurate?
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:55.580]   Do we feel like, you know, what did I put here?
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.900]   Are you a bad patient who typically ignores
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   doctor's orders, you know?
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.420]   The scriptures tell you to do X, Y, and Z,
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.060]   and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.620]   But then it's always put back on the backburners.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.140]   Have you tuned out certain people who annoy you?
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.460]   They've already talked to you one time,
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.380]   they talk to you a second time,
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.580]   by the third time, you're just like, off, please, you know?
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.780]   How receptive are you to biblical truth,
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.180]   good, godly wisdom, how receptive are you?
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.220]   Now, obviously, this is kind of like a yes or no question,
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.460]   like, yeah, I am, or no, I'm not,
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.460]   but just share at least more personally, you know?
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.460]   As of lately, I've been having a great hunger
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.180]   for more instruction, I've been really hungry,
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.980]   or, you know what, actually, it's just been kind of,
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.540]   I'm not that interested sometimes.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:38.140]   Just be truthful with each other as much as possible, okay?
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.860]   Alrighty, then I just wanna cover really quick
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.100]   the homework assignment.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.700]   Now, it's a lot, but I'm gonna emphasize just two things,
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.780]   okay, the homework assignments are just,
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.340]   please review the inductive Bible study process
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.260]   attached to this thing.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.940]   Secondly, please read 1 Corinthians all the way through
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.700]   as many times as possible this week,
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.180]   and answer the following questions.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.680]   Number four, for the next time,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.940]   please simply make closer observations of verse 10 through 17.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.220]   If you're super duper busy these days,
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.300]   and you can only do a few of these,
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.220]   number one, I just recommend you to just read.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.940]   Exposure to the Bible is the best thing you can do.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.700]   The more you read and the more you remember,
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.940]   the better it is for you.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.740]   And especially reading big chunks sometimes
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.420]   is helpful to understand the whole,
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.900]   so read 1 Corinthians as many times as you can,
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.860]   at least once through, it'll be the first one.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:34.340]   And then the second would be, focus on verse 10 through 17,
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.460]   and try to ask, you know, the best questions you can,
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.900]   and observe the things that are there,
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.180]   observe the verbal commands, observe what's the problem,
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.820]   what's the possible method of instruction,
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.940]   dissect the thing, and then really just make
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.220]   all the observations that you can, okay?
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:54.500]   All right, any questions about today's study
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.740]   or what the homework is?
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.300]   Okay, let's pray, and then you guys can jump
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.620]   and have time in your small groups to discuss, all right.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:12.860]   Father God, we thank you for this scripture,
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:17.340]   and Lord, I pray that if anybody in this room is in sin
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.860]   or perhaps have faltered, acted selfishly,
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.620]   whatever it may be, I pray, Father God,
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.580]   that our greatest, most piercing conviction
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:32.700]   would be the pain of being far from you,
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:37.700]   would be the pain of really affecting negatively
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.300]   the relationship and the harmony that we have with you.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.980]   And I pray, Father God, that if anything
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.080]   really causes us to return, it would always be you.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.580]   And Lord, we thank you, God, that you are such a God,
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:53.820]   so patient, so kind, as to give instruction like this,
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.640]   to begin with reaffirming and reassessing
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.780]   the calling that you've given to your people.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.660]   Father God, I pray that through this study again,
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:06.460]   it would be so fruitful for our faith and our living.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.300]   God, that surely we would not be like the world,
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.060]   that we would not mimic the fallen world,
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.940]   we would not mimic and desire the many pleasures
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.820]   that this world has to offer.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.020]   But Father God, rather, as having once received
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.020]   the greatest pleasure of all,
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.260]   we would continue our lives by sinning no more,
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.160]   but rather, God, living our lives
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.620]   and offering to you of everything
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.100]   to please you and to honor you.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.580]   We thank you, God, in Christ's name, amen.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.980]   All right, thanks, everyone.
