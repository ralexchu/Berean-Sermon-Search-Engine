[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.580]   Welcome to Breen Community Church online service.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.540]   And also those of you who are joining us
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.060]   from outside the church, you know,
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.420]   we've been getting a lot of requests
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.620]   to get on our Facebook page from, I think, Michigan.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.180]   There's another Breen Community Church there.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.940]   So if you've logged on to our service by mistake, surprise,
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.480]   you probably weren't looking for an Asian face,
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.400]   but you're welcome to join us anyway.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.580]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.260]   First of all, next Sunday, oh, no, not next Sunday,
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.340]   April 26th at not 1 p.m., but 3 p.m.,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.460]   we're gonna be having a member Zoom Q&A session.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.260]   This is not a mandatory meeting.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.300]   This is just for those of you who have some questions.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.660]   And even if you don't, you wanna just sit in and listen,
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   you're welcome to do that.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.720]   So that's gonna be taking place April 26th at 1 p.m.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.280]   And also starting from this week, again,
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.980]   we're resuming our Ephesians Bible study.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.580]   Pastor Mark will be uploading the Bible study
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.140]   by 7 p.m. this Tuesday.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.220]   So for those of you who are home groups and small groups,
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.340]   you guys can adjust your meetings accordingly.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.180]   Obviously, today is a very special day,
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.020]   not only for our church, but all around the world.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.020]   People are gathering, obviously, online
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.820]   for the purpose of worshiping our Savior.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.380]   It is a day that has made an impact, not only on us,
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.400]   but all throughout history.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.340]   For the last 2,000 years, there is no greater event
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.340]   that has caused the change of every part of our life
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.860]   outside of the resurrection.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.380]   And so it is a very special day for that purpose,
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.740]   and we're gonna be taking some time to reflect
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.140]   on the significance and the meaning behind that.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.260]   But for our church, there's also other significance.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.300]   It is our church's 23rd anniversary
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.740]   of our church being inaugurated.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.540]   And so we're able to celebrate
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.700]   with a huge crowd here at church.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.180]   We don't have a cake, but again,
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.780]   happy birthday, Bruin Community Church.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.920]   But many of you do know, but some of you guys may not know,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.940]   that today is also my oldest son's 23rd birthday.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.620]   So when the church was being inaugurated,
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.660]   he was at the hospital being born,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.180]   so I wasn't able to come to the inauguration service.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.820]   So every year when we celebrate our church's birthday,
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.300]   his birthday coincides in the same birthday.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.100]   Along with that, we have some birthdays
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.980]   that we wanna celebrate today.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.560]   We have Karis and Matthias Chong, happy birthday.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.260]   We have Connor Kim, his birthday is also today.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:44.140]   And we have some children that were extra specially good,
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.460]   and we wanna reward you by giving you a shout out.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.880]   We have Shane Kim, your mother said
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.620]   you were extra special last week,
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.020]   and so we're gonna give a shout out to you.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.880]   Morgan Leung, hey Morgan.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.500]   And then Yoshi and Emmett, they were very good,
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.260]   and I'm sure they will continue to be good, or else.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.660]   I heard, your father said that you were very good last week,
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.740]   so we want you to keep up the good work.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.540]   Jaden Kim, your father Mitchell also said you were good,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.380]   and we're gonna take his word for it.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.280]   Jaden, good job.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.760]   And then we have Charlie and Christopher Tang.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.060]   Great job guys, and we want you to keep up the good work.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.240]   And I'm sure there's many other children
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.140]   who are doing a great job,
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.380]   but the parents forgot my phone number,
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.460]   and so maybe they'll text me next week
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.000]   about how great of a job you're doing
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.060]   sitting and worshiping with your parents.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.560]   I have a special gift for you,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.500]   that we will be waiting for you when you come to church.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.040]   So maybe it's not a big deal, but it's a big deal to me,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.840]   so I have some encouragement lollipops for you.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.660]   Like we do every Sunday,
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.860]   we wanna take some time to give our offering,
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.300]   but as we give our offering,
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.960]   today being our Easter Sunday, our Resurrection Sunday,
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.920]   we have a special presentation from our sisters.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.060]   As the offering is going,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.960]   as you are being deliberate about giving online,
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.520]   we wanna take some time to especially praise
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.440]   and honor God in this way.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.520]   So let me pray for us,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.760]   and then they'll be presenting and guiding us through that.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.600]   So let's pray.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.360]   Gracious and loving Father,
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.900]   we thank you so much, Father,
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   for what this day represents.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.240]   Not only what it represents, but the power behind it
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.560]   and how it radically changed our lives and our destiny.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.240]   I pray, Father God, that the significance of it
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.460]   would not just be another day of the year,
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.460]   but we remember this from a distance.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.800]   I pray, Father God, that the impact of this resurrection
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.160]   will be more and more powerful each day that we live.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.440]   I pray for our brothers and sisters around the world
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.580]   who are celebrating with us in various corners,
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.940]   especially those, Lord God,
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.520]   who are in places where they do not have internet,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.420]   where they are isolated in their own homes.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.980]   I pray that what we are not able to do,
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.940]   that your Holy Spirit would lead them and guide them,
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.860]   would continue to grow in their hearts for you.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.100]   We pray that you would unite our churches, Lord God,
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.500]   that we may glorify you,
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.460]   that we may exalt you
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.060]   and proclaim the good news of the gospel.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.900]   So I pray that what is a dark situation in this world,
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.940]   that you would cause great things, Lord God,
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.820]   to come out of this.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.400]   I pray that even in our giving,
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   may it be more than just our finances,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.100]   but our very hearts that we give to you this morning.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:49.340]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.100]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.940]   He is risen.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.260]   I wanna as well welcome those
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.220]   who have not joined our church before
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.500]   and welcome to our live stream.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.600]   Also, I wanted to just encourage you,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.300]   as I've been at home watching these live streams,
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.700]   there's a tendency to take a viewing kind of attitude,
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.580]   sometimes just hanging out on the couch watching.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.900]   But what I wanna encourage you,
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.220]   we wanna replicate what, if you were here, what I would say.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.620]   So what I want to encourage you and your families
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.300]   to stand with us, if you are able,
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.660]   so we can worship together in your homes,
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.700]   and then we can give God intentional worship
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.900]   as we look at our screens, as we worship together.

[00:32:49.380 --> 00:33:00.060]   - All right, good morning.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.720]   As we celebrate the Lord's resurrection,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.640]   I'm gonna spend some time in John chapter 11,
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.440]   and we're actually gonna work backwards
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.920]   because what happens in John chapter 11
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.000]   is really a setup for the resurrection
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.560]   that will take place.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.040]   And so I'm not gonna read a text,
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.760]   but I'm gonna pray for us,
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.280]   and then we'll jump right into the sermon this morning.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.120]   So let's pray.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.280]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.800]   Help us to understand the significance of this day
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.180]   and be impacted by it,
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.160]   that our confession as you being our Lord and Savior
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.400]   will be more than mere words.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.800]   I pray for radical changes in our hearts, Lord God,
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.200]   that we may reevaluate every part of who we are,
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.120]   what we think, what we do,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.160]   our goals, our hopes, our dreams, Lord God,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.260]   may all be satisfied in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.800]   May your word be highlighted,
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.280]   may your very breath, Lord God,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   be experienced by the people who hear it.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.920]   If you did a survey online to see
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.160]   what's the greatest fear of mankind,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.760]   you'll probably get many different lists.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.160]   On some lists, they say that the greatest fear
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.620]   that most people will say is public speaking,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.360]   which is kind of weird,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:34.280]   but people fear judgment when they speak in public.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.880]   Some people fear, their greatest fear is rejection,
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.800]   fear of heights, fear of failing.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.520]   Now, fear of death is always in the top 10,
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.680]   but for whatever the reason, it was never number one.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.000]   And I think the reason why it's not number one
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.480]   in most people's list is because for most people
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.600]   on a day-to-day basis, death is not real
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.120]   until we actually pass away or we experience the death
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.780]   in some way, in an intimate way.
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.840]   But I think most of us will agree
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.200]   that death is the greatest fear of all mankind.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.400]   I mean, the part of the reason why we're having service
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.940]   online is because of this fear of death.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.360]   The world did not get shut down
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.780]   because of fear of public speaking.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.080]   The world didn't shut down because of fear of rejection.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.040]   The world shut down because of this pandemic,
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.240]   and it's not just a pandemic.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.440]   If there was a cure to this pandemic,
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.260]   people, we didn't shut down, the world did not shut down
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.300]   because of fear of getting ill.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.200]   The world shut down is that because there's a possibility
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.160]   that this illness can lead to death.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.520]   But according to statistics, at least in the United States,
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.920]   the fatality rate is somewhere between one to 1.2%.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.840]   At least that's what it is now.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.320]   And they've had enough samples to say
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.760]   that that's probably accurate.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.480]   It may even go down further as they do more testing,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.880]   but that's 1% fatality of people
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.440]   who actually get the disease.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.320]   So if you take that totality of everybody
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.360]   who's in the United States, it's not high.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   But it's enough that this fear of death is strong enough
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   that whatever will come out of this pandemic
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.320]   and this shutdown, it was worth shutting down to save lives.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:31.000]   Now, this Resurrection Sunday is all about death.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   It's about the hope that Christ brings.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.520]   The greatest fear of mankind
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.160]   turns into the greatest hope of mankind,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.000]   because of what Christ has done today.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.480]   In Hebrews 2, 14 to 15, it says,
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.680]   "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.440]   "he," meaning Christ, "himself likewise
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.080]   "also partook of the same, that through death
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.640]   "he might render powerless him who had the power of death,"
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.120]   that is the devil, "and might free those
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.480]   "who through fear of death were subject to slavery
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.520]   "all their lives."
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.960]   And I think this verse is relevant in any generation,
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.160]   at any time, even when we're living in peace,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.800]   but especially now, as the whole world
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.120]   is in lockdown temporarily,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.280]   to try our best to avoid this death.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.600]   This Resurrection Sunday is really about that,
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   about turning this dark pandemic,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.120]   this possibility of death, ultimately, to glory.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.240]   Well, I'm gonna be working backwards today,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.600]   'cause we looked at his crucifixion, his trial on Friday.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.880]   We talked about Palm Sunday,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.640]   but we're actually gonna walk backwards
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.960]   into John chapter 11, where Jesus foreshadows
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.520]   what he was going to do in John chapter 11.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.320]   And it is one of his I am statements,
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.080]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.040]   So as we work through chapter 11,
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   I want you to pay attention to the various responses
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.920]   that people are giving to this resurrection
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.560]   or this bringing back to life, Lazarus.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.640]   And so what I wanna do is, starting from chapter one,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.200]   there are five specific scenes.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.000]   So if you were making a movie or doing a play,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.280]   there's five specific scenes that highlight
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.480]   certain events that are taking place.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.520]   And through it all, what I'd like you to pay attention to
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.560]   is the different responses that people are giving
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.640]   to Jesus's resurrection.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.360]   So scene one, so if you have the children's outline,
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.640]   that outline is basically the sermon outline.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.480]   So if you parents wanna follow that as well,
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.880]   if that's gonna help you.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.680]   Scene one, starting from verse one through six.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.800]   So what I encourage you to do is,
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.360]   the verses will be displayed on the screen,
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.040]   at least parts of it.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.720]   But if you have your Bible, open it up
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.120]   and I encourage you to just keep it there
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   because we're gonna be working through
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.080]   the whole text, chapter 11 today.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   Scene one, verse one through six,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.520]   the sickness that leads to glory.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.640]   And this is the setup behind what is going to take place.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.040]   Verse 11, I'm not gonna read everything,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.160]   but I want you to pay attention.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   Now, a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany,
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.600]   the village of Mary and the sister Martha.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.120]   It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.960]   and wiped his feet with her hair,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.280]   whose brother Lazarus was sick.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.160]   So first thing I want us to remember or to highlight
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.880]   is that Lazarus was not just any man.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   Lazarus was a man who was the younger brother,
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.720]   most likely of Mary and Martha.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.640]   Mary Martha, as you know, is a very prominent figure
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.720]   in Jesus's ministry.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.440]   Their name is mentioned many times
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.440]   throughout the scriptures.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.080]   And it highlights Mary was the one who anointed Jesus.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.760]   When everybody else was paying attention to other things,
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.200]   either Mary knew what was gonna happen
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.680]   or Mary's love for Christ was so overwhelming
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.160]   that she was willing to break a year's worth
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.720]   of an average pay to prepare Jesus for his burial.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.120]   She's the one who got on her knees
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.280]   and humbled herself and washed Jesus's feet.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.280]   And it's highlighted that this relationship
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.400]   that Jesus has with this family was special.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.160]   It was not just any family.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.080]   And he goes on to say, "So the sister sent word to him,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   "saying, 'Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.'"
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.280]   Now, Jesus healed complete strangers in crowds.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.160]   Sometimes he was very gracious to people
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.360]   who were even hostile to him.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.600]   Remember the lepers who he healed
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.440]   and nine of them just celebrated
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.040]   and just took off, forgot about him, and only one returned?
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.520]   So it's highlighting if God was gracious
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.680]   to just strangers or multitudes,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.760]   how much more would he be to whom he loved?
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.640]   And all of this is a setup for what's about to happen.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.760]   Verse four, "When Jesus heard this, he said,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.420]   "'This sickness is not to end in death,
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.540]   "'but the glory of God, so that the Son of Man
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.440]   "'may be glorified by it.'"
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.080]   And again, all of this is a setup
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.480]   for what he's about to do in chapter 11.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.440]   To raise Lazarus at the end of this chapter,
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.400]   he said, "All of this is God-ordained.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.380]   "This darkness is going to turn to glory.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.720]   "You guys are worried and you call the right person.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.620]   "I am gonna go, but it's not gonna end in sadness.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.840]   "It's gonna end in glory."
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.280]   So you would expect that Lazarus, whom he loved,
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.560]   whose sister Mary was the one who anointed his feet,
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.240]   Martha is constantly busy serving the disciples.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.800]   And he says, "Don't worry, he's not gonna die.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.880]   "It's gonna end in his glory."
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.120]   That he would pack up his bag, whatever he was doing,
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.680]   he would pack up his bag and get his disciples to go.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.820]   But instead, in verse six, it says,
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.480]   "So when he heard that he was sick,
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.580]   "he stayed then two days longer in the place where he was."
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.600]   Which is a very strange way to end that.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.140]   Because every part of what he says in this scene,
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.080]   you would expect him to pack up and hurry
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.080]   and get out of there to make sure
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.360]   that he gets there in time.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.580]   Instead, he takes his sweet time.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.420]   He takes two days longer.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.760]   Now, why did he do that?
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.340]   Because part of the display of God's glory
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:19.040]   is going to be him allowing them to experience the death.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.320]   He wasn't going to preserve him from this death.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.520]   He was going to allow them to experience the death
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.740]   and the grief that comes along with this death,
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.180]   with the weeping and sadness that comes along with that.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.900]   And he stayed two days longer
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.740]   to allow them to experience this,
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.220]   and he wanted to make sure
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.140]   that there was going to be darkness
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.800]   before he turns on the light.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.840]   Now, this is foreshadowing of what was going to happen
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.540]   to Israel and to mankind itself.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.500]   When Jesus was crucified, he didn't just die in obscurity.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.700]   He was crucified by the hands
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.180]   of the leaders of Israel.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.240]   He was crucified by the hands of the people
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.040]   that he came and he wept for.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.220]   And so the reason why God allowed that
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.300]   is he allowed the room to get as dark as possible
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.920]   before he turns on the light.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   If you have something to display,
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.280]   you want to make sure that display is seen clearly.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.960]   And in order to do that, you have to turn down the light.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.680]   Jesus was allowing mankind to experience
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.600]   their lowest moment of history.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.280]   The darkest moment of mankind's history
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.900]   was the death of Jesus Christ,
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.600]   because he was the one who was preparing,
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.680]   he was the one who loved us,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.720]   he was the one who took our sorrows
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.000]   and bore it on himself,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.240]   and it was he, the author of life, that we crucify.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.320]   The darkest moment of mankind's history
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.600]   is not the Holocaust.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.200]   Slavery, as ugly as it is, and it was,
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.600]   was not the darkest part of human history.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.840]   It was a day that mankind chose to crucify,
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.140]   the only one that could save us from our sins.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.640]   Jesus allows this to take place.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.400]   And so finally, after two days, we get to scene two.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.980]   And scene two, you know, if this wasn't a sermon,
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.360]   there's so much comical material in this section.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.480]   The cluelessness of the disciples, verses seven through 16.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.320]   Then after he said to the disciples,
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.180]   "Let us go to Judea again,"
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.720]   the disciples said to him, "Rabbi,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.240]   the Jews were just now seeking to stone you,
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.800]   and are you going there again?"
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.840]   In other words, you know what's gonna happen
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.680]   when you go there.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.000]   All of our enemies who want to kill you,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.480]   all the leaders of Israel, their power,
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.960]   the soldiers, the temple soldiers,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.700]   they're all in that area.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.080]   Which, you know, the reason why this is so comical
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.920]   is because Jesus has been steadily moving down
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.960]   from Galilee to Jerusalem.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.840]   He made it very clear that his final destination
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.540]   was never going to be Bethany.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.760]   Bethany was just a place that he's passing through.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.640]   He said, "Not only is he gonna go to Bethany,
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.960]   he's gonna go to the heart.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.320]   He's going to the heart of danger, into Jerusalem."
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.800]   And he's been telling them this.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.240]   They've been on this journey for months.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.320]   When finally, Jesus says,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.920]   with Bethany about two miles away from Jerusalem,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.280]   it's almost like they weren't there.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.040]   It's almost like Jesus said all of these things
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   and they didn't hear him at all.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   And Jesus said, "Are there not 12 hours in the day?"
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.640]   What does he mean by that?
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.800]   Well, if you read on, it says,
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.920]   "If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.880]   because he sees the light of this world.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.440]   But if anyone walks in the night,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.780]   he stumbles because the light is not in him."
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.760]   Now, what Jesus meant by that was,
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.060]   again, the Jews typically counted a day
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.600]   in 12-hour increments.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.200]   So you had the day and then you had the 12-hour nights.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.120]   Unlike when we say a day, we say 24 hours.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.800]   What Jesus meant was, if you walk in the light,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.320]   if you are living righteously,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.400]   and as long as you are with me,
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.600]   in other words, Jesus is saying you are safe.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.600]   Now, Jesus was not saying
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.080]   that you're not gonna experience pain
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.920]   'cause Jesus told him, "If you're gonna come after me,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   you have to pick up your cross."
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.360]   He already told them that he was going to be crucified.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.400]   He was going to be beaten.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.280]   So what he means by that is that you will not stumble,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.280]   means that safety means that you're gonna be in God's hand.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.640]   You're gonna be in God's purpose.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.500]   In other words, do not be afraid.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.580]   You're with the light.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.560]   This he said in verse 11,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.660]   after that, he said to them,
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.960]   "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.120]   but I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep."
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.180]   The disciples then said to him,
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:44.560]   "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.880]   Again, they don't get it.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.720]   These guys are deads, right?
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.880]   Of course, that's not what he meant,
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.720]   and he says, "Now Jesus had spoken of his death,
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.280]   but they thought that he was speaking of literal sleep."
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.120]   So when Jesus said he has fallen asleep,
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.240]   was that, "Well, he's just gonna wake up then.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.880]   Why do we need to go to Bethany?"
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.200]   You could just see the frustration in verse 14
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.000]   when Jesus says,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.660]   "So Jesus then said to them plainly,
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.200]   'Lazarus is dead.'"
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.240]   I don't know about you, but I don't know why.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.960]   That seems very comical to me.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.360]   He's fallen asleep, he's sleeping.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.720]   Why do we need to go to Bethany?
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.160]   He's dead, I meant he's dead.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.760]   He's dead.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.000]   And he had to speak to them very plainly
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.500]   because Jesus is saying one thing
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.800]   and they're constantly hearing something else.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.080]   Why was that?
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.060]   Why were they having such a hard time
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.320]   understanding what we read so plainly?
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:49.560]   In fact, if you read the Gospel of Mark,
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.380]   Mark makes it a point.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.180]   Mark makes it a point that Jesus made this very clear
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.700]   what he was doing.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.420]   Mark 8, 31 to 32,
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.980]   "And Jesus, he began to teach them that the Son of Man,"
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.480]   Son of Man meaning Jesus,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.300]   "must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.160]   "and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.900]   "And after three days, rise again."
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.620]   And he was stating the matter plainly.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.460]   Now, Mark says that on purpose.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.140]   It wasn't miscommunication.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.860]   Maybe Jesus didn't use the right words
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.140]   or maybe there was a different context
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.020]   that we don't understand.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.960]   He said, no, Jesus made this very plainly.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.060]   And Peter seems to have understood,
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.500]   at least for the moment.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.800]   And it says, "And Peter took him aside
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.620]   "and began to rebuke him."
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.580]   Now, think about the arrogance of that.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:45.460]   On one sense, humanly speaking,
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.100]   Peter loved Jesus and there's no question about that.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:53.260]   But it was also filled with his own arrogance and pride.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.220]   And you see that as they get closer to the cross,
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.580]   Peter's like, I'm gonna protect you.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.220]   All of these guys,
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.500]   all of these guys may fail you, but not me.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.380]   Obviously, Peter actually fails miserably.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.740]   He's the one who denies Jesus to his face three times.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.400]   But what Jesus said just didn't make sense.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.700]   He's the Messiah.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.780]   I mean, he walks on water.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.080]   He calms a storm that would have easily wiped out
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.600]   generational fishermen.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.500]   Why would you be killed?
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.940]   Who's going to kill you?
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.380]   Who's gonna beat you?
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.940]   He couldn't understand.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.180]   But if this is gonna happen, don't worry, you got me.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.000]   You got me.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.180]   Clearly, he didn't understand.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.060]   And Mark makes it a point to point that out.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.000]   Mark 9, 31 through 34.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.340]   Again, he says, "For he was teaching his disciples
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.560]   "and telling them, the Son of Man is to be delivered
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.980]   "into the hands of men and they will kill him.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.980]   "And when he has been killed,
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.760]   "he will rise three days later."
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.400]   Just in case you missed it the first time,
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.840]   let me say it again.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.880]   I will be killed, I will be killed.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.600]   But they did not understand this statement
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.020]   and they were afraid to ask.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.760]   Next time you read the Gospels,
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.960]   highlight that statement, they were afraid to ask.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.860]   'Cause this happens repeatedly in Jesus's ministry.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:25.080]   They just didn't get it because their paradigm
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.360]   of their worldview of the Messiah
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.440]   just didn't fit what Jesus was saying.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.200]   It fit what Jesus was doing
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.920]   because it said Messiah's going to come,
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.160]   he's going to give bread, he's going to bring in an era
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.400]   where broken people are gonna be healed,
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.700]   the lame are going to walk, the blind are going to see.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:47.460]   So he fulfills every part of the identification
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.200]   of the Messiah, but what he was saying
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.560]   didn't make any sense.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.120]   So they were hearing him say, "Oh, dying.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.840]   "Maybe he means sleeping now."
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.640]   Because sleeping means living, maybe living means dying.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.200]   I don't know what he means, but they didn't understand.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.880]   Verse 33, "They came to Capernaum
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.680]   "and when he was in the house, he began to question them,
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.520]   "what were you discussing on the way?
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.440]   "But they kept silent, for on the way,
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.860]   "they had discussed with one another
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.740]   "which of them was the greatest."
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.880]   Can you imagine that?
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:22.480]   I mean, we can understand the frustration
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.320]   that Jesus may have been in.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.960]   He's preparing them for his death and burial
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.400]   and on the side, they're having a conversation
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.920]   about who's gonna be the greatest.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.400]   So it's the written word,
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.440]   so we don't have a lot of exclamation marks,
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.520]   but I'm guessing in this scene too,
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.720]   there's a bit of yelling.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.480]   That's my guess, right?
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.440]   There's a lot of knocking on the head, you knuckleheads.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.040]   I just told you I'm gonna die.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.720]   And the discussion that you're having,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.800]   the thing that you're concerned about,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.580]   who's the greatest, who do you think?
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.800]   I'm gonna die in three days.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.840]   Yeah, okay, who's the greatest, who's the greatest?
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.440]   Mark makes it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.400]   It wasn't a misunderstanding.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.120]   It wasn't because Jesus didn't make it clear.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.720]   It just didn't fit their paradigm of what they wanted.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.360]   So they heard him and they filed it away
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.960]   because after his resurrection,
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.560]   they recollect all of this stuff.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.940]   He did say this, he did say he was gonna get beaten.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.280]   He did say he was gonna resurrect on the third day,
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.080]   but all of that didn't click until it actually happened
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.600]   and then he was resurrected.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.040]   So they did hear him, they just didn't understand him
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.600]   because it didn't fit.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.180]   Finally, in Mark 10, 33 to 37, saying,
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.660]   "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.040]   "and the Son of Man will be delivered
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.920]   "to the chief priests and the scribes,
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.680]   "and they will condemn him to death
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.240]   "and will hand him over to the Gentiles.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.900]   "They will mock him and spit on him
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.440]   "and scourge him and kill him,
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.740]   "and three days later, he will rise again."
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.780]   They didn't hear him the two previous time,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.780]   the third time, he describes in detail
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.240]   that he's gonna be mocked, spit on, scourged, and then killed.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.780]   But look what it says in verse 35.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:12.440]   James and John, the two sons of Zebedee,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.820]   came up to Jesus saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.560]   "whatever we ask of you."
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.500]   And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.920]   They said to him, "Grant that we may sit one on your right
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.140]   "and one on your left in your glory."
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:33.080]   I mean, talk about like, can you imagine?
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.340]   Jesus just said he's gonna be spit on, scourged,
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.900]   mocked, and then killed.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.020]   And then said, "Okay, yeah, but who's gonna sit
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.340]   "on your left and right?"
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:50.100]   Man, Jesus was one patient man.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.220]   He was patient.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.980]   Like, what human being would tolerate this?
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.460]   And not only did they not understand,
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.420]   Jesus already knew that at the time of his suffering
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.020]   that they were going to scatter.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.180]   And no matter how determined Peter was,
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.460]   no matter how determined Thomas was and the disciples were,
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.780]   when push came to shove,
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.620]   they weren't going to stand with him.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.080]   And yet, Jesus kept on going to the cross.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.540]   The disciples were dense.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.760]   They just did not understand.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.580]   And the reason why they did not understand
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.460]   is because Jesus and what he was saying
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.140]   did not fit their pursuit.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.380]   Their ambition blinded them to the truth.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.260]   Now, we could read this and say,
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.620]   wow, they're so dense, they're so dumb.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:43.320]   But I hope as we read this,
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.260]   that you and I could easily see ourselves
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.360]   in that same position.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.700]   Because there are very plain things
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.780]   that are taught in scripture
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.900]   that majority of the confessing Christians,
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.660]   almost like they've never heard it.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:03.060]   If you seek your life, he says, you will lose it.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.220]   But he who loses life for my sake, he will find it.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.540]   Plain.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.300]   And he repeats that over and over.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.340]   If you want to follow after me,
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.180]   pick up the cross and follow after me.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.020]   Plain.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:18.620]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.400]   and all these other things shall be added unto you.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.620]   We memorize these scripture,
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.580]   we teach this to our children,
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.040]   but how much of this is actually being applied?
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:30.620]   If somebody was to read this 2,000 years later
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.940]   of what our life looks like and what the Bible teaches,
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.460]   and then they studied the disciples,
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.500]   I don't know if there's gonna be a huge gap
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.840]   between them and us.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.780]   What this teaches us is that
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.500]   they had front row seats to Christ.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.380]   They saw him live.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.180]   They saw all of his powerful miracles,
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.460]   and yet because of their ambition,
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:55.140]   even though they believed him,
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.480]   even though they trusted him,
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.160]   because of their personal ambitions,
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.560]   he was going through one year and out the other.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.060]   Years ago, Steve Camp had a song called
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.020]   Playing Marbles with Diamonds.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.540]   I'm not gonna read the whole thing,
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.140]   and I think there's a few of you
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.420]   that may remember this song,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.860]   and this song goes like this.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.900]   Ah, there's a whole lot more than preaching to the choir,
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.520]   kneeling at the altar, or paying our tithe.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.860]   We've been treating God like he's happiness for hire.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   We've been playing marbles with diamonds.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.700]   Isn't it a shame how his name gets thrown around?
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.040]   We pat God on the back like a buddy from out of town.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.060]   We thank the man upstairs for the things
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.700]   people praise us for.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.300]   Oh, we give God the glory,
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.180]   but we're happy to take the award.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.020]   Ah, there's a whole lot more than raising lots of money,
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:46.420]   building our churches, and spreading our fame.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.820]   Faith is just the dice that you roll to get lucky.
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.460]   We've been playing marbles with diamonds.
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.580]   As Jesus is heading to the cross,
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.300]   and we celebrate his death and resurrection,
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.560]   do we recognize ourselves?
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:06.480]   Do we ourselves recognize what this day means for us?
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:13.140]   Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected for our sins.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.400]   And we may also have a new life in him.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:22.160]   But to their credit, even though they didn't understand,
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.080]   even though their own ambitions blinded them,
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:25.980]   they believed him.
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:28.140]   And they continue to follow him.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.900]   Even if they failed, Thomas says at the end of that scene,
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.060]   "Well, let us go then."
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.340]   I don't fully get what he is saying,
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.660]   but let us go with him.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.820]   And if he's going to die, let us die with him.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:39.660]   And so they go.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.260]   Many of us are probably in that same situation.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.540]   We don't fully understand what God is doing,
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.020]   why I'm in the situation that we're in.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.460]   And I don't know what God has planned at the end of this,
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:53.900]   but I'm gonna keep following.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.180]   Scene three.
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:01.140]   Jesus finally shows up in 17 to 27.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.700]   So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.320]   in the tomb for four days.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.500]   So he stays two days.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.020]   It takes him a couple days to get there.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.020]   And by the time he shows up,
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.620]   he's already been buried for four days.
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.040]   Now, Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.500]   and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.020]   to console them concerning their brother,
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.620]   which already tells us that this was a very public miracle.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.420]   This didn't just involve a few people.
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.780]   Many people were already there.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.220]   And this was because they were a very prominent family.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.060]   The fact that he was buried in a cave already tells us
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.660]   that he came from a rich family.
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.860]   An average family would not have been able to afford
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.660]   that kind of a burial.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.380]   So he was a very well-known, well-respected family.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.980]   Many Jews are there to mourn with them.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.780]   In verse 20, "Martha, therefore, when she heard
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.420]   "that Jesus was coming, went to meet him,
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.220]   "but Mary stayed at home.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.020]   "Martha then said to Jesus, 'Lord, if you had been here,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.900]   "'my brother would not have died.'"
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:04.260]   In that statement, you can tell that there is disappointment.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.660]   I thought you cared.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.380]   We already told you that he was ill.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.320]   Why did it take you so long to get here?
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.700]   If you had been here, he would not have died.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:24.580]   You see, for mankind, as long as we live,
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.240]   as long as we live, there's always hope.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.860]   Because you can start over with the business,
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   you can get another job, relationship goes sour,
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.140]   maybe have another relationship, there's always hope.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.580]   But the reason why the whole world is shut down right now
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.580]   is because if you die, that's it.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.100]   And even if we lose money, even if the economy tanks,
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.740]   even if all the businesses shut down,
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:51.620]   because our greatest fear and our final judgment
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:55.420]   is the death, we're gonna do,
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.860]   even if we sacrifice everything, we have to live.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:03.240]   God allows Martha to experience this grief.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:07.780]   And when he says to Jesus, "If you had been here,
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.300]   "my brother would not have died."
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:16.940]   You know, but Martha, remember, she's the one
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.880]   who's always running around busy,
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.060]   and she was complaining about Mary.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.880]   Remember, Jesus said, "Martha, Martha,
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.340]   "you were worried about so many things."
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.120]   Mary has chosen what is best.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.180]   Mary was just sitting there, eating up Jesus' words.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:34.040]   So maybe Martha paid attention,
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.660]   because in the very next verse, after she says that,
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:42.540]   in an accusatory tone to Jesus, she has some hope.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.540]   But even now, I know that whatever you ask God,
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.140]   God will give you.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:52.180]   Doesn't that sound a lot like us?
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.620]   We believe.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.860]   We believe.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.900]   Well, God, what are you doing?
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.140]   I worship you.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.000]   I tithe, I give, I serve.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.600]   But what are you doing?
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.720]   So you could see the conflict in Martha.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.080]   Why didn't you come?
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.760]   And even though she has very small faith, but even now.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.720]   See, Lazarus was not the first person
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   that he was going to raise.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.940]   If you read the Gospels, in Luke chapter seven,
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.380]   he raises a widow's son, Nain.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.220]   In Matthew chapter nine, he raises Jairus' daughter.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.620]   So they might not have been there,
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.600]   but they probably heard about this.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.620]   And even though they're experiencing grief,
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:42.820]   there is glimmer of hope.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.780]   Even now, I know that whatever you do,
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.220]   like even now, that God will give you.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.900]   Now, she doesn't know what he's going to do,
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.800]   but as long as you're here, I have some hope.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:58.200]   We are all in the same place.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.960]   And what the theologians call here and not yet.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.840]   We've all tasted the goodness of God as Christians.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.720]   We confessed him as Lord and Savior.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.520]   But from now until he comes,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.940]   we're going to be wrestling with that, living in two worlds.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.440]   Where our hope goes up and down based upon what we see,
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.280]   based upon our bank account,
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.560]   whether the stimulus check gets put into our bank account,
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.560]   and that day, it's probably going to feel good for a day.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.520]   And then the memory of that fades,
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.460]   and then our hope fades with it.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.500]   And we live, 'cause we live in two worlds.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.940]   And we see Martha, she's disappointed with Christ,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.500]   and yet she's maintaining her faith.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.280]   That's why in 2 Corinthians 4, 7, it says,
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.740]   "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.940]   "so that the surpassing greatness of the power
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.060]   "will be of God, not from ourselves."
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.280]   That our hope may not look like anything
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.060]   because it's contained in an earthen vessel, jars of clay.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.200]   But what it contains is powerful.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.120]   Jesus, in response to that, says in John 11, 25,
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.100]   Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:15.200]   "He who believes in me will live even if he dies."
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.680]   And obviously, he's pointing to Lazarus.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   I know he's dead, but even in death, he will live.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.520]   See, for human beings, there is no hope after death.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.880]   At least during this lifetime, you can start over.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.120]   You can repeat or you can do something else.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.880]   You can change your mind, you can move.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.120]   But if you die, it's final.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.560]   But Jesus says, at the core of mankind's darkness,
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   it's that even in that, even if he dies, he shall live.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.240]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.000]   He says, "Do you believe this?"
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.100]   Jesus didn't say, "Trust me, I'm gonna make him live."
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.640]   Jesus didn't say, "If you continue to come after me,
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.920]   "I will show you the way of life."
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.760]   He says, "I am the resurrection and the life, I am."
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.660]   Meaning, Christ himself is life.
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.160]   We talked about that last week.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.360]   Jesus is not simply the way to life.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.080]   He says, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.800]   That's why the greatest evidence of a man or a woman
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.300]   or a child who's been born again is his union with Christ.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:35.220]   Does he have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.200]   The question is not, do you go to church,
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.280]   do you read your Bible, do you do great things,
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.360]   are you generous, are you involved in helping the poor?
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.980]   That's not a question, that's not the distinguishing mark
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.320]   of a Christian and non-Christian,
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.280]   because Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.760]   Is there a personal affection relationship
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   with the man and God, Jesus Christ?
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.720]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.880]   That's why in 1 John 5, verse 12, it says,
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.460]   "He who has the Son has the life."
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:08.000]   If you have the Son, you have the life.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.700]   He who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.820]   The life he is talking about is not simply not dying.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:20.680]   The Bible uses two different words, bios and zoe.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.800]   Bios is the biological life, zoe means to be alive.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.480]   He's not simply saying that God is going to preserve us
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.820]   from physically dying.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:34.400]   He's going to give us life.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.000]   What God intended from the beginning,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.900]   this union with the author of life
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.400]   that was broken because of our sins.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.000]   He says, "If you come to me," he says, "I am the life."
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.640]   You know how you can recognize somebody who is near Christ?
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.680]   Almost always.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.920]   There's joy.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.640]   It doesn't matter if they're sitting in prison.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.680]   It doesn't matter if they have a disease.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.200]   It doesn't matter if they're in their deathbed.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.480]   It doesn't matter if they have a large bank account
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.920]   or many friends.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.620]   You can always tell when somebody is near Christ,
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.160]   there's always joy.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.400]   Because Jesus is life.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.500]   Jesus is the resurrection.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.580]   And that's why Jesus turns to Martha.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.760]   He doesn't just say, "I am the resurrection and the life,"
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.640]   because the point of why he came,
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.280]   he could have said that up in heaven.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.720]   But the whole reason why he came was the next question.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.580]   Do you believe this?
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.240]   Do you believe this?
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.540]   He wasn't simply declaring to the world, "I am life."
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:49.120]   He wasn't simply trying to display his glory.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.280]   His whole point was from that, "Do you believe this?"
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.240]   Because the Bible says, "If you confess with your mouth
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.460]   "that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.380]   "that Christ was raised from the dead,
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.080]   "that you will be saved."
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.320]   The whole point of the Resurrection Sunday
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.600]   is that question, "Do you believe that?"
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   Is the penalty of sin still dominating your life?
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.840]   Is the fear of death, has it gripped our lives
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.520]   and we're doing everything possible to avoid it
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.700]   because we don't know?
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.800]   Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.140]   Scene four, Jesus meets Mary.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:32.920]   This section, I wanna start from verse 32.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.540]   "Therefore, then Mary came where Jesus was.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.500]   "She saw him and fell at his feet, saying to him,
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.740]   "Lord, if you had been here,
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.980]   "my brother would not have died.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.580]   "And again, her disappointment."
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.680]   I mean, think about Mary, just a few days earlier,
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.440]   not that long ago, she humiliated herself.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.940]   Now again, that would be humiliating for anybody,
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.000]   but this was a prominent family,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.380]   very wealthy family, a dignified family.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.860]   So for Mary to be on her knees,
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.140]   wiping Jesus' feet with oil,
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.240]   is a position of even a humble servant
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.700]   would have been humble to do.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.700]   Mary, we don't know the depth of her faith,
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.660]   but she loved Jesus so much that she was willing to do that.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:29.380]   So you can see the disappointment in Mary's tone
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:33.700]   when she asked Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here,
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.060]   "my brother would not have died."
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.860]   You know, I think in the English, in the written word,
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.540]   it comes off the same, but I have a feeling
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.660]   that Martha's tone and Mary's tone was very different.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.080]   You know, 'cause Martha is the outgoing one,
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.300]   she's the one who's outspoken,
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.660]   and she was the one who was telling Jesus, "Rebuke Mary!"
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.460]   And Mary just sitting there quietly, just studying.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.000]   I have a feeling they said the exact same thing,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.860]   but Martha probably said, "Lord!"
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:59.160]   She probably ran up to him
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.420]   and called his name from a distance.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.460]   "If you had been here, my brother would not have died."
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.280]   Mary, for whatever reason, I see her as an introvert.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.760]   'Cause you don't hear a lot from her,
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.300]   she's just a woman of action.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.360]   "If you had been here, my brother would not have died."
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:22.280]   And there's a deep-seated disappointment
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.260]   in Christ in those words.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.520]   "Why did you allow this to happen?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.500]   "You know how much you mean to us.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.280]   "And I know how much Lazarus meant to you,
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.340]   "and I know how much you loved our family,
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.160]   "but why did you let this happen?"
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.520]   Verse 33, "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping,
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.400]   "and the Jews who came with her also weeping,
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.940]   "he was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled."
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:55.920]   And said, "Where have you laid him?"
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.120]   They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:05.160]   This is the shortest verse in all of the English Bible.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.560]   It says, "Jesus wept."
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.840]   Now, you have to understand
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.240]   that when the original Bible was written,
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.880]   there were no verses, there were no chapters.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.820]   It didn't happen until about 1300 AD.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.040]   The chapters came in,
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.360]   and then it was another 300 years after that
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.240]   where the verses came in.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.820]   So whoever put the verses in
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:29.940]   wanted to highlight Jesus wept.
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.440]   'Cause he made it one verse.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.200]   Jesus wept.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.660]   So we shouldn't just pass this by and say, "Jesus wept."
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.840]   There's a reason why this one verse,
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.520]   this shortest English verse, is highlighted,
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.340]   because it has tremendous significance.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.600]   There's only two places,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.560]   one other place outside of here
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.980]   where the same word for weeping is used of Christ,
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.120]   and that was used last week at the Palm Sunday
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.440]   when Jesus looked at the multitude crying out to him,
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.720]   "Hosanna, Hosanna," it says, "Jesus wept."
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.200]   Now, we can understand Jesus is in front of
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.920]   the burial site of Lazarus, whom he loved.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.660]   So it makes sense that he would weep,
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.280]   because he saw the sorrow of the people.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.000]   And we can just superficially say,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.040]   "Oh, he was sad," like we would be sad.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.300]   But what is perplexing was Jesus himself said,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.960]   "He's not going to die."
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.640]   You know, if he was crying because of their sadness,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.560]   you would think that Jesus would kind of have a smirk
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.960]   on the side of his face, "Just wait, right?
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.520]   "I know you're sad, but just wait.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.120]   "I took two days on purpose."
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.800]   So did he forget?
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.440]   Or was he just emotionally overwhelmed
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.640]   and he just kind of like couldn't help it
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.320]   because they were weeping?
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.880]   What is the meaning behind his weeping?
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.800]   You see, both times when Jesus was weeping,
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.640]   he saw judgment coming.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.440]   The Bible says that because of man's rebellion,
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.660]   the final judgment on all mankind is death.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:20.900]   Right now, 100% of us who are born will die.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:24.140]   And that's not a guess.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.800]   100% of us at some point, whether we die early,
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.480]   whether we die late, we will die.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.200]   There's not a single human being that lived among us
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.360]   who didn't experience the termination of his life
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.400]   one way or the other.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:41.360]   The Bible says the clearest evidence
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.180]   of the ramification of man's sin is death.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:48.800]   So I believe that Jesus was weeping for the same reason
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.400]   that he was weeping on his way to Jerusalem.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.400]   He was weeping because at the face of death,
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.720]   he sees the judgment on mankind.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.480]   It wasn't simply weeping because he was temporarily asleep,
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.680]   like he said, 'cause he was just about to raise him.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:12.680]   I don't know about you, but it gives me tremendous,
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.080]   tremendous comfort to know
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.600]   that Jesus did not simply satisfy the legal code
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.440]   that God required.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:26.140]   He didn't just come into the court and say,
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.080]   "You know what?
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.900]   "I'm a public defender, so I'm gonna do my best
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.720]   "to defend him and then go my way."
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.960]   That's not what happened.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.920]   He didn't just satisfy the legal requirement
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.680]   that we needed to save us from eternal judgment.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:47.840]   The Bible says he saw our sins and he had compassion on us.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.100]   His compassion is what led to his weeping.
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.200]   I don't know about you, but it gives me tremendous comfort
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.660]   to know that my Savior loves me to this degree.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:07.340]   He wept for me and he wept for you.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.260]   And that's why we celebrate this day.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:14.140]   What was so ugly on Friday
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.700]   turns into the greatest celebration on Sunday
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.500]   because Christ wept for us.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:25.060]   You know, every single one of us,
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.460]   we know the darkness that's inside.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:31.580]   We know that in private,
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.200]   there are things that we don't wanna show the public.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.240]   So when we come to church, we put on the best dress,
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.200]   we put on, you know, do our hair,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.460]   and we make sure that we speak a certain way,
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.200]   we look a certain way, we act a certain way,
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.840]   all of it because we don't want you to see
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.900]   behind the curtain.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:51.460]   Because there's a nervousness in all of us
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.440]   that there are certain parts of our lives
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.260]   that once they see, they might not want to be with us.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.560]   There's a certain fear in all of us
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.720]   that once the curtain is drawn
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.800]   and they're able to see every aspect,
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.120]   every thought that I have,
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.480]   everything that I do that people don't know of,
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.500]   they don't wanna be my friend.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.300]   They wouldn't want me in this community.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.180]   Every one of us has that fear.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:20.160]   And to be honest, to many degrees, it's true.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.640]   And that's why marriage oftentimes is so hard
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.760]   because you can't hide from your husband and your wife
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.240]   like you do everybody else.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.560]   You may do a good job with everybody else
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.100]   to keep enough distance and you've done a great job,
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.280]   but you get married, you can't hide.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.120]   And eventually, it comes out.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.480]   And when it comes out, there's that temptation.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.540]   This is not what I thought.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:50.440]   Christ saw every ugliness in a sinner like me and you.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.960]   And instead of being disgusted,
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.420]   he wept over us,
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.700]   embraced us even harder.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.300]   He drew near
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:07.500]   and he took our sorrows upon himself.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:12.580]   It's a tremendous comfort to know
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.400]   that this is the degree to which he loves us.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.420]   Finally, in scene five, Lazarus is raised,
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   what we've been waiting for.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.840]   All of that was a setup for this.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.860]   So Jesus, again, being deeply moved within,
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.460]   came to the tomb.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.780]   Now it was a cave and a stone was lying against it.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:36.080]   And Jesus said, "Remove the stone."
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.260]   Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him,
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.380]   "Lord, by this time, there will be a stench."
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.900]   You know what's funny about this?
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.720]   Because in the Old English, in the KJV, it says,
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.000]   "Lord, it stinketh."
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.880]   That's what it says.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.380]   In the King James Version, it's very direct.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.520]   "Lord, it's been four days.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.720]   "It stinketh."
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:04.400]   I don't know what it sounds like in Greek,
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.080]   but in the Old English, it's very direct.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.980]   "He stinks.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.840]   "If you roll that stone away now,
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.540]   "I mean, he's not gonna be Lazarus."
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.520]   Remember I told you, Martha is kind of juggling this.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.720]   "I believe you, but he's gonna stink.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.860]   "What are you doing?"
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:29.860]   Lord, verse 40, Jesus said to her,
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.220]   "Did I not say to you that if you believe,
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.840]   "you will see the glory of God?"
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.720]   In other words, do what I say.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.740]   Then Jesus raised his eyes and said,
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.920]   "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.100]   "I knew that you always hear me,
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.900]   "but because of the people standing around,
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:51.960]   "I said it so that they may believe that you sent me."
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.260]   And when he had said these things,
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.440]   he cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.060]   You know what's amazing about this?
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.260]   That's all it took.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:07.720]   Jesus didn't have a prayer meeting.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.740]   He didn't have a fasting.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.940]   He didn't put mud on.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:13.440]   He didn't say, "Give it some time."
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.820]   He didn't say, "Get the oil ready.
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.020]   "Remove the stone, and we're gonna get--"
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.380]   Nothing, he just like, "Step back.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.220]   "I told you what I'm gonna,
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.620]   "you're about to see the glory of God."
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:26.220]   And all he does was, "Lazarus, come out!"
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:27.060]   That's it.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:32.000]   And it may be amazing to us,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.840]   but the Bible says, by the proclamation of his word,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.260]   the whole world was created.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.500]   So it may be amazing to us,
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.580]   but for God, all it took was for him to say, "Come out."
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.900]   It was just simple words, "Come out,"
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.260]   coupled with his authority.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:55.840]   It was not a big deal.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.180]   I mean, that almost sounds blasphemous to say,
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:04.180]   but to God, all he needed to do to raise a dead man
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.100]   who was dead for four days,
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.900]   with complete lost hope for every single person
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.980]   that was there who was weeping and crying
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.100]   because they're so saddened
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.660]   'cause there's no hope in death,
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:17.940]   all Jesus had to do was to say, "Come out."
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.460]   And he came out.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.060]   Look what happens.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.740]   Then the man who had died came forth,
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.580]   bound hand and foot with wrappings,
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.620]   and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.920]   Jesus said to them, "Unbind him and let him go."
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.100]   I don't know what Lazarus was thinking.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.060]   It'd be interesting if we were to do a play with this scene.
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.140]   Right, Lazarus coming up, jumping out from this,
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.500]   and like what he was thinking.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.500]   What is this?
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.740]   What happened?
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.020]   Did you see a bright light at the end of the tunnel
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:52.860]   when you died?
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.740]   What was it like?
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:57.260]   He'd be an interesting person to ask,
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.260]   right, 'cause everybody's guessing,
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.500]   but he actually died for four days.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.540]   Well, what were you doing?
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:03.380]   Right?
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.980]   Did you see Moses?
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.340]   Was Elijah there?
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.900]   You know what's interesting?
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:09.780]   He comes out.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.180]   And then you would think they threw a party
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.780]   and there was a revival that broke out.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.740]   Nothing.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:16.660]   He came out.
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.620]   Many people saw the glory and they believed.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:26.740]   And then some of them went to the Pharisees and told them.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.640]   Wow.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.700]   Even after that,
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.420]   even after that,
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:37.020]   people who are already committed,
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.180]   already shut their hearts,
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:41.780]   even in the face of a great miracle,
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:44.680]   they were gonna go down that path.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.580]   Why did God allow this?
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:52.620]   He allowed them to experience desperation,
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.820]   sadness, disappointment, grieving.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:02.900]   All of that was God-ordained for the purpose of his glory.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.620]   It was ordained.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.560]   Much of our suffering is ordained for his glory.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.480]   Much of the persecution in the church
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.120]   has been ordained for his glory.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:19.400]   Even Lazarus's death was ordained for his glory.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.560]   Story just moves on.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.800]   You know, you would think that
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.680]   if you were to read any story
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.180]   and you have five scenes,
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.740]   that Lazarus comes back from the dead, the end.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.620]   It's like, how can it get any higher than this?
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.260]   But all of this was a precursor about the real story.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:44.500]   'Cause he moves on from here.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.360]   And this is where he begins to prepare
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.140]   and he goes into Jerusalem,
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.480]   because all of this was to prepare for them
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.400]   for the real hope that is coming in Christ.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:00.400]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 52 to 57, it says,
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.020]   "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.260]   "at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound,
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.800]   "and the dead will be raised imperishable,
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.400]   "and we will be changed.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.360]   "For this perishable must put on the imperishable,
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.360]   "and this mortal must put on immortality.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.000]   "But when the perishable will have put on the imperishable,
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.680]   "and this mortal will have put on immortality,
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.760]   "then will come about the saying that is written,
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.920]   "death is swallowed up in victory.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.580]   "Oh, death, where is your victory?
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.740]   "Oh, death, where is your sting?
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.800]   "The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.700]   "But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.760]   "through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.080]   Lazarus's resurrection was just for himself.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.180]   Jesus's resurrection was for all of us.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:54.340]   He took the sting of death away.
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:58.840]   Now, even as Christians, we don't wanna die.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:02.280]   We wanna spend as much time as we can with our children,
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.680]   with our friends and family.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.540]   But the sting of death has been taken away,
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.640]   because death leads us
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.500]   to the eternal presence of Christ Jesus.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:18.420]   Colossians 3, 4 says, "When Christ, who is your life,
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.060]   "appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:25.860]   I pray that the resurrection of Christ
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.240]   would not just simply be something
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.740]   that we remember and celebrate,
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:33.740]   like we do, like July 4th, or our anniversaries,
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.540]   and then we move on to the rest of our life.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:40.020]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ changes everything.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.240]   The Bible says that we were buried with him,
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:47.820]   so that we may also be raised with him,
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.760]   not to a better life, but to a completely new life.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:57.940]   My prayer is that all of you out there listening,
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.380]   our church members outside the church,
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.760]   do you know this Christ?
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.380]   If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:09.300]   and believe in your heart
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:12.800]   that Christ was raised from the dead, you will be saved.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.260]   Are you weighed down by your sin?
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.220]   Are you afraid of death,
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.320]   because you don't know what's coming after?
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.880]   I pray that you would meet this resurrected Christ.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.140]   I pray that you would meet this Christ,
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.220]   that you and I would have this conviction,
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.700]   that have this hope eternal.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:37.860]   Take some time to pray with me as we seek the Lord together.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:43.860]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.740]   Millions of us all around the world thank you in unison.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.940]   All the saints that have gone before us
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.140]   with cloud of witnesses,
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:54.400]   all the saints that will come after us,
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.740]   in unison we praise you and we thank you
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.180]   for not turning away when you saw our sins,
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:05.700]   but having compassion,
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:11.680]   for taking upon yourselves our sorrows, our griefs,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.220]   that you may be a sympathetic high priest.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:19.500]   I pray, Father God, that as you invite us
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:23.100]   to come to the throne of grace with confidence,
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.180]   that that is exactly what we will commit to do,
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.460]   to continue to come to you,
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.980]   that we may have this life and have it abundantly.
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:33.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.060]   - Again, for those who are at home,
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:41.460]   if you could stand with us in your home,
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:44.060]   and we'll close with this final song.

[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:20.240]   Gracious and loving Father, as the world celebrates and remembers the resurrection
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:27.960]   of Christ, as he was resurrected, that we may live a new life, I pray that this new
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:37.400]   life will be more evident than ever as the world is concerned and anxious over this pandemic
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.040]   that's going on around the world.
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:44.840]   Help us Lord God, that we would not live in fear.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:50.520]   Help us Lord to live looking for opportunities to be a light around us.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:55.440]   I pray Father God that the impact of this resurrection will be tangibly seen in our
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.320]   lives Lord God in every aspect.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.560]   We pray again for our health workers that you would keep them safe.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:06.080]   Give them compassion Lord for those who are dying, for those who are suffering that they
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:11.720]   may be the presence and aroma of Christ where it is direly needed.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:17.280]   We pray for those who are continuing to work Lord God that you would give them opportunities
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.880]   to share the gospel with their coworkers, that in their actions and in their speech
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:25.000]   that the love of Christ may be evident.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.680]   And for many of us who are home just waiting for this quarantine to lift, help us Lord
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:39.500]   God not to simply spend the time but to invest in it in prayer, in word that our fellowship
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.180]   with you would deepen as a result.
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:48.680]   We pray Father God that as you send us wherever it is that you send us, that the love of Christ
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:53.240]   would deeply impact every part of our lives inside and out.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the eternal
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.160]   love of God the Father, rest, restore and strengthen your church for the sake of Christ's
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160]   glory.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   Amen.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:09.900]   God sent his son.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:15.120]   They called him Jesus.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:26.120]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:36.120]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:47.120]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior live.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:57.120]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:08.120]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:30.120]   Because I know he holds the future and life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:58.120]   Because I know he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:10.120]   Because I know he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:34.120]   Because I know he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:58.120]   Because I know he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:10.120]   Because I know he lives, I can face tomorrow.
