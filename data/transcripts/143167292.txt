[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Genesis chapter 16.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.160]   And as you're turning over there, I want to say I'm so glad that every single one of you
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.660]   are here in this room.
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.880]   There are moments in which this room, it is a spiritual house, but this room can become
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.040]   a scary place.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.960]   Every Thursday and Friday I lock up the building, and some nights we lock it up real late, and
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.920]   especially on Fridays when the collegians are hanging out, we have a great time and everybody
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.120]   leaves, it can be like 11 o'clock, sometimes even later than that.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.500]   And after everybody leaves, I turn off all the lights and I come over walking this way
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.440]   to set the alarm, and in my mind I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   go."
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.040]   Because it's not just dark, I mean at that time it's just pitch black.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.400]   In a big room for some reason there's a weird hum.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.800]   Have you guys ever felt that?
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.920]   And then in certain bigger rooms you hear weird creaking noises, and you're just like,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   "Hurry!"
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920]   And then you just want to go.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.480]   Well, at some nights, some people are gracious and then they say, "Hey, I'll just lock up
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   with you."
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480]   Like Alex does that a lot.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.360]   And I look over at him and I'll be like, "I'm so glad you're here."
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.120]   It's because it's just kind of unsettling, you know what I mean?
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.320]   The fear of the unknown in the pitch black ginormous room.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.180]   And I'll tell you a hilarious story.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.380]   One time we cleared the entire sanctuary for an event, and I was locking up after, and
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.480]   I set the alarm and I just started running.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.080]   I started running that way, and lo and behold, all of a sudden, boom!
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.020]   And I just fall head over, and I'm like rolling over like, "What is that?"
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.260]   Someone left one chair, like right smack in the middle.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.260]   And nobody saw.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.220]   I just ducked my head and slowly walked out the church all hurting.
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.340]   And it was just a miserable time.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.180]   I tell you these stories because sometimes having somebody with you just helps a lot.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.180]   Okay?
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.700]   I mean, it's not like if seriously, I don't know, a demon or somebody comes out that just
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.340]   having one person is going to save the day, but it's just what helps.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.780]   And the thing about it is we live in a generation, and we've always lived in a generation, in
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.300]   a world with a lot of pain, with a lot of hurt, with various things that frustrate,
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.300]   with all this anxiety.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.780]   And in reality, it just helps a lot to have somebody around.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.700]   And the story that I want to read to you is a story about an interesting character that's
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.180]   typically not highlighted in the Bible.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180]   Her name is Hagar.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.740]   She is an Egyptian slave.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.900]   She is a maidservant.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.060]   And although in previous times I've read this passage, I might have glossed over her character,
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.900]   this time I want to highlight for you that this is an individual who experienced a great
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.860]   amount of affliction, but found help in the presence of one.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.820]   Let's take a moment to read this story.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.340]   Go over again in chapter 16.
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.260]   In verse 1, this is what it says in chapter 16.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.680]   "Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had born him no children, and she had an Egyptian mate whose
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   name was Hagar."
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.420]   I'm going to give you a little background story and then read the rest of the passage.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.060]   It starts with Abraham, who at this moment is still Abram, okay?
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.180]   He was called, he got a call from God, not the phone call, he got a call from God from
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.980]   when he was living in the Ur of Chaldees, which is modern day Saudi Arabia, and God
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.740]   said you need to leave your family, you need to leave your home, and I want you to journey
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.620]   because I'm going to give you a land.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.420]   I'm going to give you an amazing land, but more than that, I'm going to give you a son
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.140]   and people, and many descendants will be yours.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.580]   Abraham, Abram, had that promise, he was already married, but even 10 years after, she was
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.580]   barren.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.580]   So there was frustration in Sarai.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.060]   She was wondering what's going on, didn't we receive the promise 10 years past, nothing
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.420]   is happening, so remember what she says, she has a brilliant idea.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.900]   She says, "I've got this maidservant, why don't you have her be a surrogate mother and
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.060]   have a baby through her?"
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.700]   And like a dodo, Abram says, "Okay," and then he has a baby through this maidservant, and
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.260]   you would imagine what could happen there.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.260]   A lot of strife.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.580]   What ends up actually happening is, Hagar, the maidservant, she too is not a good character
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.700]   so far because she ends up getting a sense of pride.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.100]   She looks at her master, who is Sarai, and says, "This is how you do it, this is how
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.860]   you have babies," you know, she's boasting, and then in the scriptures it says that she
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.300]   looked on her master with despise, okay, she was despicable in her eyes.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.900]   And so Sarai, upset, all of a sudden looks at her husband, "Look what you did," and he's
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.460]   going, "What, what, I didn't do anything," he's like, "This is your fault, you know,
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.300]   judge between me and God, look what happened, ahhh," and then we pick up our story, okay?
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.860]   Verse 6, it says, "But Abram said to Sarai, 'Behold, your maid is yours in your power,
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.300]   do to her what is good in your sight.'
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.500]   So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence."
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.740]   So Hagar flees into the wilderness.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.420]   Verse 7, "Now the angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness,
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.380]   by the spring on the way ashore.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.860]   He said, 'Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from, and where are you going?'
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.220]   And she said, 'I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.'
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.380]   Then the angel of the Lord said to her, 'Return to your mistress and submit yourself to her
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.380]   authority.'"
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.380]   Dang.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.220]   Verse 10, "Moreover, the angel of the Lord said to her, 'I will greatly multiply your
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.180]   descendants so that they will be too many to count.'
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.540]   The angel of the Lord said to her further, 'Behold, you are with child, and you will
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:56.060]   bear a son, and you shall call his name Ishmael, because the Lord has given heed to your affliction.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.740]   He will be a wild donkey of a man, his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.380]   will be against him, and he will live to the east of all his brothers.'
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.180]   Then she called on the name of the Lord who spoke to her, 'You are a God who sees.'
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.860]   For she said, 'Have I even remained alive here after seeing him?'
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.380]   Therefore the well has been called Bir Laharoi.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.820]   Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.620]   So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael."
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.980]   Let's take a moment to pray that God will bless our time in the Word.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.580]   Father God, we want to take a moment to pray that as we read Old Testament stories, help
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.220]   us to glean insights that would affect us.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.020]   Mainly, help us to see who you are in this story.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.020]   God, your character of mercy and love for all of us here, may our hearts be encouraged
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.200]   and lifted up by the reading of your Word.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.740]   We also lift up the church at BMC.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.340]   God, that your spirit and presence would be there.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.220]   Lord, that that church would experience you.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.780]   Lord God, we pray, Father Lord, that for Pastor Aaron and the family in the midst of time
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.580]   in which they suffer, would your presence ever be more clear.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.940]   And God, we pray for Pastor Peter that as he ministers, as he preaches the Word and
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.740]   encourages, would you use them as your hand and feet.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.240]   We thank you in Christ's name, Amen.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.780]   So we read this story, and there's amazing stuff to be learned here.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.540]   But the thing about it is, the multiple times that I read it, I read it as this is the pinnacle
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.500]   story of how God called us to faith, and then we botch it.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   Okay?
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.420]   Because Abraham, in many ways, was the father of faith, and he is to us an example of somebody
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.620]   who through faith is considered righteous.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.720]   And we know that here in chapter 16, this is an epitome of a very typical prototype
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.940]   story of how they did not exercise faith.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.100]   They exercised their own will and then made a mess of it.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.140]   So, silly Abe, why did you listen to your wife?
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.520]   You know?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.180]   And then you have silly Sarai, how come you couldn't wait?
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.860]   Why have this silly idea of having your maidservant do what God said he would eventually do for
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.860]   you?
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.420]   Yes, it's the time.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.780]   Yes, it's all the waiting.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.220]   Yes, it's all the frustration.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.740]   Yes, Sarai probably received a lot of other ridicule and mocking.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.300]   How come the wife of the patriarch isn't having children?
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.300]   Where's the promise?
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   Where's all this?
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.060]   I bet you she was mocked, because even Hagar felt this sense of mockery towards her.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:45.580]   And then, Hagar, you silly lady, if so, you know, they asked you to do this, why have
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.580]   this arrogance?
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.860]   And the reason why I highlight that is because this story typically is preached by way of
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.940]   saying they were asked to have faith, they failed to have faith, and then so here come
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.700]   the consequences.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.700]   Many strife.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.220]   Sarai and Abram are like fighting each other, you did this, and Abram's like, what did I
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.220]   do?
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.220]   You did this, you know?
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.580]   And then strife between Hagar and the master.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.820]   Not only that, but Ishmael is born, and we know, if you guys know the story, that he
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.700]   is not the promised line.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.260]   As a matter of fact, if you read Arabic traditions, so, you know, all the different religions
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.260]   around that Middle Eastern area, Islam, and the various religions that are associated
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.700]   with it, they trace their ancestry to Ishmael.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.420]   The great prophet of Islam, Muhammad, he traces his ancestry to Ishmael.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.300]   And so what you see is, not only are your consequences immediate, and your relationships
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:48.220]   are not all broken because of your lack of faith, you create a future genealogy of strife.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.700]   A different nation to which the Israelites are gonna continue to fight.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.220]   Ah, frustrated with your lack of faith.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.740]   That's how typically the story is taught.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.660]   But now when I read this story, I find something quite amazing, something altogether different,
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.020]   which is this.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:10.340]   If you look at verse nine, an angel of the Lord appears.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.140]   Or I guess verse seven, the angel of the Lord appears.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.980]   And then in verse eight, he asks Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come and where are you
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.980]   going?
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.420]   Hagar is in the wilderness.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.820]   She's wandering the wilderness.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.800]   There's a sense in which she's essentially being cast out, and without somebody providing
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.820]   for her, a tribe or a clan, so to speak, a family, she has no chance of survival.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.900]   She's literally in the desert, wandering to die.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.420]   Angel of the Lord appears, where are you going?
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.420]   I'm just fleeing.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.460]   That's what Hagar says.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.500]   But then what's profound is starting from verse nine, the angel starts to speak to her,
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.660]   and then he first tells her a correction.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.040]   Return to your mistress and submit yourself to her authority.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.260]   Make it right.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.380]   But then furthermore, verse 10, moreover the angel of the Lord said to her, I will greatly
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.900]   multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.540]   Does that strike you as a bit unusual and shocking?
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:15.620]   To me it does because remember, Sarai is not a part of Abraham's family.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.420]   Sarai is an Egyptian slave.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.700]   She's an Egyptian slave.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.580]   She's not part of that line.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.140]   But then when he gives her a promise, like I'm going to greatly multiply you and your
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.660]   descendants will be so numerous you can't count it, what does that sound like?
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.220]   That sounds like the promise he gave his promised people, and more specifically his promised
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.460]   person, Abraham.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:46.980]   So what I'm saying is, the focus of the story all of a sudden changes to, it's not simply
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.620]   that God is frustrated with the lack of trust of Abraham and Sarai.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:57.540]   More so the focus of the story is on God intervening with his grace and mercy, promising stuff
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.980]   that wasn't even deserving.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.860]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.660]   And so if you look at this further, look at verse 11.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.340]   The angel of the Lord spoke to her further, "Behold," okay, holds her attention, "you
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.820]   are with child, your child will bear a son and you shall call his name Ishmael."
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.100]   And in every single one of your Bibles, no matter what translation you have, you should
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.700]   probably have a little subscript or a little number.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.260]   And it sometimes tells you what those Hebrew names mean.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.180]   If you have a, again, like a reference Bible, it tells you.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:37.260]   That name means God hears.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.940]   God hears.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.980]   So that's my first point for the sermon.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.220]   A truth to encourage your hearts this morning.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.940]   God hears.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.140]   Sarai did not give that son a name.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.980]   Abraham didn't give that son a name.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.020]   Hagar did not give that son a name.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:00.540]   God, through the angel, gave that son a name, which means God wanted to make a point for
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.140]   us to remember.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.220]   Hagar is not gonna forget.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.260]   I was wandering the desert, left to die.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.260]   I was a servant.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.100]   I mean, think about this for a moment.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.100]   She was a servant asked to do something that even, yes, although in that day and age, that
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.260]   stuff kind of happened.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.260]   Can you imagine?
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.380]   "You can't have children, so you're gonna do it."
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.380]   It's like, what?
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.420]   How do you ask someone to do that?
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.420]   You're gonna make me go through childbirth and labor and that son's not really even gonna
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.420]   be mine?
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.060]   Whoa.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.100]   But even then, after that, she's mistreated and then she's cast out and left essentially
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.100]   to die.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.460]   And then in that midst, God hears.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.540]   That's point number one.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.820]   That God is a God who hears.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:54.580]   When I look out into this congregation this morning, with my eyes, I see a gathering of
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.860]   people well-dressed, prepared for service, which is good.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.620]   You guys are presenting your best before God.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.580]   You guys are in your Sunday best.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.940]   You guys have combed your hair, all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   Save a few.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.260]   I'm just kidding.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.900]   But that's what I see with my eyes.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.140]   I see this.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.740]   And when I see this, I'm all encouraged.
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.740]   I feel great.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.140]   I feel like, yeah, I'm with the household of God worshiping.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.740]   But I know that people in here still internally struggle.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.660]   Some of us struggle with our jobs.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.380]   Some of us struggle financially.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.060]   Some of us struggle in our marriages, relationships, families.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.420]   Some of us struggle with our own sins and vices.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.060]   Some of us struggle in so many different ways.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:41.340]   The thing about it is, in the midst of that struggle, I want to encourage you this morning,
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.820]   God sees through everything.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.060]   God has perfect knowledge.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.220]   Can I point out something to you?
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:55.740]   That God saw us, had our situation and circumstance, a sense of desperation.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.300]   God saw her fear.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.300]   God saw her affliction.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.420]   And so the passage says to us very clearly, I'm naming him Ishmael because the Lord has
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.260]   given heed to your affliction.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.220]   Yes, amen.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.980]   But God has a perfect knowledge of Hagar.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.140]   He sees her unborn child.
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.780]   He sees their future.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.620]   He understands her completely.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.340]   I want to encourage you this morning.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.500]   God sees through every circumstance.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.860]   God sees through every pain, every affliction, every hurt, every moment of feeling isolation,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.940]   every moment of desperation.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.940]   God sees it.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.060]   And I want our hearts to be encouraged with that truth this morning.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.780]   But you know, there's even more, something just more profound about just simply that
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.780]   point.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.780]   Okay, God hears.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:50.140]   But the fact of the matter is, if I am honest, a lot of my suffering and the hardship and
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.980]   afflictions, it's self-imposed.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.380]   In the sense that there are situations to which the affliction and the hurt that's in
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.860]   your life, you just have no control over.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.060]   And so perhaps Hagar, she feels like that.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.820]   That lady Sarai, my master, what a wicked lady.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.740]   And she's sitting there thinking, she's making my life miserable.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.740]   Okay?
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.660]   But Hagar also has to own up to the fact that her arrogance and pride cause a rift in the
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.660]   relationship.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.220]   Sarai, she might be complaining, "Yeah, look what you did.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.220]   Look at all this stuff."
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.740]   And Abraham could be sitting there like, "Hello?
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.300]   What did you expect?
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.500]   You literally had a maidservant replace you.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.060]   What did you expect?"
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.700]   It's a lot like some of the complaints we have.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.380]   It makes me think of in recent history, the last couple months, I've had a lot of expenditures
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.900]   from moving car things and repairs.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.900]   Sometimes I complain, I'm like, "Oh, why is it so expensive?"
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.260]   And it's really expensive to get four new tires for a minivan.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.740]   It's really expensive.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.780]   And then on top of that, we needed brakes.
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:03.340]   So realizing, "Oh my gosh, having new brakes and pads and rotors for a minivan is crazy
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.340]   expensive."
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.500]   So I start to verbalize my expression of frustration.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.700]   Like, "Oh my gosh, those auto mechanics, they're just ripping me off because I know how to
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   do pads.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.260]   It's much cheaper than that, but it's like this much money.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.500]   And then tires, oh my gosh, I can't believe it's that much money.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.220]   And I can sit here and complain and feel like, 'Woe is me.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.060]   How am I going to afford all this?'"
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.260]   And then someone can look at me and be like, "But you like that minivan.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.000]   You love that minivan.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You bought that minivan."
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It's like, "I did.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I love it."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.500]   You guys know, I mean, some of you guys don't know, but I've been wanting a minivan since
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   I was in high school.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.980]   It's kind of like one of my life goals accomplished.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.900]   But you get what I'm saying.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.340]   Sometimes we feel like we're in a world of hurt, but looking at the scenario, it's due
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.020]   to our own devices.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.380]   It's sometimes due to our reactions.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.220]   It's sometimes due to our poor choices.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.340]   And yes, it is sometimes due to, just like with Abram and Sarai, lack of faith.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.340]   But not always.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.660]   Why I bring that up?
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:15.000]   Because in this scenario, the consequences of the family rift and the consequences of
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.900]   being cast out, consequences, our fault.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.100]   Nevertheless, God shows up.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.580]   This is our God.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.540]   Nevertheless, God hears.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.060]   Do we read in the Bible, "You made a mess of it.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.300]   I told you so.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.540]   Now fix it.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.420]   You better get that straight before you come to me."
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.100]   A lot of time, God says, "I'm your father.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.800]   Why don't you ask me?"
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   He sees it.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   He hears it.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   He knows it.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   He understands.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.760]   Even when a lot of that pain and affliction is due to our own devices.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.760]   This is our God.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.460]   He is the one who hears.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.580]   Now I want to just highlight to you how important this theme is in this passage, because it's
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.500]   just like shouting at me now when I read this.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.060]   So take a look again at the chapter.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.260]   It says again, "Behold, you're going to have this son, and God names him Ishmael."
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.940]   And God says, "Because the Lord has given heed to your affliction, God hears and sees
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.260]   what you're going through."
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.860]   And then her response, Haggad's response, go over to verse 13.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.580]   It says, "Then she called on the name of the Lord."
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.940]   She says, "Called on the name of the Lord."
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.580]   Lord is cap and all caps because that's the name of Yahweh.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.980]   But then it says, "She called on the name of the Lord who spoke to her.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.980]   You are a God who sees."
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.300]   And that we have to pay attention to.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.140]   Because in the Hebrew, it just simply reads, "You God see me."
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.860]   Or like, "You God see."
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.980]   But in that right center, there is a focus on God's name.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.620]   And the name is El Roy.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.660]   If you're taking notes, write that down.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.940]   E-L-R-O-I.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.660]   El Roy.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.340]   She calls on the name of the Lord, Yahweh, and then she calls him something else.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.980]   El Roy.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.660]   Yahweh, El Roy.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.660]   Why does she do that?
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.980]   Because she is emphasizing one point, one singular thing she's focused on in the midst
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.580]   of her pain, in the midst of her devastation and feeling desperate.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.540]   She experiences God and then she calls him something, which is El Roy.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.420]   And that El Roy simply means, "The God who sees."
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.900]   You, the God who sees, see me.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.900]   Quite beautiful.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:40.420]   I want to encourage your hearts that as Hagar is experiencing that, have you ever felt that?
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.580]   Some of us, we feel isolation.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.980]   When you're in pain, sometimes the knee jerk reaction is like, "Oh, I'm in pain."
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.100]   But then it's just me, right?
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.540]   And oftentimes we are designed to have someone know what we're going through because we know
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.540]   that's going to help.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   But even that's hard.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:02.300]   How many of you guys have had a difficulty sharing because part of you says, "Why bother
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   sharing?
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   I don't know if they can understand.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.300]   I have to explain the background.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   I have to explain what I'm thinking.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   I have to explain what they did.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   I don't want to go through all that.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.780]   And even if I did go through all that, maybe they won't even understand."
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.780]   It's true.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.280]   Maybe they won't.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.540]   Because for us, although it's good to share with our brothers and sisters, don't stop
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.020]   doing that.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.460]   People are simply trying their best to understand.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.580]   Hagar is saying, "God, you see me.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.220]   You know me.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.980]   You understand me."
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.460]   This is a beautiful passage.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.260]   "Therefore," verse 14, "therefore the well, the place to which she was at, was called
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.100]   Bir Lahoroi."
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.300]   And that probably has another subscript, a little asterisk on it.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.060]   It says, "Behold, as being cadet, she had been bereft to say, 'This place still stands
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.060]   today.'"
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.260]   Do you know what that means?
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:57.060]   It means the well to which the living one sees.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.720]   So by His name, by her response, by the way that she names even the location to which
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.520]   she stands, it just screams at this truth.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.760]   We need to understand God hears and sees the afflictions of His people.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:24.240]   I want to just encourage you guys again that for us, perhaps some of us, we are hurting
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.360]   and we have difficulties in our private life.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.000]   And sometimes we have inclinations and desires to let people in and have them help us, but
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.280]   sometimes we're even afraid of that because after all the efforts, it might not help.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.560]   I want to encourage you.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.960]   God has blessed the people of faith with the congregation, the brothers and sisters of
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.640]   Christ, so that we might all continue to encourage each other in love.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   But to me, one of the profound things of a fellowship of a church that does that is that
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.040]   we make the reality of God's presence all the more real in those moments of pain.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.160]   And so I want to encourage you, if some of you guys are hurting in private, if some of
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.360]   you guys have certain afflictions, remember that God is Yahweh El Roy, the God who sees
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.480]   your afflictions.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:21.240]   He saw Hagar's fears, He saw Hagar's worries, He saw everything about her and even the generations
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.000]   to come.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.960]   And she was encouraged simply with that.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.280]   In the end, she had to go back.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.560]   Isn't that an interesting point?
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.440]   She had to go back to a Brahman Sarai.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.120]   It wasn't simply that, okay, I'm going to promise all this stuff and whabam, peace.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.280]   God encouraged her with His knowledge of her and His presence.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.200]   The story continues to go.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.560]   The story doesn't stop there.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   Please turn in your Bibles to Genesis chapter 21, verse 9.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.840]   Genesis chapter 21, verse 9.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.040]   Okay?
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.280]   Okay.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:14.600]   And to give you a little backdrop, in Genesis chapter 16, Ishmael is born and then 13 years
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.760]   pass from then until chapter 21.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.360]   Within those 13 years, there's a lot of stuff more so pertaining to Abram and his, again,
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.480]   being a chosen person, a figure that God wants to create a nation through.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.680]   And then finally, at the beginning of chapter 21, they have a son.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.160]   Isaac is born.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.280]   Isaac is a baby.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.520]   He's just being weaned.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.440]   So maybe about one years old, you know, whenever children are weaned off the mother's milk.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.880]   But what's really interesting about this story is, so now you have potential for greater
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   drama.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:51.240]   And here we pick up chapter 21.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   Let's see.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.320]   Chapter 21, verse 1, it says, "Then the Lord took note of Sarah, and as he had said, the
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.880]   Lord did for Sarah as he had promised.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.840]   So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the appointed time of which
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.920]   God had spoken of him."
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.440]   So now you know what's happening.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:18.280]   Verse 9, "Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had born to Abraham, mocking.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.080]   For she said to Abraham, 'Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.760]   not be an heir with my son Isaac.'"
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.880]   Oof, drama is unfolding.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.960]   Essentially what you have is, so far, 13 years have passed, so Ishmael is probably 13, 14
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   years old.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.280]   So here he is, fully comprehending everything that's going on.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.800]   Now this baby is born, but the baby seems to be now the true heir of the family.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.320]   So you can imagine Ishmael thinking, "Oh, seriously?
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   It's a baby."
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   Right?
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.040]   So he's looking down on the baby of promise, and then Sarah sees that, and as a mom, she's
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040]   just like, "Fah!"
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   You know?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.880]   She gets upset, she's like, "How dare he mock my son!"
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.400]   And then she goes to Abraham and says, "Get rid of the whole family.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.120]   Mom, son, I want them out of here.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.080]   They're not gonna be a heir with my son."
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.840]   Well, let's keep reading here.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.840]   Orally, laugh.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   Verse 11.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.160]   Verse 11 says, "The matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.800]   But God said to Abraham, 'Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.160]   Whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.800]   For through Isaac your descendants shall be named.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.280]   And the son of the maid, I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant.'"
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   Okay?
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.200]   So you notice what's happening?
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.240]   Because Abraham was without a son, and Ishmael essentially was the only son, I'm guessing
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.360]   Abraham connected with Ishmael.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.000]   He had an affinity and said, "Oh, I can't do that.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.360]   This is technically my son."
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   Right?
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.840]   But then God says something very interesting, which is God affirms Ishmael is not the promised
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.960]   line.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.440]   So he says, "Do what Sarah says and cast her out."
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.440]   Ouch.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   Right?
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.440]   Ouch.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   So, verse 14.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.680]   "So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and the skin of water and gave
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.560]   them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder and gave her the boy and sent her away.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.800]   And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   Then the water and the skin was all used up.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.580]   She left the boy under one of the bushes.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.280]   Then she went and sat down opposite him about a bow shot away.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.000]   For she said, 'Do not let me see the boy die.'
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.600]   And she sat opposite him and lifted up her voice and wept."
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.960]   Let's take a moment to pause there.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:41.840]   God promised Hagar that her son would be blessed and would have many descendants.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.080]   But where is Hagar now?
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   She's walking the wilderness.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.660]   Friends, the simple truth that we have the promises of God does not mean you're going
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.620]   to be free from difficulty, heartache, and pain.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.960]   Those will exist.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:01.040]   And in this moment, can we all affirm the fact that perhaps the vast majority of us
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.800]   have not been afflicted to the degree she is now?
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.640]   Some of us have been hurt.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.520]   Some of us have felt distress.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.240]   Maybe we felt in many ways isolated, outcast, whatever it may be.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.280]   But that hurt, probably speaking, is not as great as this.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.960]   Let's take a moment to just imagine what she's gone through.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.880]   She's being cast out of her home with nothing but her son and a water bag and some perhaps
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   provisions.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.800]   But the thing about it is it's not like as though some kid was running away from home
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.320]   in this day where they can just go to a buddy's house.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.320]   They can go to McDonald's.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   They can go to the library.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.400]   They can crash somewhere.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.400]   This is the desert.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.320]   There's nothing but rock.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.360]   There's dangerous animals.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.920]   And for a woman with a young child to go out, it is again, second time death.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.520]   She's going out and remember, her boy is 14.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.500]   When I first read this story, I remember thinking, "Oh, that's so sad.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.520]   She let her little infant down by the bush."
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.080]   It wasn't an infant.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.480]   And the reason why that matters is because you can imagine that how exhausted, how dehydrated,
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.120]   how spent and weak they must have been that she had to lay down a full-grown boy next
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.480]   to a bush.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.800]   And then think about the mother's pain to walk away from her son.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.000]   Oh, it chokes me up just thinking about it.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   To turn her back and walk away from her son.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.360]   And we read later on that the boy was crying.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.640]   The boy was crying.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:35.680]   So she goes a bow shot away and she prays essentially and says, "Please, don't let
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.720]   me see my son die."
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.360]   Because seriously, the nightmare of every parent is to see their child go before them.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:51.760]   So she's essentially saying with that statement, "I would rather die first than my own son."
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.280]   Hagar's affliction is intense.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.560]   It's so intense.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.120]   She is at her wit's end.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.640]   There's nothing she can do.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.000]   She can try desperately to grab strength somehow, but what is she going to do in a moment like
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.200]   that?
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.560]   And that is when our God appears.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.640]   When the pain is so real and so severe.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.120]   Verse 17, "Then God heard the lad crying.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.880]   And the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, 'Hagar, what is the
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.000]   matter?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.040]   Do not fear for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.440]   Arise, lift up the lad and hold him by the hand for I will make a great nation of him.'
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.840]   Then God opened her eyes.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.040]   She saw a well of water.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.760]   She went and filled the skin of water and gave the lad a drink.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.480]   God was with the lad.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.720]   He grew, he lived in the wilderness and became an archer."
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   Amen.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.800]   This story, again, of Hagar to me before was just failure of faith.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:57.200]   The story more so highlights, uplifts God's intervention of mercy through his presence.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.640]   And so the second truth for you to write, the first was God hears.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.360]   The second truth is God is there.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.600]   His very presence is there.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.480]   There is a passage in Ezekiel chapter 48.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.200]   You don't have to turn there because it's a long passage.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.840]   I'm just going to summarize and give you the gist.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.960]   In Ezekiel chapter 48, God is promising the nation that I will restore you.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.480]   You are in pain now.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.000]   You know the history of Israel.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.280]   They were not just felt rejected, they were literally overcome by pagan nations.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.120]   They were held captive and enslaved and they were oppressed and were crying out to God.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.360]   And God through the prophets regularly promised them, 'I will restore you.'
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.200]   And God says, 'I will restore you to a degree where you will have a beautiful city.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.680]   And this city is so real, I'm going to give you the measurements.'
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.520]   So chapter 48 of Ezekiel, God gives the measurements of the pillars.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.280]   God gives the measurements of the temple and the foundation, the courtyard.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.200]   And in that, in the midst of that, do you know what he says?
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   Jot this down as a reference.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   Ezekiel 48, 35.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.800]   And the name of that holy city is the Lord is there.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.520]   That term, the Lord is there, is so unique because it's the only place in the entire
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:16.120]   Bible where that term is used and that term is Yahweh Shammah.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   Jot that down.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.040]   Yahweh Shammah.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.440]   We learned a moment ago that God is Yahweh El Roy, the God who sees.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.400]   Here, we notice that God is the God who is there.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   His presence is there and His presence fills the city and that is their reward.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.760]   That is their blessing.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.200]   That is their success.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:42.160]   Not simply to overcome those pagans, not simply to overcome my financial distress, not simply
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:49.520]   to overcome my work distress, family distress, God's presence is their portion.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:56.080]   And so I want to encourage you, brothers and sisters in Christ, we know theologically that
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.480]   God's presence is everywhere.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.680]   Right?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:07.160]   God, if you guys are in BCC, you guys learned that today along with a thousand other things.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.040]   God is omnipresent.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.600]   He is always present in all places.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.640]   That means He both rules in that area, arena.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.400]   He sees what's happening.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.280]   He exercises absolute control.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:29.360]   But for this poor Egyptian slave, it means God's grace is with them.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:35.960]   Can I, if any of you are struggling, hurting, seeking out for some strength, for whatever
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.560]   you can find, can these words encourage your heart?
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.240]   God is the God who sees.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.520]   God is the God who is there with you.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.360]   This truth is so profound.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.040]   You know, the reason why I'm preaching this from the book of Genesis is because I've been
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.880]   walking through the book of Genesis with the youth group students now for almost a lap,
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.600]   full year, and I'm still not done with the book of Genesis.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.840]   And the thing about it is I see this theme repeated over and over again.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.200]   And I want to highlight it for you.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.920]   So although this is a bit of a Bible verse look up exercise, please bear with me and
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.240]   let's go to Genesis 26 verse three.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.760]   Genesis 26 verse three.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.600]   In Genesis 26 verse three, this is already a time in which Abraham is almost out of the
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   picture.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.840]   Isaac is young.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.920]   He's leading his family and there is a famine in the land.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.160]   There is desperation simply for basic necessity, food.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:36.080]   And God says this, verse three, sojourn in the land and I will be with you.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.720]   I will bless you for to you and your descendants that will give all these lands.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.600]   I will establish the oath which I swore to your forefather.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.080]   Later on in the same chapter, Isaac runs into another problem, limited resource, lack of
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   food.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   There is also lack of water.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.880]   And so with his neighbors, now there's strife.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.480]   It's like, hey, this well is ours.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.600]   No, this well is ours.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.640]   But if you give up the well, what's going to happen?
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.120]   Your people are going to die of thirst.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   They need the water.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.280]   What are we going to do?
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.800]   This is what God says, verse 24.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.760]   So this is Genesis 26 verse 24.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:12.200]   And the Lord appeared to him that same night and said, I am the God of your father, Abraham.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.400]   Do not fear for I am with you.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:20.360]   I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant, Abraham.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.720]   And then you go from Isaac.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   He gets old.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.400]   His sons grow up.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.320]   Jacob and Esau and Jacob.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.760]   Esau being the older.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.320]   And when Isaac is too old, his eyes get all dim.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.840]   His hearing gets all dim.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.400]   And he's easy to dupe.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.040]   Jacob sees it as an opportunity.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.360]   His mother encouraged him.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.320]   He dupes him and says, I want the blessing.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.880]   Even though I'm not the first child, I want the blessing.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   He dupes his father.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   He dupes his brother.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.000]   And what ends up happening is, just like Abraham, when you, when you go about your own way,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   you make a muck of it.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.240]   And next thing you know, he has to run.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.800]   And it's so sad because although he loved his mother, he doesn't ever see his mother
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   again.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.000]   And he's married and Rebecca doesn't get to see her son.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.560]   And then she dies.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.960]   Jacob can't go back to his father because he's deceived him.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.440]   Jacob now is in threat of his brother.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.520]   Esau said, I am going to kill that man.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   Literally, verbatim.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   I will kill him.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   Right?
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520]   Jacob's life is shot.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.920]   His relationship is all broken.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.560]   What do we do?
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.080]   Take a look at Genesis chapter 28, verse 15 through 16.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.560]   Genesis chapter 28, verse 16 through, I mean 15 through 16.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.240]   What's happening in the story as you turn there is Jacob is walking in the wilderness
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.880]   too, by himself.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.320]   And he's so sad that in the evening he decides to lay down, but there's nothing to lay on.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.520]   So he essentially lies on the side of the road in the dirt and is so dejected.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.480]   He's using a rock for a pillow and he's just sad.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.240]   In that context, verse 15, behold, I am with you.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.880]   I will keep you wherever you go.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.680]   I will bring you back to this land.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:04.120]   Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, surely the Lord is in this place, but I did not know
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.440]   it.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.520]   This is my encouragement to us this morning.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.320]   So many different situations in our lives.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.360]   We can feel pain.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   We can feel dejected.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.480]   We can feel a sense of depression, anxiety, insecurity.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.200]   What is the encouragement?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.360]   Surely God is in this place.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.560]   I just in the moment did not see it.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:34.080]   What's more, later on, Jacob is going to his relatives land because he has to go somewhere.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:41.120]   And if you turn to Genesis chapter 31, in his journey over there, he meets Rachel, girl
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.760]   of his dreams, girl of his dreams.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.720]   Looks like things are looking up, but what ends up happening is Jacob gets duped and
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.920]   then he ends up finding himself married to Rachel's sister who happens to be not so good
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.600]   looking.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   And then what ends up happening is he ends up being swindled to work like three times
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.000]   as much as he was originally supposed to work.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.960]   And next thing you know, not only is he married to both the sisters, but he's entangled with
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.240]   his family.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.720]   And then what ends up happening is Lebon, the father-in-law starts to mistreat Jacob.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.960]   It says that he is no longer on friendly terms.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.640]   He sees that Jacob essentially is a threat.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.120]   And so they start to have animosity.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.640]   What do you do?
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.080]   What do you do?
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:26.120]   Verse one, Genesis chapter 31 verse one, then the Lord said to Jacob, return to the land
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.560]   of your fathers, to the relatives.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.880]   I will be with you.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.960]   I can just keep going just for the sake of time.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.880]   What happens is when Jacob gets old, guess what?
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.120]   His 12 sons grow up.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.600]   His 12 sons, many of them are very vile and wicked.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.560]   They get angry at Joseph, the younger brother, because Joseph is a little proud.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.440]   Joseph is clearly the guy that Jacob loves most.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.840]   He's got his like nice gown, almost like a royal robe.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.960]   So then the brothers say, let's kill the guy.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.400]   Oh no, wait, better yet, let's sell the guy.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.840]   They sell him as a slave to the Egyptians.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.480]   He gets sent on over there.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.560]   What do you do when you're sent as a slave by your own brothers?
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.840]   Do you know what it says?
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.280]   Genesis 39, two, the Lord was with Joseph and the Lord caused him to become a successful
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.320]   man.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.080]   Joseph later on, he's falsely accused.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.760]   He's falsely accused because he's working as a slave now.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.240]   He's been entrusted with a lot of things, but a wicked woman in the home, essentially
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.640]   Potiphar's wife, she's making advances towards him and she says, lie with me.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   He says, no.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.480]   She says, lie with me and grabs on his shirt.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.120]   He says no and he runs away.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.480]   Now she thinks of this as an opportunity to falsely accuse this guy.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.760]   He gets accused and sent to jail.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.520]   Three years he spends in jail.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.240]   Three years.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.120]   What do you do when you're, when you're falsely accused?
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.600]   When you're hurt because people think the worst of you rather than the better?
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.080]   People assume the wrong of you, judge you, make you feel like you're worse than you really
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.200]   are.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   Genesis 29, 31.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:03.640]   I mean, Genesis 29, 21, but the Lord was with Joseph, extended his kindness to Kim,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.600]   gave him favor in the sight of the jailed chief.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.120]   Brothers and sisters, the reason why I went through that exercise of going through the
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.280]   passages is to show you every one of these significant figures in the Bible, Jacob's
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.160]   a significant figure, Joseph's a significant figure.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:27.560]   They experienced a full gamut of life experiences that we would call affliction, pain, hurt.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:34.400]   And the theme of the story is, and their success rested in God's presence.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:39.080]   And their hope and rest, when they're in the anxiety of like, what do we do when something
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.840]   like this happens?
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.840]   How do I get out?
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.120]   How do I get free?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.400]   Their peace and rest comes with God's presence.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.040]   And that is my encouragement to you this morning.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.840]   Can we say along with Jacob, surely the Lord is in this place.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.080]   Will our hearts be encouraged to say, perhaps I did not know it at the time, but God who
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:07.400]   is strong, God who sees, God who knows all things, God who hears, he is with me.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.920]   And that is the encouragement to you.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:17.840]   And as a final way of exhorting, you know, after learning these truths, that God is the
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:23.680]   God, Yahweh El Roy, who hears, I'm sorry, who sees.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:29.240]   And then learning about God, God Yahweh Shema, the God who is there.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.800]   I think just exhortation is, let's remember that.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.200]   Let's acknowledge that.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.800]   Hagar is not gonna forget.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:44.160]   Her son is literally named after the event and the experience of God seeing her in the
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.040]   midst of pain and suffering.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.440]   For us too, in our hearts and our minds, we need to remember the powerful God who is here
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.920]   with us everywhere.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.280]   The merciful God who intervenes, the gracious God who pours out his mercy in the time of
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   need.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.280]   In the time of need.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.120]   But what's more, as we exercise this trust, we realize we get a better picture of God
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.160]   too.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.520]   We exercise this trust and just as God sees us, we see God in a better light.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.240]   It's when we put our trust and faith in him, we understand to a greater degree through
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:29.280]   experiencing him, just how faithful and trustworthy he is.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:35.880]   And that's why, to me it makes sense that we as believers practicing trust, we should
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.680]   be strong.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.540]   We should be courageous.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.460]   We should be persevering in our obedience in the midst of suffering.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.840]   We should be persevering in the midst of difficulties.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.480]   And that is why God could even exhort us and command us in the scriptures to Joshua and
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.380]   say, "Have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:43:01.420]   Do not tremble or dismayed for the Lord your God is with you."
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:09.160]   I hope that when we experience devastation, discouragement, conflict and affliction, those
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.220]   things happen and it's almost a regular pattern for those who are faithful.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:21.580]   But when we not be like those with no hope, with no peace, and over time they're still
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:28.020]   weak, because they're still trying so hard to find strength on their own.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.380]   If we can neglect this truth that God sees and God hears and God is there, what will
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.860]   happen to us is this.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.900]   I mean think about what will happen to us.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.420]   We're going to be in a moment of desperation and whatever comes our way, we're going to
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.140]   latch onto.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.180]   Not only that, we're going to feel a sense of hardness and bitterness.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.980]   If there's other people causing us affliction and pain, we're going to say, "Well, they
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:48.980]   ought to know what they did."
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.860]   We're going to sense a feel of desperation, "I want those people to know what's happening."
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.260]   And there's a sense of expression, explosion, frustration.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.700]   And in the end, all of that is going to ruin us.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:08.420]   But for those of us who understand that God is a God who hears, who sees and who is there,
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:16.260]   we have hope for rest, peace, stability, security in our God who is so powerful.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.260]   Amen.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.260]   I hope that you guys are challenged to be strong and courageous in the presence of God.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.260]   Let's pray.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:30.500]   Father God, we want to thank you so much again.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:40.180]   We thank you God that Lord in the midst of our lives here, that you the God of the universe
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.760]   would care to know.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.060]   And King David would ask, "Who are we that you would be even mindful of us?"
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:51.060]   And that question is right on.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.020]   We are but broken people.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.660]   We are but sinners at times.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.380]   But Lord, you esteem us and God, you give attention to us.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   We thank you so much that we read of the story of Hagar.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.180]   And we are so encouraged that God, although she experienced so much pain, although she
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:11.720]   experienced so much difficulty, Lord, you appeared at the right time in the right way
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.880]   that you encouraged.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.180]   And God, you strengthen through your promise and through your presence.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:22.980]   I pray that for every single one of us in this room, we would leave this place knowing
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.940]   how to deal with difficulty in our lives.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.980]   I also pray that through this week, we would grow a hunger to say, "Father God, sometimes
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.100]   we feel like the answer is more finances.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.240]   We feel like the answer is just better people in our lives, people who will love us.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.300]   Sometimes we think like the answer is just this change the environment scenario."
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.620]   But help us to have a true hunger for your presence.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.380]   Knowing God, that the answer lies in you.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.380]   We thank you so much, Lord, it's in Christ's name.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.380]   Amen.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.660]   Why don't we take a break?
