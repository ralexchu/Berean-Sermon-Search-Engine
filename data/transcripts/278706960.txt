[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   We are going to be looking a lot at 24 and 25, so it's better if you actually have your
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.040]   Bibles open.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   It is going to be up here, and so I'll give you guys a little bit of time to find it.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.560]   And we're going to be reading from verses 13 to 30.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   "Watch, therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour, for it will be like a man
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480]   going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.400]   To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.760]   ability, and then he went away.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.440]   He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he had five
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.020]   talents more.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.080]   So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.120]   But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120]   money.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.800]   And after a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.160]   And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing the five talents more, saying,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.440]   'Master, you delivered to me these five talents here, I have made five talents more.'
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.120]   His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.480]   You have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.860]   Enter into the joy of your master.'
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.840]   And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.440]   talents here, I have made two talents more.'
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.880]   His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.800]   You have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.860]   Enter into the joy of your master.'
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.280]   He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.720]   a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.600]   So I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.720]   Here you have what is yours.'
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.400]   I have not sown and gather where I scatter no seed.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.240]   Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.680]   received what was my own with interest.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.760]   So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.480]   For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.200]   But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.240]   And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness, in that place where there will be
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.360]   weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.520]   Let's pray together.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.960]   Father, we pray that you would help us to engage this morning in worship through your
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   word.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.640]   I pray that you would help us to apply what you would seek for us to hear and to change.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.320]   And I pray that you would help us to leave this place loving Christ more, thanking Christ
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.640]   more, and resembling a little bit more of Jesus.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.480]   So we thank you for just the freedom to come and worship you.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.920]   We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.600]   If you remember, in December of last year, a theologian named R.C.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.880]   Sproul, he's very famous, he passed away.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.240]   And the next morning, my Facebook feeds were like, "Well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.440]   Well done, good and faithful servant," in regard to this man.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.520]   And a few months later, Billy Graham passed away in February.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.400]   Do you guys remember that day?
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.600]   And just on everyone, a lot of people's feeds, you also had this, "Well done, good and faithful
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   servant."
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.880]   And you often see this when a really well-known or faithful man or woman of God passes away.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.280]   But is this commendation only for a Billy Graham or a R.C.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.560]   Sproul?
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.240]   Is this something you and I will hear when we die?
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.080]   How about that murderer who accepts Jesus on his deathbed?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.880]   Will he hear this?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.920]   A drug addict who has found Christ?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.120]   A former womanizer who has now been redeemed by the blood of Christ, will he hear this?
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.920]   Someone who struggles all her life with doubt and depression, will she hear this?
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.880]   Death comes to every single one of us in this room.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.400]   So when it comes, don't be surprised.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.880]   But when you pass and when you stand before the judgment seat of Christ, will you hear,
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.800]   "Well done, my good and faithful servant," can or will this be said of you?
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.840]   And this often quoted part of Scripture is something that I would like for us to kind
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.800]   of examine today.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.960]   But in order to do this, we're going to have to actually look at all of Matthew 24 and
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   25.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.100]   We're not going to read every single line, but there is a broader context.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.520]   And if you miss the broader context, you miss the point of this parable and you end up misapplying
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   it.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.560]   So I would like to just point our attention to Matthew 24 and 25.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.360]   If you think of it as just one sermon with points, then it's easier to track along.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.280]   Matthew 21 to 28, those eight chapters take up about 30% of Matthew's account of the gospel.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.040]   And about that whole section takes place in one week of Jesus' week before his crucifixion.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.420]   And 24 and 25 just fall right in the middle.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.200]   And this one long parable, which reads like a sermon.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.420]   And so we're going to look at this, and then we're going to be actually looking into the
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.780]   parable of the talents.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.300]   So the focus of all of chapters 24 and 25 is on the end times, the spread of the gospel
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.220]   of the kingdom, and how the elect will respond to the preaching of this gospel.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.340]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.260]   All of chapters 24 and 25, the focus is on the preaching of the gospel in the end times
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.620]   and how the elect will respond to this preaching.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.820]   So if you look at it as one long parable with different parts, it's easier to track along.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.860]   Now this entire section with the very well-known parables contained within are descriptive,
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   and they're not prescriptive.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.540]   And what does that mean?
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.220]   They are describing the things that will take place.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.020]   They are not prescribing what you and I need to do to hear well done.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.060]   Are you guys following me?
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.660]   It's a description of what's going to happen, of how kingdom citizens will be living in
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.500]   light of the gospel, and not prescribing how to become a kingdom citizen.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.540]   Because the how to become a kingdom citizen has been done for the previous 20 chapters.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.060]   So this whole section is descriptive and not prescriptive.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.060]   And the only real application in both of these two chapters is this.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.380]   Be watchful, be awake, be prepared, keep on watching, be alert, be sober, watch, pay attention,
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.320]   pay close attention, be alert, watch.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.000]   And that's the main application for this section.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.880]   So there is no do this and this and this, and you will hear well done.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.460]   So I want to kind of get that out of the way.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.320]   Chapter 25 is broken up into three points, or three parables, describing how people will
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.080]   be living in the end.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.560]   Verses 1 through 13 we know as a parable of the 10 virgins.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.520]   And the point of that really is kingdom people will lead prepared lives.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.680]   And then you get to the parable of the talents, but if you look at verse 13, it's actually
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.400]   the last verse of the parable of the 10 virgins, and the first verse of the parable of the
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   talents.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.160]   So there is a connection there and they're all intertwined.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   And the parable of the talents, the main point is this, prepared lives do not all look the
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   same.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.840]   Okay, prepared lives do not all look the same.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.200]   And then verses 31 to 46, you have the parables of the goats and the sheep, the right and
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.800]   the left, and the point of that is prepared people inherit eternal life, unprepared people
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.400]   inherit internal punishment.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.800]   So again, the question that we want to reflect on this morning is, will you hear well done,
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.560]   good and faithful servant?
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.920]   And we're going to spend the bulk of our time today thinking about this question.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.280]   And I want to take us into a little deeper look at the parable of talents, and I'm going
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.960]   to be focusing on three questions, okay?
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.720]   The first one is, who does a master represent?
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.560]   In the parable of the talents, who does a master represent?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.060]   The second, who do the servants represent?
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.240]   And the third, what is a talent?
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:33.040]   Okay, who do the masters represent, who do the servants represent, and what is a talent?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.360]   So I want to read Matthew 24 verse 14.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.960]   It's "Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.400]   nations and then the end will come."
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.960]   So who does a master represent in this parable?
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.920]   Can you click it?
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.280]   The true Christ who will return in power, the son of man who was promised in the Old
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.320]   Testament, the coming Messiah who will fulfill all of God's promises, the bridegroom, the
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.780]   master of the house, the glorious king, they're all one and the same.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.920]   So the son of man, the true Christ, the returning warrior king, he is the main character of
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.600]   this whole section, and he is the main character in the parable of the talents.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.000]   So in the parable of the talents, this conquering king will be returning at an hour unknown
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.400]   to us to settle debts and to gather what is rightfully his.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.040]   So can we have a click?
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.800]   So it says, "Watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour, for it will
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.920]   be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted to them his property."
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   If you read the scriptures cover to cover, Genesis to Revelation, there are a few conclusions
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.880]   you can draw about God.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.960]   And if you actually do your scripture homework, you cannot land on any other conclusions,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   okay?
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   And these are some of the conclusions.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.240]   The first one is God's will is perfect.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   Amen?
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.560]   God's will is perfect.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.520]   The second conclusion is God makes no mistakes.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.600]   Third, he wastes nothing.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.080]   Fourth, he is perfectly good and he is perfectly loving.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.680]   So those four conclusions, among many, you cannot miss.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   First one, God's will is perfect, he makes no mistakes, he wastes nothing, and he is
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.960]   perfectly good and perfectly loving.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.920]   And I'm going to point you to just a few sample scripture verses that help us to come to these
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   conclusions.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.760]   "Do not be conformed to this world in the will of God, which is good and acceptable
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.080]   and perfect."
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   Proverbs 16, "For the Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   of trouble."
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.640]   "I know that you can do all things and no purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.720]   "And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good through
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.920]   those who are called according to his purpose."
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.560]   God's will is perfect.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.300]   He makes no mistakes.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.640]   He wastes nothing and he is perfectly good.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.040]   Now for you guys who have grown up in the church, you've heard these things before.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.640]   And as I read these truths, there is no theological tension in your minds.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.920]   There is no like, wait, I can't say amen to that, in your heads.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.040]   But when you hear these things, I believe that in every single one of us, there is a
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:30.080]   little bit of an emotional response, a little bit of an emotional tension.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.200]   Has God really not made any mistakes?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.960]   Is he perfectly good?
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   Is his will truly perfect?
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Because you know what this means.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.820]   If God's will is perfect, he makes no mistakes, he wastes nothing, he's perfectly good.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:53.200]   If that is true, that means God has not made a single mistake in your life and has ordained
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.160]   every detail of your life in his perfectly good and perfectly loving plan.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.440]   When I hear this, there is tension in my heart.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.720]   God has not made a single mistake in your life and has ordained every detail of your
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.200]   life in his perfectly good and perfectly loving plan.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.960]   So you may not be custom to expressing these voices, expressing these tensions, so let
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   me help you, okay?
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:29.160]   If God's will is so perfect, why is there so much imperfection, pain, and suffering?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.060]   If God has not made a single mistake in my life, then does that mean he deliberately
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.920]   ordained or allowed me to blank?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:49.320]   On purpose, does that mean he caused the death of my friend?
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:58.560]   On purpose, did he allow for my beloved young child to get a disease?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.200]   There's something in us that cries out, "Either God, your will is not perfect, or you're not
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   all that good."
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.600]   Naturally, you and I can grasp the idea of an all-powerful God, okay?
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.880]   And this all-powerful God actually is a scary, like we get scared.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.840]   Like if there's a being out there, he's all-powerful, it's a scary prospect, right?
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:27.480]   So we don't have a problem necessarily understanding all power, but the things that we see day
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:33.520]   to day actually make us doubt his goodness.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.680]   And there's tension in our hearts, and that's okay.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.560]   So you can theologically agree with all of these conclusions and still have an emotional
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:47.360]   objection to these truths, especially when things in our lives actually start to unravel.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.320]   And that tension actually is what causes so many people to reject the God of the Scripture.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:01.840]   So do not discount the realness of the tension that resides in our hearts.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.000]   God's Word teaches us that the master in this parable, his will is perfect, he makes no
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.520]   mistakes, he wastes nothing, he is perfectly good and perfectly loving, okay?
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.160]   So I'm gonna get that out of the way.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.800]   And this God is the main character of all of Matthew 24 and 25.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   It's not the servants.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.320]   But we're gonna get to the servants, okay?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.600]   So who do the servants represent?
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.980]   The servants in this parable represent humanity in light of the preached gospel of the kingdom.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.440]   Humanity in light of the preached gospel of the kingdom.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.160]   Matthew 24, 14, I had that earlier up there for you.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.880]   "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.080]   nations and then the end will come."
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.440]   And I wanna introduce you to two individuals who have had the gospel of Christ preached
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.200]   to them.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:52.760]   Two individuals like you and me who have been entrusted with a number of talents, okay?
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.080]   So this is Milka.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   And I met Milka June of 2015 in Mwanza, Tanzania.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.880]   She was born with the albino gene.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.680]   And all over, and you guys know what albinism is, okay?
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.200]   All over the world, one in every 21,000 people have albinism.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.640]   They're born with this gene.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.680]   But strangely enough, in Tanzania, it's one in 1,400.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.640]   So there are a lot of albinos in Tanzania.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.900]   And this is a problem because Tanzanians are very superstitious.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:35.440]   So in Tanzania, if you carry an albino's gene, or an albino's bones with you, the superstition
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.160]   goes, "You will have good luck, evil will be warded off, and you will be prosperous."
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:47.360]   That's the superstition of someone who lives in Tanzania when you deal with someone with
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.120]   albinism.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.280]   And can we have the next slide?
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:57.000]   Sadly, many children born with albinism in Tanzania are kidnapped.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.200]   Their hands and feet are cut off, and they're left to die.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.240]   Next slide.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:11.760]   Even more sadly, many of these kidnappings are permitted by mom and dad.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:20.040]   Mom and dad receive money, they turn a blind eye when their child is kidnapped, the child's
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:28.280]   hands and feet are cut off, and the child and the parents are forever damaged.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   And why do they do this?
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.520]   Because they're poor.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.400]   If you look up Tanzania albino on the internet, you're going to see pictures that are much
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.040]   more gruesome, and that'll pain your heart, and you can read about it if there's an interest.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.400]   How many talents did my friend Milka receive from the Lord?
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.920]   I'm going to introduce you to another friend of mine.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.720]   That's not the friend, that's just the director of the church.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.420]   So last year in August, about 10 months ago, I was in Sri Lanka.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.000]   And this area was very remote.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.520]   It's a part of Sri Lanka that's called Batikaloa, and I took a 10-hour car ride, all local,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.280]   through nothing but nothing, and I ended up on the other side of the country.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.880]   And how rural was it?
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.480]   The center that we went to, they showed me a building, and it used to be a kitchen.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.120]   And I was like, what happened to this kitchen?
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.660]   She said, oh, an elephant just backed into it and knocked the whole building down.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.660]   That rural.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.780]   I was like, just imagining in my head, because I'm having to take care of some paperwork
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.580]   for this, I was like, this elephant with a big booty just went, bop, and then the thing
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.820]   fell down.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.820]   That's how rural it was.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.540]   Wild elephants roaming the territory.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.820]   Next slide.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.800]   This area was in civil war until 2009.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   And next slide.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.240]   I visited the home of a 12-year-old boy.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   His name is Sajanthan.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   He's on the left.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.180]   Sajanthan is 12.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.360]   Dad is 28.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.360]   Mom is 26.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.660]   And in your head, you're doing some math right now, right?
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.980]   Mom and dad did not finish primary school.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.260]   Because when they were children, war broke out.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:19.380]   They were both taken from their families and forced into becoming child soldiers.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.300]   Mom and dad have both killed with their hands.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:30.760]   Mom and dad have both seen loved ones murdered.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.680]   And they've both known the horrors of war.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.240]   At the end of these home visits, I pray with the families.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.000]   And this family's prayer request, their first, I mean, it's going through an interpreter.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So they said, safety for the children.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And I said, okay.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   What do you mean?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.560]   And he said, snakes and scorpions come in here all the time.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.820]   I was like, okay, paradigm shift.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:59.800]   Safety for children, for them, meant keeping these scorpions and snakes out of the house.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.400]   Different world.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.720]   How many talents do you think Sajanthan was entrusted with?
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.520]   How many talents were his mom and dad entrusted with?
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.040]   Will they hear, well done?
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.360]   Good and faithful servant.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Now in this parable, the number is not significant.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   But here in this parable, we have a servant who has received five talents and a servant
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.260]   who has received two.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.840]   And they both receive the exact same reward or commendation.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.720]   Can I have the next slide?
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.300]   Okay.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.040]   How about you guys on this side read verse 21, you guys on this side read verse 23.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   Ready, go.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   Okay.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:48.480]   That was so without energy, but all right.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.960]   We'll do whatever.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.120]   Verse 21 and 23 are 100% the same.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.600]   And I believe with all my heart that if the one talent guy had faithfully invested a single
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.580]   talent, he too would have received the same commendation.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.080]   But he doesn't.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.840]   And this is what's interesting.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.240]   This is a parable.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.520]   And normally in a parable, you're not supposed to scrutinize every detail because there's
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.880]   usually just one point in the parable.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   But this one talent guy is so significant that I actually thought a lot about him.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:26.320]   We do not know why he buried his talent, but we know that he did.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.600]   But when these kinds of questions come into our heads, we can let scripture inform scripture
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.300]   and use our sanctified imagination.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.800]   And as I thought through what could this guy possibly be thinking to bury his one talent,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.600]   I came up with three conclusions.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.520]   And these are all my opinions.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.760]   It's not solid gold, word of God, but just follow with me.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.120]   The first reason, perhaps, he thought he had a lot of time and he was caught unaware.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.760]   This is a running theme of both chapters 24 and 25.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.320]   He may have thought the master's return is still a long ways away.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   So I have time.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.360]   I'll invest later.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.400]   I'll invest when I'm older.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.760]   When it's more convenient for me, I will invest my talent.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.240]   And so when he's caught unaware when the master returns, he just says, "Hey, I know you're
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.560]   a jerk.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.560]   So I hid it.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.120]   I'm sorry."
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.920]   Possible first reason.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.640]   Second reason, maybe he was jealous of the other two.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.560]   This man gets five.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.960]   This man gets two.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.700]   What is this?
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.800]   So he's probably thinking, "I'm not very happy with the talent cards that I've just been
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   dealt."
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:46.600]   And in spite, in bitterness, maybe he buried his talent because he was unhappy with the
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.840]   master's perception of him.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.420]   Third possible reason, he had a distorted misconception of the master that was not really
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.340]   based on truth.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.620]   He says in verse 24, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.360]   and gathering where you scattered no seed."
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.960]   So he says his master is scleros, hard, like a unyielding, like un...
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.360]   What do you call it?
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.280]   Just bitter, violent, fierce.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   So he basically says, "Master, it's because you are a very hard man to please.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.720]   So I hid my talent.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.560]   You are unfair, you are unreasonable, your demands are too great, you are too selfish,
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.280]   and I will not be used for your purposes."
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.680]   So he may have had a distorted understanding of the master.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.000]   But regardless of the reason, he buries his talent.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.760]   And remember, Matthew 24 through 25 is descriptive, not prescriptive.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.440]   The application is not, "Therefore, do not bury your talent."
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.000]   The application is not, "Hey, invest all your talent, let's pray to the kingdom of God."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.120]   It's not that at all.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.600]   The application is, "Your master's coming to collect.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.840]   Be ready."
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.160]   So the whole point of this is good stewardship versus bad stewardship.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.400]   It's not about the number.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.920]   It's about the response.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.080]   So if the difference between hearing, "Well done," and "Cast this wicked servant into
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.160]   the outer darkness," is in how we steward our talents, I'm going to ask a very important
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.320]   question.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.040]   What is a talent?
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.560]   And this is a question I've mulled on and mulled over the last 15 years.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.880]   What in the world, then, is a talent?
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.200]   If there is a correlation between our talent investing and our eternal destination, this
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.920]   is a very, very important question that you and I have to actually think through and come
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   to a conclusion.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   Yeah?
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   It's a very important question.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.780]   First of all, the Greek word, "talanta," it just means a large sum of money.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:04.440]   And when you and I hear the word "talent," we often think of it as a positive thing.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.400]   So it's like, "Oh, he has a lot of talents."
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.920]   You're not thinking that he has a lot of vices.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.480]   You're thinking he has a lot of things that he can use, right?
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.160]   But the word "talent" is actually a very neutral word.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.440]   There is no good talent.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.280]   There is no bad talent.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.960]   A talent in and of itself is neutral, okay?
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.880]   Here, let me illustrate.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.040]   Is there such a thing as a bad dollar?
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   Can I have an image?
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   Can I have a slide?
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.880]   Take a look at both of these pictures.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:41.120]   Which would you rather have?
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.500]   What if that one on the left you found in a sewer?
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.240]   Would you still rather have it?
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.240]   There is no bad dollar, okay?
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.480]   So if I were to offer you a $100 bill that smells like armpit and said, "You can either
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:08.640]   have this one or this freshly minted $1 bill that smells like glory," which would you choose?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:17.040]   Unless you're weird, every single person here would choose the one on the left, the $100
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:25.880]   bill, because the outer thing does not have a value in and of itself.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.360]   You guys following me?
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.880]   A talent is neutral.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.800]   What is, then, truly a biblical talent?
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.720]   Can I have the next slide?
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   Just one click.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.280]   Don't go too fast.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.240]   Obviously, our abilities, skills, and natural talents are included.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.000]   Our money, our resources, our time, they're all included.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.520]   Next one.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.480]   Our privileges and our opportunities are also talents.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.100]   Did you guys know that only 6% of all the world has a college degree?
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.680]   You are probably sitting next to somebody who has a college degree.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.800]   So say to that person, "You are the best of the best.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   You are elite."
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.120]   Oh, some of you guys actually are doing it.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.800]   Thank you.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.440]   6% of the world.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.160]   40% of the world eats only once a day.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.140]   If you eat more than that, you have a privilege.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:36.820]   If you can make $45,000 per year per person in your home, you are top 1% of the world.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.800]   Have you ever flown on a plane?
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.760]   Because most of the world dreams to get on a plane once.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.240]   There are so many things that we've been allotted, and so opportunities and privileges are also
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   talents.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   Next one.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.360]   Your unique characteristics that make you you.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.320]   A personality is you.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.720]   Is personality good or bad?
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   Is neutral.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.640]   There is no bad personality.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   I'm loud.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.360]   My wife is quiet.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.400]   It doesn't mean I'm bad and she's good or I'm good and she's bad.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   What makes a personality tainted and damaged is the sin that's there behind it.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.200]   A personality trait of being shy or outgoing or introverted or extroverted, those things
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.920]   are all neutral.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.800]   But God has uniquely created every single person in this room, every detail of his or
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.240]   her life uniquely.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   And that has been God-ordained.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   God's will is perfect.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.600]   He makes no mistakes.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.020]   Next one.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:40.040]   Every single relationship that God has ordained in your life is also a talent.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.800]   Because a lot of times we are either shaped and encouraged and built up by relationships
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.840]   or we have been traumatized and scarred and permanently damaged by our relationship.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.360]   But all those things too God has ordained.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.060]   Next one.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:01.440]   All of our mistakes, regrets, and failures, weaknesses, talents.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.600]   Next one.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.060]   Scars and traumas.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.320]   Next one.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.040]   Passions and interests.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.860]   So what is a talent?
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.980]   Every single detail of your life that has been ordained by God for you to invest for
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.760]   his glory and to the building up of his kingdom in the light of the return of Christ, that's
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   a talent.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.080]   I'll say it again and less fast so you guys can...
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:35.000]   A talent is every single detail of your life that has been ordained by God for you to invest
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.180]   for his glory and to the building up of his kingdom in light of the return of the king.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.240]   That is a talent.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.720]   And I'll share with you some of my talents.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.700]   I sing well, objectively.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.500]   I've sung at 25 weddings and a bunch of Berean ones.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.500]   Okay?
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.340]   I'll throw that out there.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   I'm good with languages.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.540]   I pick up languages pretty fast.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.900]   None of you are blessed by these things.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   Sounds like a boast, right?
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   Yeah, but that's objective.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   Okay?
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   Privileges.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.180]   I have been on an average of 55 flights a year the last six years.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:19.280]   I've seen more hidden places in the corners of this world than most all of you.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.820]   I've seen more of North Korea than South Korea.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.540]   These are privileges.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.540]   Unique things.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.100]   I'm a father to twins, which is becoming less and less unique, but I have twins.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.100]   Okay?
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.340]   I am 40 years old and I still have a baby tooth.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.220]   That has nothing to do with anything helpful to the kingdom of God, but that's unique.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.780]   God ordained it.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.260]   So the dentist actually said, "If you get into a fight, get punched in your left side
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.260]   of your face, because if you get punched in the right side of your face, that's like a
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.220]   $3,000 surgery," because the tooth is growing sideways, the adult tooth, so it never pushed
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.340]   it out.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.380]   So if you and I ever get into a fight, hit me here, please.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.380]   All right?
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.300]   But that is something that is unique to me.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.780]   I don't know my biological mother.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.220]   My father divorced three times, twice before I was five.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.740]   I went to 12 elementary schools and I've seen my father handcuffed and taken away to jail
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.780]   three times.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:19.300]   I've been badly beaten and abused, and I used to pray out of bitterness, "God, if you are
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:25.900]   real, I will never call you father because you've given me such a horrible, earthly one."
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.420]   And when we used to sing, "God is so good," in the back with the kids, I used to sing,
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:39.340]   "God is a peep," under my breath, because I hated this God who gave me such a bad life.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.300]   I am a pastor at Berean.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.580]   I still live alongside of Pastor Peter, Mark, and Nathan.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.700]   I'm a passionate advocate of orphans.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.220]   I am passionate about the poor.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:00.580]   I am passionate about the Word of God, because that alone has healed me and transformed me.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:10.620]   I am passionate about kids who grow up in broken homes.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:16.860]   Those details that God has ordained in my life were all on purpose.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.020]   Hallelujah.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.660]   And I want to talk about, briefly, scars and traumas, passions and interests, because they
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.580]   are intertwined.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.900]   You know what is interesting is brokenness, healing, and scars.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:35.180]   You know, even if you're fully healed, that wound, if you got a wound, it remains sensitive.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:42.220]   So when someone pushes it, it hurts, even if it is healed.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:47.740]   But the funny thing is, when God redeems and heals a scar, He turns it into a weapon.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.780]   That's what I've seen.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.020]   So as many of you guys know, we were China's, Berean's missionaries to China for three years,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.140]   and honestly, to this day, I still don't like China all that much.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.300]   We're there, we're supposed to be there the rest of our lives.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.980]   It's just a difficult place.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.900]   But I was there.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.500]   I was in North Korea, and the second time I was in there, in Pyongyang, I was like,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.940]   "God, what am I doing here?
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.100]   Is there a special plan for the North Koreans that you have for me to do, to minister to
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.100]   them?"
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.100]   Nothing.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.140]   My heart was not moved.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.820]   That's okay.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.380]   I have a vested interest in them, but it's not my passion.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.180]   Some people, you say, "North," and then they cry.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.780]   But that's not me.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:38.700]   But when I have traveled in the world and I've seen a broken child, orphans, when I
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:48.060]   go visit a home and I hear that that kid has been abused, child is, dad's in jail, there
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.780]   is rage.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:56.620]   And that rage causes me to action.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.660]   And there's a point of, it's not just like, "Oh, I feel so bad for you."
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:07.100]   There's a point of holy compassion that I have with that kid because of those talents
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.060]   that God has given me.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:15.480]   And when I speak into that kid's life, there is glimmers of joy.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.580]   Because when God heals, He redeems, He turns all of those things into weapons.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.660]   And you know what is interesting is as I'm getting older, this is my 18th year of ministry,
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:31.660]   I'm realizing my failures and my weaknesses are doing more for kingdom building than my
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.500]   strengths.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.560]   None of you were edified at all when I said, "I think good."
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.720]   Not one of you.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.200]   I have a good memory.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.520]   I have memorized a lot of God's word.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.800]   But that doesn't bless you.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.220]   You have a desire to judge me.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:59.120]   When I say that this is what God has given me to bless the church, you are often not
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.280]   blessed.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:07.220]   But what you are often blessed by is the vulnerability, the weakness, the humility, the failures in
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.240]   my life.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.040]   And that's something that I've, it's just such an interesting thing.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:19.560]   Not my sin, I'm not saying sin, but the weaknesses that I'm fighting to protect every day, that
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:30.120]   struggle, that process serves as an encouragement more than my victories I've discovered.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.280]   God is more magnified in my failures than in my victories.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.240]   And every single one of you here has a talent or many.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:45.120]   But some of you like the one talent guy because, "Oh, the Lord is not hastening in his return.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.960]   I have a lot of time."
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.640]   Maybe burying your talent.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.120]   Some who are like, "Okay, that person got dealt these hands, this hand of cards, that
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.560]   person got dealt this.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.800]   Why did I end up with this life?
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.480]   God, it's all your fault."
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.960]   Bury the talent.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.780]   Some people because, not because they read the word of God, but because they've seen
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.640]   so many hypocrites of church are scarred and damaged by the church that they have a misconception
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.100]   of who God really is.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:19.600]   And a lot of times they respond by burying their talent.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.160]   They blame God for their past.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.640]   And you know one thing about the past, if you can't move on from the past, that might
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.300]   be an indicator that maybe there has not been real change in your heart.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:36.700]   Because when God comes and transforms your life, he smashes the areas of your heart where
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.260]   you're naturally led to forgive and to love.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:46.180]   I want to share a few verses with you.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.980]   So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.780]   What does that mean?
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.500]   In your relationships, give glory to God.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.580]   In your studies, give glory to God.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.160]   In your work, give glory to God.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.020]   In your marriage, give glory to God.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.660]   In your failures, give glory to God.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.260]   In your disease, give glory to God.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.140]   In your barrenness, give glory to God.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.660]   In your singleness, give glory to God.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.740]   In your past, give glory to God.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:18.820]   Are you grieving because of what God has put in front of you right now?
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.820]   Give glory to God.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.820]   Are you rich?
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.820]   Give glory to God.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.820]   Are you poor?
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.180]   Give glory to God.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.500]   Do you have weaknesses?
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.260]   Proclaim like Paul, "I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that the
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.100]   power of Christ might rest on me."
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.400]   And know that you are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.940]   For neither death nor life nor angels or rulers or present or things to come nor powers can
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.300]   separate you from the love of God.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:55.740]   I remember, as you remember, I shared with you that Matthew 24 and 25 is just one sermon.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.820]   It's one long parable.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.860]   You have to read it all together to correctly understand the context.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:10.380]   The parable of the talents, the charge is not to talent investing.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:17.140]   Here are the main exhortations of Matthew 24, 25.
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.420]   Do not be misled.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.580]   Do not be deceived.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.900]   Recognize that he is near and at the door.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   Be alert.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.580]   Be ready.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:35.940]   Be ready and on the alert.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:45.860]   Those who are ready and alert will be those who day in and day out just seek to give glory
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.180]   to God.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:57.620]   Those who are ready and alert will be those who day in and day out are seeking to give
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.940]   glory to God.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.460]   Our main application is to be alert and awake and to find ourselves on the correct side
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.140]   of the gospel call.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.020]   The unprepared virgins, the one talent servant, the goats on the left who have failed in every
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.300]   encounter with God, what do they have in common?
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.900]   Can I have the next slide?
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.380]   So for I was hungry you gave me food.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.580]   I was thirsty and you gave me drink.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.780]   I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.500]   I was naked and you clothed me.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.700]   I was sick and you visited me.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.180]   I was in prison and you came to me.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.900]   Then the righteous will answer him and say, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.820]   you or thirsty and give you drink?
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.140]   When did we see you a stranger and welcome you or naked and clothe you?
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.940]   And then when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.260]   And that's the response of the righteous.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.860]   But at the same time, the response of the wicked is this.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.980]   Then they also will answer saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.900]   or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.420]   What do these guys all have in common?
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:04.660]   They don't know when it is that they're meeting Christ.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:10.140]   They're not aware that that little encounter appointed and ordained by the Lord was an
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.340]   opportunity for worship.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:18.980]   So the call for you and me is not so much to do, to build, to expand.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:25.900]   The call for you and me is just to be sober and alert to examining the realness of the
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.540]   fruit that is in our lives.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:37.780]   First Timothy 4.16, watch your life and your doctrine closely, persevere in them.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.220]   And in so doing, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.860]   So the call to the parable of the talents, which is descriptive, not prescriptive, is
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.460]   for you just to pay attention.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:55.520]   Because there is going to be a response to the gospel.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.180]   So serving God is not something that we try harder at.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:07.380]   Serving God and building his kingdom is a powerful byproduct of a changed life that
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.140]   can only come through a changed heart.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.940]   You follow me?
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:20.740]   Real talent investing can only be done through a changed heart.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:26.960]   And the changed heart only comes through the powerful transforming work of the gospel.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.860]   Everything else is just religion.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:35.420]   But what can change your heart is the word of God, which is living, inactive, and sharper
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.460]   than any double-edged sword.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.460]   Amen?
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:43.140]   Now, our application should not be, "Okay, how am I going to invest my ability to sing
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.700]   to the glory of God to building his kingdom?
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.700]   How am I going to invest the thousand dollars extra that I have to building the kingdom
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.700]   of God?"
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.240]   Those are secondary issues.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:41:00.980]   The primary application is, "Am I responding to the truth of the gospel of Christ?"
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:05.060]   Because whether you know it or not, over time, you will look back in your life and you will
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:09.460]   see so much fruit.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:15.780]   The charge in the parable of the talents is not to invest your talents or to plan to invest
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   your talents.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:22.300]   And sometimes when I hear this sermon, I get a little bit like, "Mm, eh," because then
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   it's like, "Did you read chapter 24?
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:31.260]   Did you read chapter 25, verses 1 through 13, and then 31 to 46?"
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.380]   The parable of the talents is a description.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.820]   So going back to my first question that I threw at everybody, "Will you hear," well
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:52.900]   done, good and faithful servant, "If you are a child of God, yes.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:42:05.460]   If you, from the depths of your heart, have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord,
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:13.100]   you will hear, enter into the joy of your Master."
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:19.220]   The means of this entrance is a simple acceptance of Christ.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:25.420]   And when you accept Christ as Savior, He takes His place in your life as Lord and He starts
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.340]   to mess you up in a holy way.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:35.260]   And the gospel of Jesus Christ changes and redeems and charges every talent.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.020]   So it's like, I see a talent as like a power, like a fireball.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.620]   It's a whoosh, whoosh.
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.980]   Use your talents for the glory of God.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.700]   And that's not the application, okay?
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:52.100]   For you guys who have been saved through the blood of Christ, always do your best to remember
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.020]   that His will is perfect.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.220]   He makes no mistakes.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.420]   He wastes nothing.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:02.120]   And He is perfectly good and loving because the tests and the trials will come.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:08.220]   And in those tests and trials, give glory to God.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.140]   Don't look forward to the next step of your life.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:16.300]   Give glory to God here and now because that will naturally lead you to give glory to God
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.420]   in the next stage.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:26.820]   Where you're at, it says in 1 Corinthians, prosper, give glory to God, bear fruit where
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.080]   you're at.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:34.980]   And in His time, He will give you more.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:40.380]   More tools, more opportunities, more talents to give Him glory.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:47.300]   My hope is that every single one of us works hard, not at building His kingdom, but works
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:55.700]   hard at constantly trying to disentangle ourselves from this world to focus on the saving power
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.100]   and the sweetness of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, because everything else will
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.940]   fall into place if we remember how good He is.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.260]   Amen?
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.260]   Let us pray.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:17.420]   Thank you, Father, for calling us to be your own.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:26.520]   Thank you for saving us, not because of our worthiness, but because we needed saving.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:32.840]   And as those who are saved, I pray that you would help us to be free, to be thankful,
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:42.380]   to be joy-filled, and in our thankfulness and in our joy and in our peace, would you
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.060]   give glory to yourself and bear much fruit.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.740]   For these things we ask in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:49.560]   Thank you.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.400]   - Bye.
