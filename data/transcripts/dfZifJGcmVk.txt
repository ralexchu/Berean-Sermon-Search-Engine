[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   - Good morning Church family, happy Lord's Day.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   The Bible says in Psalm 139 verses 23 and 24,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   "Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   "Try me and know my anxious thoughts,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   "and see if there be any hurtful way in me,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   "and lead me in the everlasting way."
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   It is a challenging prayer to ask God to reveal in us
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   any sins that we need to repent of,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   and anything hindering our worship to him
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   that we need to let go.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   May this be our true desire to make Christ
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   the Lord of every aspect of our lives,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   and that we would find in him
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   our greatest treasure and reward.

[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   - Good morning.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.760]   Welcome to Green Community Church.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.360]   We have quite a few announcements to go over.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.720]   But I wanna just kinda give you an encouragement.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.460]   Because of the number of announcements
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.500]   that are being shared, it's kinda added every week,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.560]   there's no way that we're gonna be able to cover.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.200]   So I'm just, again, going forward,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.820]   we're just gonna be highlighting certain things,
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.940]   but if you really want to know more
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.660]   about what's going on in the church,
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.660]   please check your app, go on Facebook,
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.720]   and there is an email that goes out weekly
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.240]   and give you much more details
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.960]   about what's going on in church.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.160]   So please refer to that.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.520]   But if you become dependent on knowing
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.100]   what's going on at church through Sunday,
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.860]   we're not gonna be able to cover all of these things.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.080]   So I'm just gonna give you a heads up
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.060]   to just go and check the email and check the websites
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.380]   to find out more about what's going on.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.900]   First of all, as I mentioned last week,
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.940]   our family parking, again, family with small children
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.020]   to park on the Kimco side so that you don't have
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.300]   to cross the street.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.400]   And so for the rest of us, you guys can park
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.780]   across the street at Lyon and all the other places.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.140]   And especially those of you who've been parking far away
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.240]   and riding the shuttle, we appreciate you
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.640]   because that has opened up more parking for other people.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.260]   So we encourage you to continue to do that.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.060]   But again, if you guys can help us
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.980]   so that young families with children or strollers,
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.340]   that they don't have to cross the street.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.900]   So if they park there and here,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.660]   it'll be reserved for them, okay?
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.700]   Sprouts PTA, if you have children from K through sixth grade
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.400]   there is a meeting that's happening at 2 p.m.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.520]   So you can go grab your lunch and come back.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.340]   And there's going to be information,
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.360]   any kind of questions that you may have
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.220]   for the new coming year, that meeting is for that, okay?
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.580]   Also for Jubilee, if you are 50 and over,
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.580]   there is a fellowship going on on September 17th at 1245.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.460]   So please contact Elder Phillip
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.220]   and there should be a sign up.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.420]   And again, is that next Sunday?
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.000]   Yeah, next Sunday there'll be fellowship at 1245.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.300]   Family Ministry Picnic happening September 24th,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   11 through 3 p.m.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.420]   If you want to participate, get to know other families,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.260]   sign up for that.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.120]   And then FAM 245 Workshop, that's for families,
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.400]   young couples, maybe you might not be that young,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.760]   but if you've been married for just a few years,
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.880]   I don't know exactly what the cutoff date is,
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.440]   but you could go and check it out.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.080]   So if you've been married for like a year, two years,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.400]   I think three years, I forget how many years,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.560]   go check it out yourself, okay?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.520]   The fellowship is for that,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.960]   they're having a quarterly seminar that's taking place
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   on September 30th at 1030, okay?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.720]   And that's a Saturday that's taking place here.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.820]   New round of membership class that's taking place
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.500]   on October 1st through November 19th.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.060]   So if you need to take membership class,
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.380]   that's taking place October 1st.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.540]   That happens on Sunday mornings at nine to 1020.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.020]   It's an eight-week course.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.860]   It goes over the fundamental doctrines
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.180]   of the Church of Christianity,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.420]   and also it'll expose you to the ministry philosophy
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.980]   and how we run things at church.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.720]   So if you wanna become a member of the church,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.560]   please sign up for that.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.940]   And again, first class for that is starting
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.320]   on October 1st on Sunday at nine o'clock.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.460]   Women's ministry tea time, October 14th, 930 to 12.
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.820]   Please sign up for that as well.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.160]   For Thanksgiving, we'll give you a more detailed announcement
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.820]   as we get closer to the date,
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.700]   but because of the size of the church,
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.820]   we're no longer able to have the whole church
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.700]   at the facility to do it.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.700]   So last year, we divided into different homes,
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.980]   and so the homes that are willing to host
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.380]   are gonna be volunteered,
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.860]   and then they're gonna assign some people in the church.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.540]   It's gonna be a mixed group of college and young adults
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.340]   and family ministry people.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.940]   So if you're willing to open up your home,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.060]   please let us know, and our logistics team
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.820]   will contact you on more information that you may need.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.220]   PBA, if you are interested in playing basketball,
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.580]   again, the sign up for that is last week,
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.740]   this week, and next week.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.960]   So you got two more weeks to sign up
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.980]   if you wanna participate in that.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.900]   We have one more announcement from our college ministry.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.460]   Pastor Nate's gonna come up and give an announcement.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.940]   - Hi, everyone.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.780]   My name is Nathan.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.180]   I'm the college pastor of this church.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.940]   Especially with the semester system
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.380]   having begun for college ministry,
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.500]   we know that the church is large,
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.780]   and so sometimes it's going to be easy
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.380]   to get lost in the fold,
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.700]   and so we wanna invite anyone
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.220]   who's newer to the college ministry,
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.900]   if you're a college-aged student here,
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.360]   there's gonna be a table out there
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.340]   with a black tablecloth there.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.500]   Please join us there.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.940]   We have a sign up there for rides
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.820]   if you need rides to any of our college events.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.220]   Some of our students will be out there
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.820]   if you'd like to meet any of them.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.900]   I'll be out there if you'd like to meet me.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.300]   So please come and join us there.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.860]   But the best thing that you can actually do
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.700]   is come and join us on Friday nights for Bible studies.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.420]   So it's gonna be at 7 p.m. in the cafe
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.660]   right across the way.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.740]   And so if you come to that,
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.500]   it really does shrink the church quite a bit.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   So we wanna welcome you to that.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.340]   Thanks.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.540]   - All right, so let me pray for the offering.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.180]   Again, if you brought a physical offering,
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.740]   we have a box in the back as you're exiting.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.860]   All right, let's pray.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.580]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the privilege
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.460]   that we have to come and worship you.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.740]   Help us, Lord God, to give what is sincere in our hearts,
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.760]   that this giving would simply represent our worship,
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.800]   that you are our Lord, you are our Savior.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.720]   You are the one that we worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.620]   I pray, Father God, that you would bless this time,
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.100]   even in this giving, that it would be a sweet aroma
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.620]   and may the offering that we give be multiplied
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.860]   by your hands, 30, 60, and hundredfold
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.460]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.180]   to Luke chapter six.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.380]   And again, today is the last day, okay?
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.680]   At least on this, on the 12th disciple.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.380]   I'm gonna read just 14 and 16, 14 through 16.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.840]   Simon whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.920]   and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.480]   and Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Apheus,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.760]   and Simon, who was called the zealot,
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.000]   Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.680]   who became a traitor.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.520]   Let's pray.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.360]   Father, give us understanding.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:17.560]   Give us a willing heart to obey, not just to listen.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.800]   We lift this time to you, asking for your spirit,
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.240]   Lord God, to use your word to guide and lead us.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.980]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.360]   You know, at our church, you know,
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   we always have numbers of visitors that come and ask,
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.240]   what's the sermon like, right?
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   What's the teaching like?
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.820]   And that's probably one of the key things
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.480]   that you look for when you're looking for a church.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.440]   And maybe some of you who've been here for a while, right?
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.920]   How do you evaluate if the sermon is a good sermon
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.680]   or a bad sermon, right?
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.440]   Is this, if this is a sermon that you should be listening to
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.680]   or what you gleaned from or not gleaned from.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.800]   If the goal of the sermon, right,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.520]   if the goal of the sermon is your encouragement,
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   that at the end of hearing the sermon,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.840]   that you feel strengthened and encouraged
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.880]   and, you know, so that you can go home
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.960]   and you can live a difficult life
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.040]   living in this fallen world, raising children
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.260]   and trying to make money and make ends meet
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.120]   and it's, life is hard enough as it is,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.480]   so you go to church to find encouragement.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.640]   So that's how you're gonna evaluate
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.780]   if the sermon was good or not.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.800]   Did I, did I feel encouraged at the end of it?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:34.120]   Maybe some people come because we're Bible teaching church
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.120]   and you're, came to our church thinking
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.040]   that was a Bible teaching.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.640]   So I wanna see if the Bible is actually taught.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.680]   And we can go to the other extreme thinking like,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.960]   a good sermon is if you exposit it, this word means this,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.560]   this words means that, and this is the syntax of this,
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.800]   and this is the Greek behind this,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.960]   and this is the history behind that,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.580]   and that's how you determine if a sermon was good or bad
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.480]   based upon the amount of information
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.280]   that you got about this text.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.040]   I think that's also an error
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.960]   because the goal of preaching isn't simply to inform you
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.200]   and to just let you know and just to kind of
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.960]   tell you information, 'cause if that's the case,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.440]   I think you'll get a lot more out of it
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.840]   if I just gave you a commentary and then afterwards
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.520]   you just came and tell us what you read, right?
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.840]   The goal of preaching is ultimately for God's glory
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.260]   and for his glory in the context of salvation,
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.720]   to bring sinners to Christ,
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.280]   so that they would repent and meet Christ.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.520]   So the preaching is a means for that goal.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.760]   Exposition and being accurate to the text
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.200]   is a means to that goal.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.600]   Preaching is to get those who repented
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.000]   that they would grow in their faith,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.160]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you,
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.880]   and ultimately give you hope so that you could eagerly wait
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.860]   for the coming of Christ.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.240]   That's the end goal of preaching, end goal of teaching.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.220]   So how we evaluate if it's a good sermon
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.620]   or not good sermon isn't simply am I encouraged,
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.740]   or isn't simply did I get all the facts
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.140]   that's necessary from this text,
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.740]   is it does this lead sinners to Christ
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.260]   through the accurate teaching of the word of God?
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.240]   Now I say all of this because the scriptures
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.660]   are filled with encouragements about the love of God
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.260]   and the grace of God, but it's also filled
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.500]   with warnings and judgment of consequence
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.680]   for those who do not repent.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.060]   It is filled with both.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.660]   So if I end up coming here with the end goal
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   of making sure that you don't get rocked
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.460]   and you feel encouraged and strengthened,
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.020]   then I gotta avoid these texts.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.140]   I gotta just skim through it,
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.980]   and I gotta always kinda make the angle
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.460]   that you don't get offended by what I say.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.140]   But because that is not the end goal of any sermon
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.480]   or any teaching, the end goal of it is
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.160]   am I conveying exactly what God said to sinners?
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.760]   Am I conveying exactly what God says to his children?
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.880]   When it is time to encourage, it is to encourage.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.240]   When it's time to warn, warning must come.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.360]   Judas serves as one of those warnings.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.240]   As much as we are encouraged by what the grace of God
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.760]   that he showed to the disciples,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.520]   here's a man who fell away despite being as close
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   as he could possibly be in the presence of Christ,
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.920]   literally saw, literally saw somebody come back
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   from the dead and chose to sell him out for 30 silvers,
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.220]   30 pieces of coin.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.400]   Now we talked about last week, why did he do that?
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   It's difficult to understand how somebody
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.680]   who was that close, who even experienced
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.080]   casting out demons and healing people by his own hands,
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.280]   was able to preach the gospel.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.000]   If we didn't know, if that aspect of the last part
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.040]   of his life where he sold out Christ for 30 pieces of silver
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.520]   and then he hangs himself, if that was not recorded
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.240]   in the Bible, we would automatically think
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.800]   that he was like every other disciple.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.280]   He gave his life, where did he die?
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.520]   How did he preach the gospel?
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.000]   What kind of reward would he have in heaven?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.800]   But because of what he did, it causes us
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.640]   to scratch our head, it's like how can somebody
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.540]   in that position who had that kind of privilege
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.880]   walk away from his faith?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.000]   We talked about last week, clearly Judas
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.600]   was not a Christian.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.080]   The Bible says that he left us because he was not of us.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.840]   Him doing what he did and dying the way he died
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.360]   proved that he wasn't a genuine believer.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.840]   So the question that we ask is can somebody
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.160]   who bore fruit, cast out demons, even healed people,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.660]   could that possibly be a non-Christian?
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.600]   Can somebody who's serving in the church,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.520]   became a leader in the church, maybe even went out
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.440]   to mission, went to seminary and started preaching
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.140]   the gospel and many people were drawn in,
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.580]   maybe a pastor of a mega church,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.020]   maybe he's a celebrity pastor,
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.520]   could that be a non-Christian?
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.500]   Clearly the answer is yes, it could be.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.100]   If Judas, who was a member of the 12 disciples,
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.820]   apostles, if he was proven to be a non-Christian,
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.660]   clearly no position and no fruit or nothing
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.340]   that we can just pinpoint externally
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:36.500]   can be absolute proof if Judas clearly was not a Christian.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.520]   And so we see that Judas was not a Christian
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.020]   because of the way he ended up taking his life.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.240]   And we saw that last week, that it wasn't simply
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.120]   because he couldn't see, it's because he didn't want to see.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.780]   He was blinded by his lust for money.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.180]   As we are warned in scripture, he says,
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.980]   the lust of money, love of money is the root
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.840]   of all kinds of evil.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   And in our pursuit of money, it blinds us
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.380]   because we box God in.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.580]   The love of money ends up boxing God in
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.860]   to this little box that whatever he says,
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.140]   if it doesn't fit into this box,
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.240]   if he somehow challenges the life that I've set,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.300]   the things that I'm pursuing, the way I spend money,
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.600]   the way I collect money, the way I pursue money,
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.220]   if something that he says in the scripture
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.300]   causes us to challenge that, we automatically think
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.380]   that that cannot be from God.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.180]   God would never say this.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.660]   And so we create a theology where God would never
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.900]   come outside of this box.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.460]   And that's what love of money does.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.740]   It blinds us to see.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.020]   And it's not just love of money.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:48.020]   Obviously, love of money is pervasive and is universal.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.540]   Sometimes it could be love of our family.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.340]   And Jesus himself says in Matthew chapter 15, 37,
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.140]   he says, "He who loves his father or mother
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.380]   "or his son or daughter more than me
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.260]   "cannot be my disciple."
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.220]   Now, obviously, he's not telling us not to love
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.640]   our mother or father, not to love our son and daughter.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.020]   But he's saying sometimes your love for mother or father,
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.900]   sometimes your love for your own children can blind you.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.700]   That you're hearing and studying the word of God
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.180]   and you box him in, that anything that he challenges us
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.260]   to make it uncomfortable, that maybe that we need to,
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.760]   in certain things, to put God first before our children,
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.640]   clearly God cannot be saying that.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.500]   So it blinds us to the truth.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.500]   Because we will not allow God to speak outside of this box.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.440]   Sometimes it could be our own friends.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.860]   You know, you come to church and one of the greatest
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:47.820]   benefits of being in a church is you have other friends
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.080]   that you can run this race with and you came in
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.020]   and you see the power of community and how that helps you.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.700]   But the same thing that helps you
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.460]   can also be a great hindrance.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.740]   When you will not allow God to speak beyond
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.440]   the boundaries of your friendship.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.860]   That you can never move beyond that.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.900]   You can never make any decisions or do anything
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.180]   that's gonna cause us to walk away from that.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.820]   There are times when God will call you to leave.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.260]   There are times when God will call you to go.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.900]   But when our friends become our idol,
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.740]   we cannot see beyond the boundaries that we set for God.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.340]   And that's why he says that whatever we've made idols
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.060]   in our lives, we are closing our eyes to anything
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.460]   that doesn't fit into this box.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.660]   And that's exactly what happened to Judas.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.620]   He was blinded by his money.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.960]   He was blinded by it.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.460]   And when he thought that he wasn't gonna get it,
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.820]   that Jesus was actually gonna go to the cross,
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.060]   he wanted to make sure that he salvaged something
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.780]   from this and which caused him,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.240]   even as much privilege that he had, he could not see.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.100]   Thirdly, and the scripture makes it very clear,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.660]   he was possessed by the devil.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.960]   There was demonic work behind what he did.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.500]   In Luke chapter 22, verse three, it says,
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.660]   "Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot,
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.300]   "belonging to the number of the 12."
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.540]   You notice here it says Satan entered him.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.560]   And then you look at Luke chapter 22, verse 31.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.260]   Jesus says to Peter, "Satan has asked permission
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.780]   "to sift you, the disciples, and you in particular."
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.940]   But you notice here how Satan has to ask permission
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.220]   to sift them, to test them, to challenge them.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.060]   But when it comes to Judas, there's no asking permission.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:35.980]   He just does it.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.620]   See, the difference between Judas
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.700]   and different between the other disciples,
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.340]   Judas already belonged to Satan.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.060]   Judas already belonged to Satan,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.220]   so Satan didn't ask to have permission to go at him.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.200]   See, the other disciples were under Jesus' care.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.380]   So in order for Satanic work to happen with them,
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.420]   he said he asked permission.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.820]   He couldn't just go at them.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.280]   Satan was possessed.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.700]   You know what's really interesting is
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.700]   when you see the demonic work that's happening,
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.540]   obviously if you're not a Christian
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.020]   and you're not under the protection,
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.260]   the Bible says the God of this age is Satan.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.660]   And Satan is real.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.700]   If you believe God is real, Satan is real.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.620]   And the scripture says those who are not under
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.260]   the blood of Christ, who are not covered
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.000]   under the blood of Christ, the God of this age
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.160]   has free reign on you.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   He has free reign on you.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.340]   He's toying with you.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.780]   He's messing with you because he wants his own glory.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.200]   So sometimes he'll give you,
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.460]   sometimes he'll take away.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.980]   All of that for the purpose of his own glory
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.180]   'cause he doesn't want you giving glory to God.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:46.140]   You know what's interesting is in John 8:31-32,
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.860]   and again, I've mentioned this so many times
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.660]   in our church history, but I really want you
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.700]   to be impacted by what this says
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.060]   because there's so much confusion in our generation
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.900]   as to who is and is not a Christian,
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.420]   who has saving faith.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.400]   In John 8:31-32, Jesus was saying to those Jews
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.120]   who had believed him,
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.100]   to those who said that they believed,
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.320]   and don't miss this because this is crucial.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.280]   He was talking to people who believed him.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.440]   If you continue in my word, if you continue in my word,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.980]   he doesn't say you're saved.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.560]   Since you say that you believe, you're saved,
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.120]   you're confirmed, don't worry about anything.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.280]   Hopefully the word of God will abide in you
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.200]   and you're gonna experience this freedom.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.040]   He doesn't say that.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.080]   He said to those who believe him, he said,
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.000]   if you continue in my word,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.560]   then you are truly disciples of mine
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.840]   and you will know the truth
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.520]   and the truth will make you free.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.040]   He has a condition that he places on the people
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.780]   who said that they believed.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.340]   Now we know for a fact that they weren't Christians
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.120]   because they get offended by this.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.200]   What do you mean to be set free?
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.400]   We were never slaves.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   We're Abraham's children and they go back and forth,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.600]   back and forth and they're not relenting
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.880]   because they're offended.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.800]   They love the fact that Jesus was talking about the kingdom
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.720]   and healing and feeding and they loved it.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.840]   I mean, here's our next Messiah, the King of Israel,
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.680]   who's all powerful, all caring.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.080]   He's healing people who are blind.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   Who wouldn't love him?
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.280]   Who wouldn't follow him?
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.240]   And yet Jesus knows exactly what's in their heart.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.920]   They're following him and he says,
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.320]   you must have true faith.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.200]   As a result of this interaction back and forth,
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.520]   he says to them in verse 32, Jesus said to them,
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.400]   and again, the them he's referring to
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.260]   are the same people that he was talking to in verse 31,
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.960]   to those who had believed.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.060]   If God were your father, you would love me
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.860]   for I proceeded forth and have come from God
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.040]   for I have not even come on my own initiative,
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.340]   but he sent me.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.040]   Why do you not understand what I am saying?
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.140]   It is because you cannot hear my word.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.920]   You are of your father, the devil.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.480]   I remember the first time I was studying through this text
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.680]   and I said, wait a second, this is the same context.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.880]   Did he go somewhere else and talking to a new people?
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.360]   I said, no, he's talking to the same people.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.160]   To those who had believed, he said,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.860]   your father is the devil.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.240]   And you want to do the desires of your father,
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.520]   he was a murderer from the beginning
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.160]   and does not stand in the truth
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.560]   because there is no truth in him.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.240]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.220]   for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.240]   So how could this be?
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.040]   Now you can listen to this and if this bothers you,
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.080]   you can say, ah, you know, Peter's always saying
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.760]   the same thing, he's a legalist.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.600]   You don't have to listen to me.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.280]   Wrestle with the text.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.440]   Wrestle with the text.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.640]   Wrestle with what you see in the scriptures.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.280]   And if I am, I'm happy to just lean on one thing,
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.400]   okay, you can discard me.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.960]   But wrestle with the text.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.080]   What does he mean here?
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.640]   Talking to professing believers.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.760]   No, I think James clarifies that later
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.460]   in the epistle of James.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.080]   He says, faith without deed is dead.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.060]   If you profess that you believe in God, that's good.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.100]   Even the demons believe that and they shudder.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.160]   Even the demons profess and they shudder.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.180]   Demon.
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.640]   So he's talking to people who have demonic faith.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:35.140]   They have demonic faith or professing,
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.520]   but don't really believe.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.220]   They're just kind of acknowledging.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.520]   We want you to be our Messiah
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.800]   because you have all these powers.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.360]   You're performing all these miracles.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.780]   Remember, even Judas performed all these things.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.380]   Even Judas had these powers.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.860]   Judas serves as a warning,
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.280]   especially in our culture where there's so much confusion.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.840]   Who isn't a believer?
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:04.200]   You know, I was,
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.880]   something popped up on my Facebook.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.280]   I think it was last night.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   You guys know who Trevor Noah is?
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.240]   Am I getting his name right, Trevor Noah?
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.160]   He's the host for Daily News.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.080]   Is it Daily News?
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.640]   Whatever it is, it's the Daily something, right?
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   And he came up and he was doing an interview
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.600]   because the people who were interviewing him
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.280]   were either atheists or Muslim,
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.920]   and he said, "I'm of the fun faith."
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.080]   I was raised as a Protestant.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.240]   I was a Christian.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.920]   And he's like, "What do you mean by fun faith?"
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.200]   I'm of the fun faith because all you have to do is believe
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.240]   and you get to go to heaven.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.060]   It's so fun.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.040]   There's no drudgery.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.120]   There's no burden.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.760]   You just need to believe.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.880]   And then he quoted King James, John 3:16.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.600]   For God so loved the world
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.560]   that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.520]   whoever believes in him shall not perish,
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.000]   but have everlasting life.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.320]   And he quoted verbatim.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.240]   So you could tell he went to Sunday school.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.080]   And he was challenging the other people
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   who have other religions,
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.360]   like you guys have to wear this,
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.160]   you can't do that, you can't eat this, but that's not us.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   You just have to believe.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.360]   That's why it's so fun.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.920]   We're of the fun faith.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.040]   Now, as ridiculous as that may sound,
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.800]   that is the Christianity that's being propagated
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.120]   all around the world.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.540]   Just believe.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.800]   If that's all, if that's all, if you just profess,
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.880]   if you just raise your hand, give Jesus a try,
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.740]   what do you got to lose?
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.680]   You know, I heard this meme,
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.920]   or I don't know what you call it,
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.520]   that's been going around saying,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.240]   if I'm wrong, I wasted nothing, right?
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.560]   I die, I become nothing.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.980]   If you're wrong, right, you go to hell.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:57.160]   So if I'm wrong, I wasted nothing.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.680]   Meaning, I just believed and I lived my life,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.360]   enjoyed it, I got married, had kids,
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.520]   and I just happened to believe.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.440]   It sounds so godly and truthful, but blasphemous.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   When the scripture makes it clear,
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.720]   he who finds his life shall lose it.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.880]   If you want to follow after me, deny himself,
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.080]   pick up the cross and follow me.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.480]   Where Christ says, if you believe me,
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.800]   leave everything and follow me.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.380]   And it's the modern day Christian who has come up with,
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.320]   well, I lose nothing.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.080]   You lose nothing 'cause you never really knew Christ.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.540]   Because if this wasn't real,
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.600]   if what I'm preaching is fake, I've lost everything.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.720]   Every Sunday I was here,
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.080]   every minute that I studied to prepare for the Bible,
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.800]   every minute that I had an opportunity
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.400]   to make another dollar that I missed
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.600]   because I wanted to follow Christ first,
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.940]   I lost everything.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.680]   All my friends, everything that I desired,
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.580]   the promises that I made to my parents when I was young,
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.960]   that I would take care of them,
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.400]   that I would make you money, I lost everything.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   If this is not true, every single penny that you paid,
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.640]   everything that you sacrificed,
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.520]   trying to love people that are unlovable,
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.700]   all that is wasted time, wasted energy.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:23.440]   Everything that you did because you believe in Christ
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   was wasted.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.280]   Either you believe in Christ
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.720]   and you receive his new life and you put away your old.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.800]   And if this is not true, according to Paul,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.120]   we are to be pitied.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   We are to be pitied.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.280]   See, Satan doesn't have that kind of power over us
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.880]   where he can enter us, but we do have warnings.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.960]   In 2 Corinthians 2, 10 through 11, he says,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.920]   "But one whom you forgive anything,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.400]   "forgive anything, I forgive also,
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.160]   "for indeed what I have forgiven,
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.360]   "if I have forgiven anything,
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.480]   "I did it for your sake in the presence of Christ
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.860]   "so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan,
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.400]   "for we are not ignorant of his schemes."
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   In other words, if you have a grudge
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.800]   and you choose not to forgive
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.760]   and you hold onto it with your life,
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   he says you've opened the door for Satanic influence.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.900]   He can never possess us, but he can influence us.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.280]   If you have unrepentant sins that you're holding onto,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.920]   you're giving room for Satan to use at the scheme.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.720]   In Ephesians 4, 26 to 27,
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.260]   "Be angry and yet do not sin,
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.220]   "do not let the sun go down on your anger,
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.720]   "do not give the devil an opportunity."
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.120]   The word for opportunity here
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.400]   literally means to make room for the devil.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.600]   If you have a grudge and you're angry,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.560]   and say, "I don't wanna let this go,
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.400]   "I want vengeance, I want justice."
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.800]   And you aren't willing to let it go,
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.760]   he says you're making room for Satanic influence.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.560]   So like you have a house and you clean the room out,
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.800]   put a nice bedding in, and you don't lock it,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.760]   and you just kinda welcome.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.580]   You didn't go out and say,
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.040]   "Hey, we welcome you to come in,"
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.440]   but he said when you allow that to persist in your life,
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.800]   you're making room for Satanic influence.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.840]   First Peter 5, 8 said,
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.860]   "Be of sober spirit, beyond the alert,
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.420]   "your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.120]   "seeking someone to devour."
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.280]   Our enemy is not like a lion in a zoo
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.920]   who's been well-fed and just resting for us to observe,
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.960]   and good thing that he's behind bars and he's well-fed.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.760]   We're just there to just remind us
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.500]   that this creature exists.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.060]   He says, "No, he's among us.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:45.460]   "He's walking, he's looking, he's seeking to devour."
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.660]   That's why we're warned.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.660]   Don't give the devil an opportunity
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.140]   to scheme and to influence.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.140]   And if you're being influenced,
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.140]   your emotions, your thoughts
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:03.260]   can be in the process of being influenced
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.660]   because you've given the foothold
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.400]   for the devil to come and work.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.660]   Judas was a man who was not under the protection
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.700]   because he was not a believer,
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.380]   because he gave into his lust, caused him to be blind,
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.260]   and there was clearly Satanic work
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.700]   behind what happened to him.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.280]   Fourthly,
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.740]   Judas did what he did because it was prophesied.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.680]   It was to prove who Jesus was.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.160]   John 13, 8 through 19,
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.840]   "I do not speak of all of you.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.640]   "I know the one I have chosen,
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.500]   "but it is that the scripture may be fulfilled.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.020]   "He who eats my bread and has lifted up his heel against me
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.860]   "from now on, I am telling you, before it comes to pass,
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.420]   "so that when it does occur,
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.660]   "you may believe that I am he."
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.900]   As if he didn't give enough proof.
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.420]   Just in case you need another one.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.180]   Just in case after everything that I've done,
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.860]   just in case if raising Lazarus from the dead,
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.180]   walking on the water, feeding the 5,000,
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.660]   if all of that wasn't enough,
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.260]   when you see what happens so that you may know
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.220]   that this was prophesied and I am he.
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.620]   He gave evidence after evidence after evidence
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.420]   after evidence.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:17.140]   John 15, 25, "But they have done this to fulfill the word
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.340]   "that it was written in the law
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.140]   "that they hated me without a cause."
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.200]   324 prophecies were fulfilled in Christ.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.980]   Now, I don't know who counted it.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.900]   There's always somebody who likes counting, right?
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.340]   These engineer types make a spreadsheet.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.700]   How many were prophesied, how many were fulfilled,
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.460]   and they counted 324.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:39.100]   I'm just gonna trust them, right?
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.340]   They said 324 different things that he said
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.540]   was fulfilled in the life of Christ.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:50.100]   You know, I don't know how many times I've talked to people
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.540]   and then they want evidence.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:53.540]   They want evidence.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.580]   Remember Jesus said they kept on asking for evidence
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.700]   that the wicked and evil generation,
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.740]   I will give no evidence except for the sign of Jonah.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.700]   Some people look at that and say,
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.020]   well, Jesus didn't wanna give any evidence.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.860]   He's just gonna leave one.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.860]   Remember why he said that.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.060]   He said that because he gave evidence after evidence
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.220]   after evidence, 324 different fulfilled prophecies,
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.620]   and at the end of seeing all the evidence,
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.420]   they said, prove yourself.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.700]   Prove yourself.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.500]   After everything that he's done, he said, prove yourself.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.960]   And as to them, he said, the wicked and evil generation,
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.660]   there's no amount of proof that I'm gonna give
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.100]   to cause you to open your eyes.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.180]   If you're gonna seek, I'm gonna give you one
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.580]   that's gonna last, the sign of Jonah.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.540]   It wasn't that he gave the only sign was the sign of Jonah.
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:46.220]   He gave all kinds of signs, but they refused to believe
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.940]   'cause they didn't want that Messiah.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:54.100]   The Messiah that they wanted, Jesus didn't fit into that box.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.620]   He challenged their religious system.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.900]   He challenged their spending.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.540]   He challenged their prayer habits.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.980]   He challenged their giving.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.780]   He challenged the way they were raising children.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.380]   He challenged the way they were getting married.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.500]   He challenged the way they were getting divorced.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.500]   And so he didn't fit into that box,
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.220]   so they didn't want him.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.140]   So even after giving all the evidence,
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.260]   he said, it's not enough.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:17.280]   So they weren't asking to prove himself.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.540]   They were challenging him to disprove him.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:25.400]   But if you want evidence, if you want evidence,
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.860]   there's more than enough.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:32.340]   That's why he says, he who searches me with all his heart,
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.380]   he who seeks me with all his heart.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.980]   Most people say, I can't believe that.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.900]   It's written by men, it's this, it's that,
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.340]   and everybody claims to have the truth,
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.980]   so how can we believe everything?
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:48.340]   The way that our generation comes to a conclusion
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.300]   of what is true and not is so lazy,
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.900]   and it's more of an evidence of our hardened heart.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.180]   If I stood here today and say I was Michael Jordan,
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.660]   I'm Michael Jordan, right?
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.660]   How many of you sit there, I'm confused.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.780]   He says he's Michael Jordan.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.100]   How can there be two Michael Jordan?
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.620]   And then that guy in the homeless shelter,
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:09.860]   he says he's Michael Jordan, right?
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.900]   So I'm confused.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.540]   How can they all say they're Michael Jordan?
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:17.420]   So either they're all Michael Jordan,
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.300]   or I don't trust anybody.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.100]   It's clear, if you're willing to dig,
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.060]   if you wanted to find out,
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.620]   maybe you don't know what Michael Jordan looks like,
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.100]   and all you have to do is Michael Jordan,
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.460]   his picture will come out and say,
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.460]   how can this guy be Michael Jordan?
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.420]   He doesn't have the same eye shape, right?
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.260]   Pretty clear, right?
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.700]   He said wicked and evil generation,
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.580]   I will give no evidence,
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.540]   because enough evidence has been given.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:47.620]   So if you want evidence, evidence is there.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:52.020]   But if among that, if the word of God has been gone
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:55.020]   and you still will not believe, you're not gonna believe.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.740]   First Corinthians 4, three to four says,
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.180]   and even if our gospel is veiled,
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.100]   it is veiled to those who are perishing,
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.780]   in whose case the God of this world
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.780]   has blinded the minds of the unbelieving
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.780]   so that they might not see the light of the gospel,
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.580]   the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:14.580]   Even the minute details of Judas' betrayal was prophesied.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:19.940]   Breaking a bread, close his companion,
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:24.380]   betraying him with a kiss, all of that was prophesied.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:29.380]   Nail on the cross, his companions dispersing,
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:34.060]   crucifixion on a tree, the mocking, the signs,
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.660]   all of it, every single one of it was prophesied.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.620]   So if anybody had any interest to look into that,
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.820]   how can you possibly not believe?
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:49.980]   Judas' betrayal was another sign of who he was.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.500]   But fifth and finally, Judas' betrayal
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:59.300]   demonstrates his love toward us.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.460]   Judas' betrayal demonstrates his love toward us.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:04.820]   He says, Romans 5, eight,
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.180]   that God demonstrates his own love toward us
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:11.040]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.340]   He says he demonstrated, he demonstrated
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:21.340]   and displayed his love in the context
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:26.140]   of the greatest darkness so that you may be able to see
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.940]   the depth and length and height
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.860]   and width of the love of Christ.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.180]   If you wanna see the stars,
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.620]   you have to go to a place where there's no light.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.080]   And that's exactly what happened
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.900]   when Jesus was crucified on the cross.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.540]   In fact, all of the recording of the gospel
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.380]   is the rejection of Christ.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.020]   You would think after three years of showing miracles
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.660]   and loving them and caring for them and feeding them,
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:53.580]   that there would have been a crowd waiting for Jesus,
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.040]   preventing the cross.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.340]   But that didn't happen.
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.740]   At the end of two and a half years
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.260]   of performing miracle after miracle after miracle after
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.140]   miracle, Jesus said, you are following me
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.540]   because I gave you bread and you want more.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:11.680]   You don't know who I am.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.140]   I am the bread of life.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.260]   I didn't come to you so that you can be filled
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.080]   in your stomach.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.740]   I came so that you can have spiritual life.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.780]   He who eats of the bread of the world will be hungry again.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:26.060]   He who drinks of the world will be thirsty again,
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.860]   but I am the living water.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.900]   The water that I give you will well up in you eternal life
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.060]   and you will never thirst again,
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.500]   but that's not what you want.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:40.220]   You must drink of my blood and eat of my flesh.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.540]   I have no relationship with you.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:42.980]   He's talking about the cross.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.220]   And they all turned away and rejected him.
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:52.060]   After they rejected him, Jesus starts going to Jerusalem
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:53.740]   and as he is heading to Jerusalem,
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.100]   he prophesied to the disciples,
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.660]   he's not just gonna be crucified,
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.020]   he's gonna be crucified because the leaders of Israel
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.080]   is gonna betray him and they're gonna turn him over.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.460]   And so they will be rejected by the people of Israel.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.140]   He will be rejected by the leaders of Israel.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.620]   He will be rejected by the leaders of the pagan world.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:18.240]   And then he said he will be rejected by his own disciples.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.900]   God demonstrates his love toward us
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.680]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.500]   You know, whenever you enter a covenant relationship,
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.620]   if you want to test the quality of a covenant relationship,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.820]   it doesn't happen during your honeymoon stage.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:45.660]   During your honeymoon stage, like nothing bothers you.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.100]   Your wife has bad breath, it's like,
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.860]   of course everybody has bad breath, it's an easy fix.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.580]   It just doesn't bother you.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.940]   That's why they call it honeymoon stage.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.060]   You're just like walking on water.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.420]   They can't do no wrong.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.540]   They can snore in the middle of the night
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.420]   and you're like, wow, isn't that cute?
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.200]   It's like a koala sleeping.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.420]   (congregation laughing)
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.820]   So the quality of the covenant relationship
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.640]   isn't tested during the honeymoon stage
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.100]   because in a honeymoon stage,
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.340]   even the worst of relationships seem great.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:24.900]   But it's when that's over and you start to see the sins
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.220]   of your wife and your husband
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.100]   and the selfishness starts to come out
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.420]   and the things that you try to hide
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.740]   and all of a sudden they come out
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.820]   and it doesn't look like a koala.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.260]   You know what I mean?
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.620]   I'm not gonna say what it looks like,
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.500]   but it just is not cute anymore.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.100]   Oh my gosh, I can't sleep.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.980]   Can you please pick up your socks?
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.180]   How many times did I ask you to do the dishes
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.960]   and you're so selfish?
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.460]   The quality of our love in our covenant relationship
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.740]   is tested and proven through trials and difficulties
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.100]   when it is difficult to love,
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.040]   when it just doesn't happen automatically.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.780]   And in the context of everything in you would have run,
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.620]   but because of your love and commitment.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.100]   And so if you've gone through all of that,
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:15.940]   at the end of that,
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.380]   you know that the quality of your love is much more pure
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.840]   than it was in the beginning.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.380]   He says he demonstrates his love toward us
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.940]   and he wanted us to see
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:32.260]   that his love for us wasn't contingent
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.380]   upon us being pretty.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.720]   Or handsome.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.920]   Or potential.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.680]   He said it was while we were yet sinners,
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.940]   Christ died for us.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:49.500]   How many of you, if you knew,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.560]   your best friend sitting next to you
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.260]   in a year's time is gonna stab you in the back,
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.740]   will be able to maintain your relationship?
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.500]   You wouldn't.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.140]   Next time, if you knew that for a fact,
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.860]   you're gonna go out and you had a lunch appointment
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.140]   with this person, you're gonna sit there
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.460]   and all you can think about is, you jerk.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.940]   It's gonna affect your bubble time,
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.340]   your Bible study, whatever it is that you had planned.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.380]   We're supposed to go fishing,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.260]   we're supposed to go to Disneyland together.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.860]   Because you know, he's gonna betray me next year.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.460]   It's gonna affect every part of what you do with that person.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.340]   You're not gonna be able to enjoy
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.620]   anything you do with that person,
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.340]   let alone love them.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.080]   It's gonna disgust you.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.220]   And no one is even gonna blame you
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.520]   if you broke up that relationship
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.980]   and never called them and wiped them out.
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.720]   It's like, don't ever call me, don't come to my house.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.220]   Because that's how sinners behave
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.580]   when we're wronged.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:00.380]   And yet, it says in John 6:64,
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.120]   "But there are some of you who do not believe,
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.520]   "for Jesus knew from the beginning
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.780]   "who they were who did not believe
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.900]   "and who it was that would betray him."
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.200]   He knew from the beginning.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.820]   He knew from the beginning that his 11 disciples
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.340]   were gonna fail him.
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.620]   He knew from the beginning that Peter
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.940]   was going to look in his face and say,
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.860]   "I don't know this man."
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.180]   He knew from the beginning that Judas was gonna betray him,
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.540]   and yet he loved him the same.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.460]   And when he prophesied at the communion table
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.340]   that one of you guys are gonna do this,
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.100]   nobody could tell the difference.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.840]   'Cause Jesus never treated him any different.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.000]   Jesus washed his feet, loved him,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.960]   cared for him, protected him, and fed him.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.200]   Every single one of them.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.720]   As much as we talk about how only the blood of Christ
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   can cleanse us, because he's the only one
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.000]   who's able to cleanse us because of his deity,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.480]   because of who he is.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.240]   Not only could we not die for other people's sins
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.480]   because we don't have the ability,
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.940]   we cannot die for other people's sins
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.940]   because we don't have the will.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.520]   How easily we stiff-arm people
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.820]   because they might hurt us.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.700]   They might say something hurtful.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:21.000]   How many of you who've been jaded
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.440]   because of your past relationship,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.840]   and somebody reminds you of that person,
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.960]   and you've already stiffed-armed those groups of people
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.540]   because of what has happened?
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.500]   It is so easy for us.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.220]   It is impossible for us.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.300]   It is impossible for us.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.200]   Not only do we not have the ability,
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.020]   we don't have the will to love sinners.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:53.500]   Christ demonstrates his love toward us.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:58.160]   While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.980]   1 Peter 3, 18 says, "For Christ also died for sins
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.660]   "once for all, the just for the unjust."
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.220]   The just for the unjust.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.880]   That only happened one time in human history.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.380]   One time.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.460]   And the reason why there was only one time
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.940]   is because there was only one that was just.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:23.620]   There are many that are unjust.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.400]   The world was filled with unjust people.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.540]   Our relationship, our churches are filled
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:34.100]   with unjust people, but there was only one just, Christ.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.140]   There was only one righteous.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.740]   There was only one who was holy.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:42.620]   And he gave his life that you and I may have life in him.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.740]   That's the demonstration of his love.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:52.120]   We think like, oh, you know, I understand his love
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.620]   because I love my children, or my mom loves me this way.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.340]   It's like, yeah, that's probably the closest thing
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.940]   that you and I could possibly relate to.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.620]   But even the love of mom, even the love of dad,
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:08.460]   cannot come close to the love that you and I
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.500]   have received in Christ.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.020]   That even, even in this injustice,
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.920]   even in this horrible sin,
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:22.600]   God intended to show us who he is.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.860]   God intended to show us.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.140]   In Romans 9, 20 to 23, what if God,
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.340]   although willing to demonstrate his wrath
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.900]   and to make his power known,
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.180]   endured with much patience vessels of wrath
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.780]   prepared for destruction, and he did so
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.700]   to make known the riches of his glory
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.140]   upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.480]   for glory, even the betrayal of Judas,
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.920]   he allowed to show us, to demonstrate to us his love.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:55.060]   You see why our whole Christian life
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.480]   is meant to be a response to this love.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.620]   It's not obligation, it's not, you better do this,
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.740]   or there's gonna be consequences.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.740]   Yes, the Bible is filled with warnings.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.900]   But what God desires more than anything else
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.680]   is people who worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.780]   And true worship that happens in spirit and in truth
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.140]   is when you begin to understand the depth
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.140]   of the love of Christ and the grace of Christ,
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.220]   depth of his patience that brought us to this point
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:31.020]   despite you, despite you, despite the sins
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.580]   that you know that you become experts in hiding,
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:38.740]   despite becoming a professional,
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.740]   of putting on a good show on the surface.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.220]   You know what's in your heart.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.380]   You know the slander, you know the impurity,
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.780]   you know the jealousy.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.180]   And yet, knowing all of that, he didn't turn away.
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.580]   He didn't turn away, he came to us.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.220]   And he embraced us.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:03.780]   And he was beaten, and he was crucified.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.780]   Let me leave you with this encouragement.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:13.380]   Judas' final destination clearly was condemnation.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:17.260]   Because at the end of it, when he realized what he did,
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:22.180]   he had worldly sorrow, and the only way to deal
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.660]   with his worldly sorrow was to end his life.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:28.460]   'Cause he did not understand, nor did he want to know
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.980]   the grace of God.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.820]   He hung himself, fell to the ground,
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:36.180]   injured his foot, that's how his life ended.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:41.420]   See what the disciples, Peter in particular,
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.220]   denied Jesus to his face.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.380]   To his face, to his face.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   To his face.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.060]   After everything he said, after everything Jesus has done.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.860]   And he was also sorrowful.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.300]   But he repented.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.020]   He asked for forgiveness.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.780]   And Jesus extended his tender hands and said,
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.140]   "Peter, do you really love me?
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.180]   Do you love me more than this?
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.020]   Do you love me?"
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.860]   And restored him, because he asked for forgiveness.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:17.460]   See the difference between an unbeliever and a believer
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.940]   is not we are so much better.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.300]   It's not we're more disciplined,
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.460]   or we have more knowledge.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.700]   It's that we recognize the grace of God
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.100]   and the need for his grace, and we come to him
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.300]   instead of running from him.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.740]   We come to him in weakness.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.620]   We come to him because we're desperate.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.020]   We come to him because we know that the only answer
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.740]   to our sin is the love of Christ.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.540]   So we come to him, and we are covered over,
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.860]   and over, and over again by his grace.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.700]   And so the longer we live,
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.940]   the more disappointed I am of myself,
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:58.500]   but the more I am excited about the Christ
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.900]   that I will meet one day.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:05.940]   After all that he has endured in my life,
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:10.740]   let alone what I see in the world,
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.940]   I don't have to look so far for darkness.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.620]   I don't have to look so far for disappointment,
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.980]   because it's already in me.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.420]   I thought I'd be much further along in my faith.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.700]   I thought I'd be much more patient.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.460]   I thought I would have a much better grasp
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.300]   of the word of God.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.740]   I thought I'd be much more disciplined at this age.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.700]   After almost 40 years of walking with God,
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.020]   I have less confidence in my flesh than when I first started.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.100]   But I love Christ much more.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.500]   Because of what he has done.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:48.500]   I understand a little bit better today than years past,
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.820]   what that compelling of his love means.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.540]   As Paul says, "I am compelled by the love of Christ."
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:58.420]   And this is Paul, he's like, "They're questioning me.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:11:59.260]   "They're bothering me.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.060]   "They're slandering me."
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.700]   And he says, "But I am compelled by the love of Christ
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.540]   "to love you."
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:10.940]   So my prayer for us, even as we think of Judas,
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.860]   even as we think of the tragedy of his life,
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.060]   that in the context of that,
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.060]   God demonstrates his love toward us.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.300]   Come to Christ.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.140]   Come to Christ.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:27.500]   Not in your good deeds, not because of your potential,
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.260]   because we're desperate without it.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.860]   Meet the true Christ.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.020]   Not the Christ of the culture.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.740]   Not the Christ that was just handed out like candy.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:47.580]   But the true Christ, that despite everything,
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:52.580]   he came, loved us, suffered, died, and resurrected
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:55.820]   so that we may be saved from this empty way of life
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.780]   and that we may live the rest of our life
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:01.340]   hoping that eternity will come when he comes.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.300]   Let's pray.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.720]   (pastor and congregation murmuring)
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:23.420]   Father, help us.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:28.260]   Lord, we're so easily distracted.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.780]   We're so easily tempted.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.260]   Lord, we thank you for opening our eyes
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:39.060]   so that we would no longer live as if we're blind.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.540]   Thank you, Father God,
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.260]   that your kindness led us to repentance.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.340]   But even now, Father, we wrestle, we struggle
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.900]   with our flesh, we struggle, Lord God, with fear
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:58.340]   that if we give all to you, that somehow
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.940]   our life is gonna become harder,
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.460]   our children are gonna suffer.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:06.140]   Help us, Lord God, to trust in you with all our might,
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.260]   to seek you, to know, Father God,
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.860]   that true life is in you and you alone.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:15.460]   Help us to number our days,
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.780]   that all that we wrestle with, all that we are tempted by,
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.260]   it's just a mist that comes and goes,
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.540]   that you would give us the wisdom
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.180]   to invest in eternal things.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:36.180]   To fix our eyes on Christ, the author
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.060]   and the finisher of our faith.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.300]   We love you.
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.620]   Help us to love you even more.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.260]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.

[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.960]   - Isaiah 53, three to four.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.720]   He was despised and forsaken of men,
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.920]   a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.960]   And like one from whom men hide their face,
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.720]   he was despised.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.320]   He did not esteem him.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.320]   Surely our grief he himself bore
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   and our sorrows he carried.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.800]   Yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken,
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.080]   smitten of God and afflicted.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.040]   Gracious Father, help us

[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.920]   to be compelled to worship,
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.280]   to be compelled to forsake this world,
