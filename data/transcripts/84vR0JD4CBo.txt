[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   Then you shall fall on bed in me,

[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   Oh, praise Him.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   Alleluia.

[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   Alleluia.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:11.400]   All right, good morning, and welcome to Bering Community
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.480]   Church.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.680]   We have, again, quite a few announcements to get through.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.400]   Again, as a reminder, our Kimco parking
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.440]   is for the families with young children.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.720]   And you're welcome to park across the street over at Alliant.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.600]   But again, we're doing this in order
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.040]   so that we would have less of the children crossing
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.840]   the street when the traffic is coming.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.200]   And so please keep that in mind.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   We need more volunteers for babies--
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.160]   sorry, I got all this mixed up--
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.880]   volunteers for sign up for trunk formation.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.640]   So for the Halloween period, we have people come in and open up
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.760]   their trunk and decorating.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.680]   And so the kids usually have games
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.920]   that are set up for that.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.360]   If you want to come and help out with that,
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.720]   to set up a trunk in a parking lot,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.000]   they're asking for more sign-ups for that.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.640]   And that's taking place on October 31 from 5:30 to 8:30.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.480]   So you need to come a little bit earlier.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.720]   And all the candy and stuff will be provided for you.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   So if you just sign up, they'll give you
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.320]   more instructions for that.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.480]   Jubilee Fellowship, if you're 50 and over,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.240]   we have a fellowship luncheon that's taking place
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.400]   at 1245 in the youth group.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.520]   So right after the service across the hall,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.680]   again, if you are 50 and over, that fellowship is for you.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   So please go to that.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.040]   And even if you haven't signed up,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.540]   you're welcome to come and join us.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.080]   So please see us over there after at 1245.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.880]   Child Safety Training Class.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.800]   So if you are working or volunteering with the children,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.440]   our church requires that you get some training, safety
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.640]   training for that.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.960]   And so if you haven't had one or you need to get a refresher,
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.360]   on October 1 at 1 PM in the youth room,
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.080]   there will be Child Safety Training Class
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.920]   that's taking place.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.000]   So please sign up for that if you need to do that.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.560]   Our next membership class is happening on October 1
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   as well, eight-week course from 9 to 1020.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.840]   So if you need to take that class, again,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.400]   please sign up for that.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.720]   All right.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.480]   Two more, OK?
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.320]   There's a Church Cleaning and Maintenance Day.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.840]   So there's a lot of stuff that needs attention in the church.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.120]   Even though we have cleaning on a weekly basis,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.760]   there's a lot of things that kind of pile up.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.280]   And there's some things like maintenance things
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.480]   that we need to get to.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.720]   So we're having an all-church Cleaning and Maintenance Day
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.800]   Saturday, October 7, October 7, from 9 to 12 o'clock.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.000]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.080]   Because there's so much traffic in the church now,
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.040]   there's a lot of things that we need to cover.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.960]   So the more of you who can volunteer,
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.200]   we can use all the help.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.360]   So please sign up for that.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.000]   It's taking place on Saturday, October 7.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.360]   And then lastly, Thanksgiving regional dinner.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.280]   Our church-- we're going to take sign-ups for that as we get
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.520]   closer to the date.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.120]   And we're going to divvy up our church members
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.280]   into different homes across the city.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.520]   But we need volunteers to open up your home.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.440]   So if you're willing to open up your home, just to open up,
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.800]   you don't need to do anything other than open up your home.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.160]   And if you're willing to do that, please sign up.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.640]   And we need more homes that we can kind of adjust
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.120]   the community to spread out on that.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.280]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.720]   That's in November 19.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.040]   Then today is the last day to sign up for the BBA.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.160]   So whatever age bracket you're in,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.040]   if you want to play half court, if you
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.320]   want to play full court, the ladies basketball.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.880]   So that takes place on Sundays, starting from October 1.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.760]   So keep that in mind.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.720]   And it's at nighttime.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.560]   So it's at 4 or 5 o'clock at night.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.800]   So it won't coincide with other events that
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.840]   are taking place at church.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.320]   All right.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:43.880]   That's it.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.580]   That's all the announcement that I have.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.720]   If we can-- let me pray for us.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   And then, again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.760]   there's a physical box on the way out.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.360]   But otherwise, we'll give you a minute to give your offerings.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.240]   All right, let's pray.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:04.080]   Father, we thank you so much for calling us here to worship,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.840]   to bring us together, Lord God, to corporately--
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.280]   to fix our attention on Christ and his word.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   I pray that in our singing, our giving, our fellowship,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.640]   all of it, Lord God, will be a pleasing aroma to you.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.560]   I pray that you would bless this offering.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.640]   Help us, Lord God, to give it intentionally
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.280]   with a cheerful heart.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.720]   And may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.520]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.760]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.260]   Amen.

[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.860]   Church family, why don't we all stand together
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.180]   as we come before our God?
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.540]   And maybe some of you saw I introduced this new song
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.980]   online for you guys.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.060]   Maybe you listened to it.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.260]   Hopefully you did.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.860]   What we wanted to do is go through the lyrics with you.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.180]   Every new song that we introduce,
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.940]   we want to be mindful of what we bring before God.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.580]   So if you follow along with me, it says,
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.980]   "Holy, holy is the Son of God.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.020]   None can stand before His majesty.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.540]   Beautiful beyond our highest thought.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.820]   Worthy, He is worthy.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.780]   Holy, holy is the Word made flesh.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.940]   King who bore our pain and poverty.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.620]   Come to claim the rebel and the wretch.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.780]   Worthy, He is worthy."
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.020]   And the chorus goes, "All glory and honor, all power
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.180]   and praise.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.820]   Be to your name, be to your name.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.380]   For no one can rival your glory and fame.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.180]   We lift high the name of Jesus."
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.300]   So as we sing the song, I hope and pray
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.180]   that we come with the acknowledgment of He is worthy.

[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:40.140]   All right, so somebody told me that we have many more in line,
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:47.140]   but they are just--we just had another baby this week,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.140]   and then there's more coming.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.140]   And so we have--the parents were up here.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.140]   Before they get started introducing their children,
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   in Proverbs 22, verse 6, it says,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.140]   "Train up a child in the way he should go.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.140]   Even when he is old, he will not depart from it."
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   There's a difference between proverb and promise.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   Oftentimes, they'll read the proverb and say,
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.140]   "Hey, we've done this, and it didn't turn out the way it says."
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.140]   Proverbs is basically general truth and advice of life.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   And so these are the things that God has ordained,
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.140]   that parents are to raise up their children in a godly way,
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.140]   and everything that they learn is going to benefit them
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.140]   as in due time, it's going to bear fruit.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   But not necessarily is a promise that if you do A, B,
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.140]   it's exactly going to happen.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.140]   The promise is when God says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.140]   and all these things shall be added unto you," that's a promise.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.140]   What we read here is a proverb, proverb meaning that this is
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.140]   a general truth in life that God has ordained
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.140]   that the discipleship happens at home, right?
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   The gospel is shared at home first, right?
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.140]   They learn at church, they learn it with friends,
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   but first and foremost, God has ordained that the raising up
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.140]   of the children happens with the mothers and with the fathers,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.140]   and that everything that they input into their children
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.140]   that they do in word and deed, even though you may not see
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.140]   a fruit right away, that long-term, everything that they learn
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.140]   at home is going to somehow affect them in the future.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.140]   And so we're going to open it up, and we're going to have
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.140]   the dads introduce their babies to us.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.140]   We'll start from the right.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.140]   Hi, everyone.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.140]   My name is Ryan.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   This is my wife, Kate.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.140]   This is our first son.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   His name is Ezra.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.140]   He's almost 2 years old, and he's been dedicated already,
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.140]   so this is not for him.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.140]   So this is Selah, Selah Chang.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.140]   It's derived from the Hebrew word "selah,"
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   which we find in the Psalms, and it means something like "pause"
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.140]   and "praise God."
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:48.140]   So that's why we wanted to name her Selah,
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.140]   hoping that she would become a woman who will pause, stop,
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.140]   and praise and worship the Lord.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:01.140]   [applause]
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.140]   Hello.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.140]   My name is Michael.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   This is my wife, Carmen.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:12.140]   We have two other kids, Adelyn and Lucas, 11 and 9,
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:17.140]   and this one is Micah Titus Chang.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.140]   As you can probably tell, it wasn't planned,
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   but God had other plans, and that's really awesome.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   So we named him Micah because it sort of sounds like both of our names,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   but with Carmen's name sounding like how you would say it with a
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   Cantonese accent, "common."
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.140]   So, you know, it worked out.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:51.140]   But it does mean who is like the Lord.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:58.140]   So we just pray that he will know the Lord at an early age,
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:09.140]   and we pray and ask the church to pray for us that we do not treat Micah
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:14.140]   as our idol, but that first and foremost that God is our center,
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:21.140]   and that we continue to worship and love the Lord,
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   and that our kids will see that.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.140]   So thank you.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:32.140]   [applause]
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.140]   Hi.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.140]   My name is Joe.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   This is my wife, Jane.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.140]   This is our daughter, Chua, Jacqueline Chua Shin.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.140]   Her name means God's child.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:45.140]   And then our son is Joshua Chua Shin, and his name --
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:49.140]   let me think about this real quick -- means as God wills.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.140]   And the actual Korean, Hanja, that his name means is actually firm
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.140]   and a pillar.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:01.140]   So I think our prayer request is simply for us as parents just to raise
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.140]   them up in a godly household.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:08.140]   Joshua was one of the few names that I could think of that didn't bother me
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.140]   as a teacher.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.140]   So I apologize if your name starts with a J.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   And then also just for our children that they may know God early,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.140]   and that they may just be a pillar of faith for the next generation.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.140]   Thank you.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:28.140]   [applause]
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.140]   Hi.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.140]   I'm Brian, and this is my wife, Priscilla.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.140]   This is our son, Aiden Elijah Choi.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.140]   Aiden means little fire, and Elijah means Yahweh is my God.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.140]   So we pray that he'll be passionate for God as he grows up.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:48.140]   [applause]
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.140]   Hi, everyone.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.140]   My name is Daniel.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.140]   This is my wife, Helen.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.140]   And this is our second child, William Jungwoo Poon.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:01.140]   He's almost seven months old now, and we like the fact that he was born on a
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.140]   nice-sounding date of 2/23/23.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   This compensates for his older brother who should have been born on 12/12/2020,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.140]   but God decided 12/13 was better.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.140]   He works for Google.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   [laughter]
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   So far, William seems to have a pretty friendly personality,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.140]   and he likes to smile at people around him.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.140]   So it just so happens that his middle name means "righteous friend."
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.140]   And for our prayer requests, we pray that he would continue to be friendly
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:40.140]   and show God's love to those around him, and then secondly,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:46.140]   that he would love and follow Christ in an increasingly secular culture
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.140]   that we live in.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   Thank you.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.140]   [applause]
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   Good morning, church family.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140]   My name is Fuji.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.140]   This is my wife, Rachel.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.140]   And this is our three-month-old son, Ezekiel, Russell Tang.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.140]   We chose the name Ezekiel because we admire the character,
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:11.140]   the prophet in the Bible, Ezekiel, and how he boldly proclaimed the gospel.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:18.140]   And so our desire for him is to know the Lord and also to boldly proclaim
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.140]   in this dark generation.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.140]   Please also pray for us as first-time parents to have wisdom,
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.140]   but also to keep Christ at the center of our family.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140]   Thank you.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:33.140]   [applause]
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.140]   Good morning, church family.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.140]   My name is Teddy.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:39.140]   This is my wife, Sarah, and this is our three-month-old Corbin Everidge-Shea.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.140]   Corbin's name comes from the Hebrew word korban,
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.140]   which means "gift" or "offering devoted to God."
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.140]   And essentially, those offerings are meant to bring one's relationship
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.140]   closer to God.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:55.140]   And this is a reminder that his life is not ultimately our own for our own
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.140]   possession, but it is ultimately God's.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.140]   And our role here is just to shepherd and disciple him to the best of our
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.140]   ability so that he may know the Lord.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:09.140]   And even now, he is reminding us that our sacrifices are of sleep,
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:14.140]   are drawing us closer to God every day, as all the other parents can attest.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.140]   [applause]
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   Hi, guys.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.140]   My name is Anthony.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.140]   This is my wife, Marsha.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.140]   We didn't sign up for this.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.140]   We just kind of walked up here.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.140]   This is our son.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   This is our son, Ezekiel, middle name Caius.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.140]   We stole the name from Fuji and Rachel's baby.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.140]   So just kidding.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.140]   When we first started thinking of names,
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.140]   I was reading through the book of Ezekiel,
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   and it was through that conviction that I also wanted to name our son Ezekiel.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.140]   So Ezekiel means God strengthens, and his middle name is Caius,
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.140]   which means rejoice.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.140]   And so if you guys could just pray for us as also first-time parents that we
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.140]   would disciple our child and that he would know the Lord.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.140]   All right.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.140]   Thank you.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.140]   You stay for a minute.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   I want to take a minute to pray.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.140]   But I also ask that as we pray for the parents and for their children,
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.140]   again, as I think all of us are in agreement that what's happening in our
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   world is becoming -- obviously it's always been secular,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.140]   but morals and the things that they're teaching are so, like,
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.140]   abhorrent to the things of God and all the more.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.140]   I mean, it's always been important that the church community,
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.140]   that we are able to raise children in a godly setting where we're like-minded
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.140]   people, like-hearted people,
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.140]   that the children are able to have a community that they're being raised up
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.140]   where even though that they don't fit in in the world,
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   but at least in the church they really feel like this is a place where they
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   can grow up together with similar mindset with parents.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.140]   And so all the more that as each one of the parents are praying that they will
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   raise up the children in a godly way,
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   that they will be a witness and come to faith early on to be a witness for
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   Christ for many, many years to come.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   Again, not just for them, but our whole church.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.140]   You know, the older I get, the more just naturally you start thinking about the
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   next generation.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.140]   Like what is the church going to be like when the older people are gone,
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.140]   when I'm not here, when our kids or grandkids are going to be the ones who are
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.140]   going to inherit, hopefully, God willing, the church.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.140]   What will the community look like then?
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   What will our grandkids, what will the church be like for these children when
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.140]   they are older and what kind of witness are they going to have?
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.140]   And all the more why it's important for us not to just think about us,
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.140]   but what we're doing and how it's going to affect them in the next generation.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.140]   So as we pray for them, I pray that you would join me in prayer for them and
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.140]   also for our community as well.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.140]   So let's pray.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.140]   Father, we thank you so much for the blessing and the joy that you've given
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:54.140]   each one of these homes, Lord God, of a new life that ultimately comes from you.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   And as they wrestle and struggle, Lord God, of being parents and raising up
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.140]   children, Lord God, who do not yet know you,
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:08.140]   I pray, Father, that your Holy Spirit and your word would truly be effective
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:13.140]   in their homes from a young age, Lord, that each one of the parents would be
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:19.140]   able to lead their children and that they would hear the gospel from home,
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.140]   Lord God, through the mother and through the father, Lord, before anywhere else.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:30.140]   And we truly ask, Lord God, as you warned us, as wickedness grows stronger,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.140]   Lord God, that the love of most will grow cold.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   And we pray, Father God, as we see the wickedness,
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:41.140]   we see the decline of morality around us, that especially now, Father God,
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.140]   for us and for the next generation, that you would be enough,
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:50.140]   that we would be able to say that me and my household,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:55.140]   that we will serve the Lord and that that decision would carry forth, Lord God,
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.140]   to the next generation as well.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.140]   So we lift them up asking for your grace and your blessing and the strength that
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.140]   they need, Lord God, to raise godly children for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   All right, let's let them go with a round of applause for all of them, okay?
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:18.140]   [Applause]
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 6, verse 17 through 19.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.140]   Luke chapter 6, verse 17 through 19.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.140]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   "Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.140]   and there was a large crowd of his disciples and a great throng of people
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:42.140]   from all of Judea and Samaria and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:49.140]   and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.140]   And all the people who were trying to touch him for power was coming from him
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.140]   and healing them all."
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.140]   Lord, I pray for guidance.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.140]   I pray for your Holy Spirit to illuminate and teach us your heart and your mind
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   this morning.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.140]   You know, those of you who are semi-new to our church,
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:14.140]   when you were coming to church you probably examined to see if this is a church
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.140]   that you want to commit to.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.140]   And typically when people are looking for a church, you know,
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.140]   there's three things that you look for.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:26.140]   And maybe some of you may be slightly different, but one is what do they teach?
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   Are they Presbyterian?
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.140]   Are they Baptist?
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:32.140]   What is the content of our teaching?
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.140]   Who's their leader?
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   Who's their leadership?
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.140]   And so where do they come from?
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   What seminary do they go to?
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.140]   And then third, you look at who's here.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.140]   So you look at the pictures to see, like, is this a place I'm going to feel
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.140]   comfortable in the community?
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.140]   And typically, I mean, you have a children's program and missions program
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.140]   and various things, but I would say a majority of the people,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.140]   those three things are probably what causes people to make a decision that,
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.140]   I think I'm going to feel comfortable here, or this is where I want to belong.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.140]   This is a community that I want to be a part of.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:07.140]   Now, all that is important because it will kind of dictate to you whether
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.140]   you're going to fit or whether you're going to learn, whether you're going to grow.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:16.140]   Now, again, I say all of that as an introduction because in verse 17 to 19,
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:21.140]   it kind of outlines for us, it introduces for us Jesus' ministry.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.140]   Who's there?
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   Typically, when we're studying the Bible, we have to find out the context.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.140]   So if I said something, and if you don't know who I'm talking to and why,
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:36.140]   what is the problem, what is the circumstance, and what's my goal,
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.140]   you're going to take what I say out of context, and that happens in the news
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.140]   all the time.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.140]   It happens with politicians, and you want to twist the words that somebody said
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.140]   to make it fit your narrative, and you can do that.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:51.140]   But if you want to accurately understand what is being said and why certain things
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.140]   are being done, you have to know the context.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:59.140]   And so the context is, first and foremost, who is he speaking to?
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:03.140]   Who are the audience that he is doing this in front of?
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.140]   So when Jesus says what he says and the things that he talks about
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.140]   and the miracles that he performs, who is he trying to address?
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.140]   So helping us to understand who is there, who's coming to him,
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.140]   who are the people that he's looking at, what are they thinking,
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.140]   what are the issues that they have, will help us to understand the rest of what
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:25.140]   he is trying to do and what he's trying to say.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.140]   So that's the first part, who is coming.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.140]   And then the second, what is attracting them?
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.140]   We know who's there, but what is the goal?
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.140]   What is causing people to come to him?
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.140]   So those are the two main things that we want to look at this text.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:44.140]   And the first thing is he identifies three separate groups of people.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:49.140]   One are the apostles, which he went, and we've been talking about the apostles
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   the last maybe about two to three months, and who they were
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   and how each one of them had their different personalities.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:02.140]   But the apostles are not people that can just come and say,
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   "Hey, I'm going to be an apostle," because they were handpicked by Christ.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:09.140]   I know in some circles they use the term "apostle" just generically
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.140]   to mean the people who are sent.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.140]   And so I've seen people use that in a charismatic background,
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.140]   or I've seen people say it like, "Oh, I'm overseeing many churches,
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.140]   so I'm an apostle."
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:25.140]   But that term "apostle," though generically it means the people who are sent,
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.140]   but most of Scripture when they use the term "apostle" is referring to
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.140]   these handpicked disciples of Christ that no longer exist today.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.140]   The Word of God came through them.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.140]   There are specific miracles that happen, and they were given to us
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.140]   as a foundation to establish a church.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:44.140]   So in Ephesians 4, verse 11, it says, "And he gave some as apostles,
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors,
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.140]   and some as teachers."
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:56.140]   And so the apostles were given first to lay the foundation for the church.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   So no one can claim apostleship today.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.140]   So when Jesus comes down, he has already chosen the twelve.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   So when he says, "second to a group of people, a large crowd of disciples,"
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:10.140]   he's not referring to the twelve.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.140]   He's referring to a larger group of people outside of the twelve
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.140]   who were claiming to be believers.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:23.140]   And so they had some loyalty to him, but they were not the twelve.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.140]   These weren't people just curious.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.140]   They've already kind of thought, "Oh, that must be the Messiah."
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.140]   They probably were people who were waiting for the Messiah,
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.140]   who may have grown up in a synagogue, and when Christ came,
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:40.140]   and when they saw his powers, that they at least professed
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.140]   that he must be the Messiah.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   So that's why they're called the disciples.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:50.140]   They're not just part of the main crowd, but they are called disciples.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.140]   Now this is where we need to differentiate,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   because we typically think if they are disciples, they're saved.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.140]   They're saved.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:04.140]   But the Bible clearly tells us that not all disciples were genuinely saved.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:08.140]   We know that because the term "disciple" is used
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.140]   and oftentimes tells us that they no longer followed Christ.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:18.140]   In John chapter 6, 60, these were people who saw the miracles,
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:22.140]   they ate the miraculous bread and fish, and they were looking for Christ.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.140]   They were attached to Christ enough that wherever Jesus went,
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.140]   these are the people who wouldn't leave Jesus alone.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.140]   So after the eating, they wanted to forcefully make him king.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.140]   They follow him to the other side of the sea.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.140]   When they find Jesus, Jesus looks right through their superficial faith
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.140]   and says, "You're following me not because you know who I am.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.140]   You're following me because you ate bread and you want more."
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.140]   And so it's in that context, he says, "The only reason why I even gave you bread
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:53.140]   is so that you would understand who I am.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.140]   But all you want is the bread.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.140]   You want the gift that I can give, but you don't really want me."
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   And so in that exchange, he says some things that are difficult for them to swallow.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   And then in John 6, 66, or John chapter 6, verse 60, he says,
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.140]   "Therefore many of his disciples,"
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.140]   "many of his disciples, when they heard this,"
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.140]   this is a difficult statement,
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.140]   "who can listen to it?"
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.140]   And then verse 66 is, "As a result of this, many of his," who?
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:26.140]   "disciples withdrew and were not walking with him anymore."
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:32.140]   So not everybody who are disciples were genuine believers.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:38.140]   Not everybody who claimed to believe persevered in their faith.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:42.140]   The term "disciple" was a generic term that oftentimes the Bible uses
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.140]   for people who are coming to him.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.140]   But within that group, yes, there are genuine believers.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:52.140]   But also within that group, there are people who had superficial faith,
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.140]   who are only coming to him because they saw the miracles,
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.140]   only coming to him because they thought, "We're going to benefit.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:01.140]   If we establish him as our king, we're going to benefit."
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.140]   And so when trials came and difficulties came,
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:09.140]   many of them who only wanted the bread, only wanted the miracles,
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.140]   eventually ended up dropping out.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.140]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.140]   you know some of these people.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.140]   The Bible describes--Jesus describes four different kinds of seeds
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.140]   where he gives the seed, some fall on the ground,
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.140]   they don't understand it, so the enemy comes and snatches it away.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:34.140]   Those people are very easy to identify because they'll openly say,
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.140]   "I don't believe. The church is not for me."
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.140]   They may have heard the gospel and they have willfully
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.140]   and publicly rejected it.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.140]   Those are easy.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.140]   The second group that falls on rocky ground,
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:49.140]   where immediately they say, "Oh, that's great. I want Jesus.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   I want to go to heaven. What do I have to do?"
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.140]   "Well, raise your hand, come to the front, we'll pray for you,
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.140]   say the sinner's prayer."
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   "Yes, I want that."
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.140]   And so they commit. They come to the church,
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.140]   but because there is no foundation, they start out great,
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.140]   eventually they fizzle out and it doesn't bear fruit.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.140]   Now, this is where the difficulty happens.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:17.140]   That second group of people in India will not last,
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:22.140]   in Afghanistan will not last, because they're tested.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.140]   It's not worth the sacrifice that they need to make.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.140]   But in a post-Christian culture where you and I live,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:33.140]   that second group of people, even though they've already rejected the faith,
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.140]   they're in the church.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.140]   There's no reason to leave the church.
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.140]   I can have church without Christ.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.140]   I can have friends without Christ.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.140]   I can have community without Christ.
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.140]   I can have morality without Christ.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:52.140]   And so the focus of the second group, even though in places where
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:57.140]   the circumstance is going to force you to make a decision to leave,
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.140]   in our culture, there's no reason to leave.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.140]   You don't want to reject friends.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.140]   Your parents are Christian. Your brother's Christian.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.140]   Your closest friends are Christian.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   So even though in every way you are no longer following Christ,
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.140]   you're still at church, part of the community.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:15.140]   And this is where we have a lot of problem, right?
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.140]   Because there's a large group of people in the church who have willfully
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:24.140]   rejected Christ but are still at church,
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:28.140]   but willfully rejected Christ and are Sunday school teachers.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:35.140]   And sad to say, could be willfully rejecting Christ and be in leadership.
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:38.140]   If you've been in church long enough, you've probably seen some of them.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:44.140]   The third group of people are people, it says, where it falls on thorny soils.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.140]   And they actually bear fruit. They endure.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   And these are the people who may rise up and people say,
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.140]   "That guy for sure was a Christian."
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:56.140]   But he says, "Because of the difficulties in life and temptations of riches,
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.140]   their life gets choked out."
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:05.140]   And so on the surface, they have all the product that a Christian would look--
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.140]   you would want to see, but there's no fruit.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:12.140]   When you actually go there to get some fruit, there's no fruit in it
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:15.140]   because the thorns have choked them out.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.140]   So there's no fruit.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.140]   And that group of people is even harder to tell
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.140]   because they go to church, they're committed to church.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.140]   They may be giving.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.140]   They may be small group leaders.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.140]   They may be worship leaders.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.140]   But at the core of who they are, they never bear any fruit.
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.140]   And if you ask them, "Have you ever shared the gospel with anybody?"
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.140]   Never. Never.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:40.140]   Even though we sing songs about Christ and his love and joy
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.140]   and hell and eternity and heaven,
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.140]   sharing the gospel is just not there.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:48.140]   And I'm not saying that every genuine Christian has to have experience
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.140]   of doing this or that. I'm not saying that.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.140]   But there's no drive for them.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.140]   There's no drive for them to, "I have to bear fruit. I need to bear fruit."
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.140]   That's the third group.
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.140]   And then he describes the fourth group, "It falls on the soil,
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:04.140]   and then it grows and bears 30, 60, 100 fold."
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.140]   So in this crowd who say that they're disciples of Christ,
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:13.140]   there are many who are not following Christ.
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:18.140]   Now, let me give you a very simple definition of a follower of Christ.
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:24.140]   And if you want to disagree with me, keep it to yourself.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.140]   But if you disagree with me, I think you will all agree with me.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:35.140]   If you want to say you're a follower of Christ, what do you need to do?
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:39.140]   You need to follow Christ.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   You need to follow Christ.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:46.140]   You can't say you're a follower of Christ while you're not following Christ.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.140]   You can't say, "I'm a follower of Jesus Christ, but Jesus is over there."
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.140]   It's like, "Yeah, he's over there. I'm here."
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.140]   It's like, "Now he's going over there."
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.140]   It's like, "Wow, he's going over there, but I'm not interested in that.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.140]   This is where I want to be."
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:07.140]   So a simple definition of a follower of Christ is one who follows Christ.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:14.140]   In any other culture, it is a given.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:18.140]   In any other culture, it was just, "Of course. Why would you even have it defined?
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.140]   That's what a follower means."
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:25.140]   But only in a post-Christian culture, where you have people who were raised in the church,
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:29.140]   made decisions, raised hands, and got involved in church, and did all this stuff and activity,
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.140]   and they're not following Christ.
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:35.140]   But if you say, "I don't know if you're a follower of Christ, how dare you question me,
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:39.140]   you judgmental legalist?"
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:43.140]   But a simple definition of a follower of Christ is someone who follows Christ.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.140]   So this large crowd of his disciples, are they genuine followers of Christ?
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.140]   Yeah, they followed him as long as he was feeding them.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.140]   They followed him as long as he was healing them.
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.140]   But as he started heading toward the cross, they stopped following him.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.140]   And they no longer, it says, followed him.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:04.140]   And as a result of that, they were no longer followers of Christ.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.140]   That's the second group.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.140]   The third group of people, it says, "Great throng of people."
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:16.140]   And there's a reason why Luke separates the large crowd of disciples versus the great throng of people.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.140]   He didn't just say, "Here's a bunch of people together."
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:25.140]   He said, "Here's one group of people who are called disciples, and many of them aren't going to persevere,
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:28.140]   and then here's a great throng of just crowds that are coming."
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:35.140]   It's interesting because when he describes a crowd, he says they came from Judea, Jerusalem, Tyre, and Sidon.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   Now, when we just read that in English and not knowing the context of that, you may just say,
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.140]   "Oh, he's just mentioning some cities."
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:46.140]   Well, Judea was like a county. It was a region where Jerusalem belonged.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:50.140]   So it's like saying these people came from Orange County, Irvine.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.140]   Orange County is the region, and in that region is specifically targeting Irvine.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.140]   Now, why would they say that?
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:00.140]   If I said, "A bunch of people came from L.A. from Beverly Hills."
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   I don't know if that's still, you know, when we were younger, Beverly Hills was like where all the rich people lived.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.140]   I don't know if that's where they live now.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:12.140]   But if I said, "They came from L.A., Beverly Hills," you know exactly what I'm talking about, right?
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:16.140]   I'm saying that they came from that region, but a bunch of rich people are there.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:22.140]   If I said, you know, "L.A. County," and I said some other city that's not known for that, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:30.140]   So when they say Judea, Jerusalem, it means that that was the epicenter of Judaism.
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.140]   And then when they say Jerusalem, Jerusalem was where the temple was,
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:39.140]   where the good Jews went and made pilgrimages there to make sacrifices, you know, for annually.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:45.140]   So what he's saying is people from all the region where the Jews were committed,
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:49.140]   the Pharisees and the leaders of Israel who were committed Jews were also coming.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.140]   And then he mentions Tyre and Sidon.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   Tyre and Sidon is in the other side.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.140]   This is Galilee. Jerusalem's down here. Tyre and Sidon's way up here.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:03.140]   And the reason why he mentions Tyre and Sidon is because that area is known to be filled with Gentiles.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:09.140]   So when he says that this large crowd of people were coming, that people who were committed Jews
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:17.140]   and people who were Gentiles were all coming together because they saw what was happening and they wanted to be.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:21.140]   So he's describing a very broad group of people that were coming to him.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   But he distinguishes between this large crowd and the people who call themselves disciples.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:33.140]   Because in this crowd, there are many who are what we would modern day call looky-loos, right?
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   So looky-loos, I don't know if you guys still, you guys know what looky-loos is?
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:43.140]   Is this outdated? All the Jubilee people know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   Looky-loos in the real estate context are talking about people who have no interest in really buying a house.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:55.140]   They got exactly $15.40 in their bank account, so they don't have a down payment for the house.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.140]   But they love looking at houses. So when the real estate agents have an open house,
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:05.140]   you have a bunch of looky-loos who don't have, you know, maybe their credit score is 450,
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.140]   and there's no way that they're going to get a loan. But they just enjoy going to houses,
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:13.140]   eating the free snacks, you know, and talking to people. They're just outgoing people.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.140]   They just like to live. If one day, maybe I can afford this.
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:21.140]   And so it's understood that if you do an open house, you know, 90% of them are looky-loos.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.140]   They're not serious buyers. So one of the first things that they do is they want to see,
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:31.140]   did you come with an approved loan, right? Are you a looky-loos or are you somebody serious?
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:36.140]   So you have looky-loos are people who are just kind of, "Something's happening over there," right?
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:40.140]   You're just sticking your neck out because you're just curious. You have no intention to buy,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:44.140]   but if something's happening, I don't want to miss out. You know, I heard they give you free food,
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:49.140]   free health care. You know what I mean? That something's happening, right?
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:55.140]   Now, you know what I noticed is when our church was small, we didn't have a lot of looky-loos, right?
[00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   Because we're just small. People, they stand out like a sore thumb.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:05.140]   When you come to a small church and you have, you know, if you have 30 people,
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.140]   29 people are going to be asking you, "How are you? What do you do?" You know?
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.140]   And so, but as the church gets bigger, more and more people are saying, "What's happening?
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:18.140]   Something's happening over there." I, actually as our church grew, we started getting people
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.140]   who are very like bold and we would ask them like, "Oh, what brought you here?"
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.140]   And they said, "I'm looking for a wife." They straight up said, "I heard you guys are a lot of young,
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:30.140]   single people. I'm looking for a wife. I'm looking for a husband," right?
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   And my initial response is, "Oh, this guy's really honest."
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:42.140]   And then the second response is, "Watch out for that guy," right?
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:46.140]   But more and more, when you have a large crowd, it feels like something is happening.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:50.140]   It attracts a bunch of people for various reasons. Now, in this group, there might be people
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.140]   who hear the gospel and then they end up coming, you know, and becoming disciples
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   and then followers of Christ, right? But also in this group are a lot of people
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:03.140]   who are coming for relationships. They're coming to sense of belonging.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   They're coming because out of habit. They're coming out of superstition.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:11.140]   That you grew up in the church and that if you don't go to church, God's not going to bless your marriage.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.140]   God's not going to bless your, you know, your children. And so, for superstitious reasons.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:21.140]   Or maybe there's some benefit of coming here because you're able to participate in sports
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:27.140]   and participate in this and that. And this group has a mixture of all of them.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:35.140]   Jesus says of that group, He would not give Himself to them because He knew what was in them.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:43.140]   Even though He attracted multitudes, He never did anything to keep the multitudes.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:48.140]   He made sure that the multitudes, when they came, that they heard the truth.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   And when He said, "Not everybody who calls Me, 'Lord, Lord, child,' into the kingdom of heaven,"
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:56.140]   He was talking to these groups. He wanted to make sure because His desire was not to attract the crowd.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   His desire wasn't simply to get the largest crowd possible to go to Jerusalem.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   He was seeking for true believers, true followers of Christ.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.140]   Now, true followers of Christ come through the crowds.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.140]   True followers of Christ eventually make a profession.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:17.140]   And then true followers of Christ eventually will persevere in their faith.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:23.140]   Jesus' ministry was gaining a larger and larger and larger crowd.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:30.140]   And you'll see as we chronicle Jesus' ministry, as the crowds become larger and larger,
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:34.140]   Jesus' message becomes harsher and harsher.
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:39.140]   Because He knows that many of them are coming to Him for the wrong reason.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:44.140]   And He knows that when it is time for Him to go to the cross,
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:48.140]   that many of them who followed Him and wanted to forcefully make Him king
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:52.140]   are going to be the same ones who reject Him.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.140]   Because they came for the gift.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:03:00.140]   They came that maybe if they follow Jesus, that He's going to bless us.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:06.140]   And it is to them that He says, "I am the way. I am the truth. I am the life.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.140]   Nobody comes through the Father except through Me."
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.140]   The reason why He's saying that is because they're coming to Him.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.140]   That they're hoping that through Him that they will be fed.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.140]   That through Him that they'll be healed.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.140]   That through Him that their family's going to be okay.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   But He says, "No, I am."
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:27.140]   The only reason why I am even doing any of these things is so that you would understand that I am.
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.140]   And so, these are the people who are coming.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.140]   And what drew Him is also interesting.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.140]   Because we would naturally think that all these people are coming from all over.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:44.140]   Even the leaders of Israel were coming because they heard that He's opening the blind man's eyes.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.140]   He's walking on water.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:52.140]   He had all the signs of what a Messiah is going to have.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:56.140]   So you would think that the reason why they were coming is because He was performing miracles.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.140]   Which is true.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:05.140]   But the way that this text tells us is, "Who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases."
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.140]   First it mentions to heal Him. To hear Him.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.140]   Luke chapter 5, verse 15, "But the news about Him was spreading even further.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:17.140]   And large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sickness."
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   I remember years ago when we used to go out to St. Anna to pass out food.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:27.140]   Before we started doing it ourselves, I would go there and find out what other ministries are doing.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.140]   So that I could learn from them and copy that.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.140]   And maybe we could go and find another day we could go start feeding.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.140]   So as I was going there and kind of trying to help out on the side.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.140]   Figuring out, "Okay, this is what you do. This is where you get the cheapest food.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.140]   This is the kind of food we should bring, not to bring."
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:48.140]   But I started to notice that the people who were coming there to get fed,
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:53.140]   they had this cliche or this phrase that they would say underneath their breath as they were going to get fed.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   And what they would say is, "We're going to go get beans and rice in Jesus Christ."
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:03.140]   If you go to St. Anna and say that, they'll all kind of chuckle because they know.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.140]   Because they say that under their breath all the time.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   The reason why it's beans and rice is because the food isn't that great.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.140]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.140]   Because you've got to feed a large group of people with a small amount of money.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:16.140]   So the food is just going to be like, you know, things just to keep them full.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.140]   But then beans and rice is Jesus Christ.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.140]   In other words, if we want beans and rice, we have to sit there.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:26.140]   And we have to endure through 30 minutes of preaching about Jesus Christ.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.140]   So they would roll their eyes. "Where are you going?"
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.140]   I was like, "I'm going to have beans and rice in Jesus Christ."
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.140]   It's Tuesday, so it's beans and rice in Jesus Christ.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.140]   Meaning, we're going to have to sit there and endure through this.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:40.140]   So that's why when we started, we said, "We're not going to do that.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:44.140]   We're just going to feed them, and then whoever wants to stick around and talk to us while they eat,
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:48.140]   we'll just kind of share the gospel, or just listen to them, pray for them that way."
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.140]   Because I heard them saying, "Beans and rice in Jesus Christ."
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:56.140]   You would expect that people were coming, that maybe that's what they were thinking.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.140]   Like, "Oh, you've got to endure through his teaching in order to get healed."
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   Instead, the Bible tells us that part of the main reason why they came
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.140]   was because they wanted to hear from him.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:11.140]   What he was saying was just as interesting as what he was doing.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:16.140]   So the question this morning is, "What was he saying that was attracting this crowd?"
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:24.140]   That people would come, Gentiles even, would come from all over to come hear him and to be healed.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.140]   What was the primary thing that he was saying?
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:31.140]   So there's a test this morning.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.140]   When he first showed up on the scene, what was the first thing that Jesus said to the crowd?
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.140]   Remember?
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.140]   "Repent," for what?
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:43.140]   "For the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.140]   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   The primary message that he was teaching was about the kingdom of God.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:57.140]   76 separate times he mentions that term in his message, "the kingdom of God."
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:01.140]   Everything that he said was about the kingdom of God.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.140]   Now, I'm going to go through a bunch of passages just so that you have a better grasp
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.140]   of what attracted people to him.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:18.140]   Because I think if you miss this point, you're going to miss the whole point of what salvation is.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.140]   You're going to miss the whole point of Christianity if you miss this.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.140]   Because you kind of take what he says, and it's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to heaven."
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:28.140]   But what is heaven like?
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.140]   What is heaven like? What is it about heaven? How do you get into heaven?
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   You're going to create your own imagination of heaven.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:40.140]   And I remember when I was young, I would hear stories about heaven is where all your wildest dreams come true.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:45.140]   And hell is a place where all your fears come true.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:51.140]   And so if your wildest dream is to be an NBA player, that's going to happen in heaven.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   If you're short, you're going to be tall.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.140]   If you're skinny, you're going to be muscular.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.140]   If you're poor, you're going to be rich.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:04.140]   Whatever that you couldn't do here, heaven is a place where that's going to be fulfilled.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.140]   If you don't properly understand what Jesus was saying, you're going to make an imagination
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:12.140]   of what you think it is to be a Christian.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:17.140]   Predominantly, everything that he says was about the kingdom of heaven.
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:25.140]   He started out because the Jews were going to crucify him because they didn't understand this message.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:29.140]   They were following him and they're going to reject him and stop following him
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:37.140]   because their understanding of the kingdom of God was created to accommodate their own idols in their heart.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:42.140]   So the Jesus that they wanted, the Messiah that they wanted, the kingdom of God that they wanted
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.140]   was a fulfillment of idols that they kept in their heart.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:51.140]   It's just that Jesus was the better way to get it.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:55.140]   And when Jesus began to teach, they were starting to get confused.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:09:00.140]   He says in John 18, 36, Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world."
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:04.140]   And he's saying that to them because that's exactly what they were lusting after.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.140]   They wanted to be in the place of Rome.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.140]   They wanted a superpower.
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:13.140]   They wanted to be the ones who are able to dictate to other people how they should live.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.140]   And so Jesus starts off by saying, "That's not my kingdom. My kingdom is not of this world.
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:27.140]   But as it is, my kingdom is not of this world."
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:34.140]   In other words, if I have come to fulfill what you think needs to happen, I wouldn't have raised fishermen.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.140]   I wouldn't have gotten tax collectors.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.140]   I would have raised soldiers to pick up arms, sharpen the swords, and teach them how to fight.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:45.140]   And he's saying, "My kingdom is not of this world."
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:54.140]   In Luke chapter 4, 42, "But he said to them, 'I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.'"
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:10:01.140]   In other words, his whole ministry was to teach them about the kingdom of God and then to bring the kingdom of God,
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.140]   to open the doors for the kingdom of God.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:08.140]   Luke chapter 16, 16, "The law and the prophets were proclaimed until John.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:15.140]   Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it."
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:22.140]   You notice here how he equates the gospel with the kingdom of God?
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.140]   The gospel and the kingdom of God is used interchangeably.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:30.140]   Mark chapter 1, 14-15, "Now after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee,
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:36.140]   preaching the gospel of God and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:39.140]   Repent and believe in the gospel.'"
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:45.140]   Again, the gospel and the kingdom of God is used interchangeably.
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.140]   Now, why is this so important?
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:52.140]   Because in our individualistic society, in this post-Christian culture,
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:58.140]   the gospel has been presented where if you believe in Jesus and raise your hand,
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.140]   all your penalty of sin will be wiped away.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:07.140]   And so now you can live your life until Jesus comes and all your wildest dreams will be fulfilled.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:13.140]   Again, that's a caricature of that, but there's a version of that that people have embraced.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:20.140]   That the gospel is that you individually will no longer experience pain.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.140]   There's no penalty.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.140]   When you die, you got a secure ticket into heaven.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.140]   The end.
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:34.140]   The way that the gospel is presented to us by Jesus is your entrance into the kingdom.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:39.140]   Entrance into the kingdom. Who enters the kingdom? What is the kingdom of God like?
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.140]   Who is the king of this kingdom?
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   What does the citizenship of the kingdom look like?
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:47.140]   Who is able to come in? Who is not able to come in?
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   Everything that he teaches about the gospel, the good news is that the kingdom has been opened to you.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:57.140]   And the entrance into this kingdom is by faith.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:02.140]   In Mark chapter, or John chapter 3, 3, it says, "Jesus answered and said to him,
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:09.140]   'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:14.140]   See, the benefit of being born again is the kingdom of God.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.140]   The benefit of why you need to be born again is the kingdom of God.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.140]   So if you have no interest in being part of the kingdom of God, there's no need to be born again.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:27.140]   The reason why you need to be born again is so that you can enter into the kingdom of God.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:34.140]   Now, obviously, this is being spoken to Nicodemus, who spent all his life trying to study the law and obey the law.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.140]   And he was one of the top 1% of the law keepers.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:41.140]   And Jesus is saying, "You've been climbing the wrong ladder.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:45.140]   At the end of that ladder, there is no kingdom.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:53.140]   The kingdom of God that I brought, it can only be entered by faith, by repentance."
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:13:00.140]   Acts chapter 1, 3, it says, "Appearing to them over a period of 40 days after the resurrection
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:04.140]   and speaking of things concerning," what? "the kingdom of God."
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.140]   Even after the resurrection, his message never changed.
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:17.140]   In fact, before he ascends, his disciples ask him, "Is it now that you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:22.140]   There's a reason why the disciples couldn't let go of the kingdom, because that's all he talked about.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:31.140]   Everything he said, your behavior, entrance into it, what it's like, all of it was about the kingdom of God.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.140]   Now, why is this so important?
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:41.140]   It's important because if we don't understand that the purpose of salvation and atonement is to restore the kingdom,
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:49.140]   the Bible says that when Christ atones for our sins, he removes us from the kingdom of what?
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:55.140]   Kingdom of Satan. Into what? The kingdom of his beloved son.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:00.140]   We have been slaves to sin. Now we have been slaves to righteousness.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:10.140]   So, if our understanding of salvation is a changing of our citizenship, there is a new requirement for that citizenship.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   Just like if you want to be naturalized in the United States, there's rules that you have to follow.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:23.140]   If you want to get a United States passport, you have to be at a certain time, you have to pass a certain test.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:32.140]   But when you come into the kingdom of God, there is a ruler in this kingdom. There's a king in this kingdom.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   And so, those who were under the subject of Satan, now is under the subject of a new king.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.140]   So, you have so many people who are confused.
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:51.140]   I believe in Jesus, and he's not my king.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   I profess, oh yeah, he died, and he was resurrected, and I believe that, I profess that,
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.140]   but there's no evidence of lordship in your life.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:09.140]   You cannot have Christ as your savior if Christ is not your king.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   Because that's what Jesus taught, the whole teaching of Jesus was the change of kingdom.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.140]   We have a new king, so we are his subjects.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:24.140]   We have a new set of rules, and that's why, starting from next week, we're going to get into the Beatitudes that he teaches.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:30.140]   These are what the characteristics of the people, of the new citizen of the kingdom of God looks like.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.140]   That's what he's saying. When you are born again, when you repent of the old life,
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:39.140]   and you become a citizen of the kingdom of God, this is what it looks like.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:45.140]   It goes against the principles of the old kingdom, and this is what the principles of the new kingdom looks like.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:54.140]   That's why, if you miss his teaching on the kingdom of God, and you begin to contextualize it to benefit you,
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.140]   and all of a sudden, the gospel doesn't sound the same.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:03.140]   The Jesus that you know doesn't sound the same, and the Christianity that you know doesn't sound the same.
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:08.140]   You begin to church, you begin to build a church to attract a crowd,
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.140]   but not building a church to bring people into the kingdom.
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:20.140]   Even his miracles, even his miracles were performed to teach them about the kingdom.
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.140]   In Luke chapter 10, 8 through 10, it says, "Whatever city you enter and they receive you,
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:32.140]   eat what is set before you, and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near you.'"
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:37.140]   Why are they healing them? Right? Why did Jesus feed them?
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:43.140]   Why did he raise Lazarus from the dead? Why did he open their eyes to the people who are blind?
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.140]   It's so that he can teach them the power of the kingdom.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:53.140]   He demonstrated his power over sicknesses. He demonstrated his power over demons.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:59.140]   He demonstrated power over creation, and he demonstrated his power over death.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:07.140]   So that, so that what we desire is not longer life.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.140]   What we desire isn't simply deliverance.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:15.140]   What we desire is not, "I have sick legs and I want to have healed legs."
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:20.140]   He did all of that to teach them, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:24.140]   No one comes to the Father but through me. He is the true gift."
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:31.140]   You know, when your children, you know, when your young children, I hope that's not how you are now,
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.140]   but when your young children and you ask them, "Who do you love, mommy or daddy?"
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:39.140]   And they'll say, "Mommy." Right? Or "Daddy." Right?
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.140]   But ask the next question, "Why?"
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   They'll tell you, "Mommy makes me breakfast. You know, I had a birthday and she bought me the Xbox."
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:53.140]   You know, when you get older, it's like, "Oh, you know, daddy paid for this."
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:57.140]   They'll tell you specifically what they gave you. And that's why. Right?
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:01.140]   Imagine if they're 25 years old and you say, "You like mommy or daddy?"
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:07.140]   And they say, "I like daddy." "Why?" "Because he bought me the car. Mommy didn't buy it. Daddy bought it."
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:11.140]   Or, "He got this for me. He got that for me." It's like, "Really?" Right?
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.140]   At some point you're like, "Hey, it's time to grow up." Right?
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.140]   Whatever gift that you got, you got because you have a daddy.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:21.140]   Whatever gift that you have or didn't get is because you have a loving mom.
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:26.140]   But imagine if their love never outgrew that and their love was always,
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.140]   "I love Jesus because he gave me bread."
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.140]   "I love Jesus because he made me whole."
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:38.140]   "I love Jesus because he answered my prayers and my family, you know, everything went and it was okay."
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.140]   "He helped me with this. He helped me with that."
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.140]   "I love Jesus because my business went well."
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:50.140]   Even the healing, all of it was so that they can see who Jesus is.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:56.140]   In John 20, 13, 31 it says, "Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of disciples,
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:02.140]   which are not written in the book, but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ."
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:08.140]   "All the signs were given so that you may believe that he is the Christ, the Savior, the Son of God,
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:11.140]   and that believing you may have life in his name."
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:16.140]   Also in John 2, 23, 25, "Now when he was in Jerusalem the Passover during the feast,
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:20.140]   many believed his name, observing his signs, which he was doing."
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:27.140]   All of it, all of it was to bring them to the real gift in Christ.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:30.140]   So if you come to church because of church, you come to church because of friends,
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:35.140]   you come to church because of the benefits of the church, eventually you will also leave.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.140]   I came to this church because people are so friendly.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.140]   Then eventually you're going to meet some unfriendly people at church.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:46.140]   You don't know what they're going through. They're cranky, they're having marriage problems,
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.140]   their children are giving them a headache, and all of a sudden they're not that friendly.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:54.140]   But the whole reason why you came to church is because of friendly people,
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.140]   and when they're not friendly, you will walk away.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:02.140]   Maybe you started a business and you prayed and your business is doing well,
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:07.140]   and then, "Oh, Jesus answered my prayer, and then I come to church because God's been so good to me."
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.140]   But as soon as your business fails or doesn't do well, and the economy begins to turn,
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.140]   and all of a sudden, where's Jesus?
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.140]   And if you came to Jesus because he blessed you in your business,
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:21.140]   you're going to leave when the business isn't blessed.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:27.140]   If you come to Christ because of the gift, you will leave Christ because of the gift.
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:33.140]   The whole purpose of all of this was so that they may see who Jesus is.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:38.140]   That Jesus is the gift. That he is the light. That he is the bread.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:42.140]   He is the light. He is the shepherd. He is divine.
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:52.140]   And until our faith grows and matures and understands that it is Christ that he is drawing.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:56.140]   Not only were they being healed, it says the people who had demons were being cured.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:00.140]   Now you may say, "You know what? We've never experienced that in our life,
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:04.140]   especially in a conservative church, and we're not charismatic."
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:09.140]   Every single person who came to Christ was being delivered from demons.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   You may not have been demon-possessed, but the Bible says,
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.140]   "Everyone who has not been atoned and purchased by the blood of Christ."
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:21.140]   Purchased from what? The empty way of life?
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.140]   The kingdom of darkness? The God of this age is Satan.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:33.140]   Every single person who came to Christ has been delivered from the influence of Satan.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:38.140]   All of this, every single one of us has experienced this if you are a true believer.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.140]   And all of this for what reason?
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:46.140]   That we may come to see the value of Christ himself.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:52.140]   The one who brings the kingdom. The one who created the kingdom.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:58.140]   The one who sustains the kingdom. The one who rules over this kingdom. Christ.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:03.140]   That's why, and let me finish with this, in Luke chapter 10, 17-20 it says,
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:09.140]   "The seventy returned with joy, saying, 'Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.'
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:14.140]   And they came and rejoiced." Can you imagine? These are tax collectors, these are fishermen.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:20.140]   The greatest miracle that they've ever seen was being performed by Jesus.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.140]   Now Jesus empowers them and they're doing it.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.140]   "And he said to them, 'I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:32.140]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy,
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.140]   and nothing will injure you.'"
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:42.140]   Can you imagine the excitement and the joy that they must have had experiencing that they're healing?
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:46.140]   Not only are they seeing Jesus healed, they're healing. They're casting out demons.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:52.140]   "But he warns them in verse 20, 'Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this.'"
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.140]   Man, what a cold bucket of water.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.140]   They come and it's like, "Oh man, it's fantastic. We saw demons."
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.140]   It's like, "Hey, don't rejoice over that."
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.140]   How do you not rejoice over that?
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:06.140]   You tell somebody who's sad, "Hey, be happy."
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:10.140]   Or you tell somebody who's happy, "Stop being so happy."
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.140]   Why is he saying this? Verse 20, "Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this,
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:20.140]   that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:26.140]   You see, you're rejoicing that comes from casting out demons and seeing miracles and powers.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   You're not going to experience it all the time.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:33.140]   That's all temporary. Eating bread is temporary. Healing, temporary.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:38.140]   Even if you're raised from the dead, it's temporary because you're going to die again.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:43.140]   If you anchor your joy in your life to the things that are temporary,
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:46.140]   eventually you will also walk away.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:51.140]   If you came to Jesus because of community, community is going to drive you away.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:54.140]   If you came to Jesus because of a friend, your friends are going to drive you away.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:58.140]   If you came to Jesus for a meaning and purpose,
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:01.140]   eventually when that gets confused, you will be driven away.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:08.140]   That's why the Word of God says, "All things will fade away like grass."
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:12.140]   Only the Word of God, only Christ will remain.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:18.140]   So the whole purpose of this ministry is to draw people to himself.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:23.140]   So the only true test of a Christian that really matters,
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:29.140]   only true test to see if there's true maturity and progress,
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:34.140]   is do you love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength?
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.140]   No, I see progress because I know more Bible. I see progress because I'm doing more things.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   I see more progress because I'm being disciplined.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:46.140]   All of that can be done without the love of Christ.
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:50.140]   But the goal of everything that we do in church, everything that Christ has done,
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:56.140]   everything he has preached, so that more and more when we see the love of Christ,
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:03.140]   the glory of Christ, the depth of Christ, that we would be like that farmer who sells everything
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.140]   because we recognize a treasure in Christ.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.140]   Again, I pray that that would be us.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:16.140]   With the busyness, especially church is getting big and your life is getting busy,
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:20.140]   you have multiple kids, you're already, you know, one comedian said this,
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   "What's it like having four kids?"
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:27.140]   You know, imagine you're drowning and then they throw you another baby, you know.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:31.140]   Some of you are in that situation where you're already busy and busy and then you just had another kid
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:35.140]   and you're just trying to make things and you're busy as it is and then you come to church,
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:39.140]   there's more things being added and we have to be careful that in the midst of all that.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:46.140]   Being busy is not bad, but if your busyness causes you to forget what our true treasure is,
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.140]   then you missed the whole point.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:56.140]   Christ and Christ alone must be our goal, must be our passion, must be our refuge.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.140]   And I pray that that may be the case. Let's pray.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:15.140]   Father, store in us a hungering and thirsting for righteousness that can only be satisfied in you.
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:22.140]   Lord, we are so easily entangled with the worries and concerns of civilian affairs.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:30.140]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ, the author and the finisher of our faith.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:35.140]   Help us, Lord God, to continue to learn what it means to be citizen of the kingdom,
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:40.140]   to honor and to be subjects, Lord God, that glorifies our King.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:45.140]   I pray that you would guide us and lead us and build a church, Lord God, as you desire,
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:49.140]   filled with people who will worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:56.140]   We love you, Lord. Help us, Lord God, to love you more. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.140]   [MUSIC - "HOW GREAT THE CHASM THAT LAY BETWEEN US"]
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:12.140]   Let's go to "How Great."
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:26.140]   How great the chasm that lay between us, how high the mountain I could not climb.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:39.140]   In desperation I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:52.140]   Then through the darkness your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:28:06.140]   The work is finished, the end is written, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:15.140]   Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:22.140]   What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:35.140]   The God of ages stepped down from glory to wear my sin and bear my shame.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:49.140]   The cross has spoken, I am forgiven, the King of kings calls me his own.
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:29:01.140]   Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:06.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:10.140]   Praise the one who set me free.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:13.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:16.140]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.140]   You have broken every chain.
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:28.140]   There's salvation in your name, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:39.140]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:46.140]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:58.140]   Out of the silence the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.140]   One more time.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:06.140]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:12.140]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:24.140]   Out of the silence the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:26.140]   Jesus.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:33.140]   Jesus, yours is the victory.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.140]   Oh.
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:39.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:43.140]   Praise the one who set me free.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:46.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:49.140]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:53.140]   You have broken every chain.
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:31:03.140]   There's salvation in your name, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:06.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.140]   Praise the one who set me free.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.140]   Hallelujah.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:16.140]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:20.140]   You have broken every chain.
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:30.140]   There's salvation in your name, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:37.140]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:44.140]   Lord, you are my living hope.
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:47.140]   Let's pray.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:54.140]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of his glory, blameless with great joy.
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:32:03.140]   To the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority before all time and now and forever.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.140]   Amen.
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:10.140]   God sent his son.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:15.140]   They called him Jesus.
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:20.140]   He came to love.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:25.140]   He lived for you.
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:36.140]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:44.140]   An empty grave is there to save your name.
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:55.140]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:33:06.140]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:17.140]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:28.140]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:31.140]   Amen.
