[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 15, 1 through 7.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.000]   We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.380]   ourselves.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.360]   Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.240]   For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   reproached you fell on me."
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.780]   For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.000]   endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480]   May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.600]   another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.840]   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you for the glory of God.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.520]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.800]   We thank you, Father, for the things that we are aware of and we thank you for the things
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   that are hidden that you are doing in order for all the things, Lord God, that you desire
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.760]   for us to come together, to sanctify us, to bring glory and honor to you.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.860]   We pray that your word that goes forth would not simply be for hearing, but for applying.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.660]   Give us a will, Father God, to submit to you, to desire to honor you, to delight in your
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.020]   law day and night, that we may bear fruit in season.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.820]   We ask, Lord, that your presence and your Holy Spirit would guide your word to go, to
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.980]   judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.180]   We thank you, Father Jesus, and we pray.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.260]   Amen.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.580]   Throughout the years, with just various things that we notice when people are coming in and
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.180]   out of the church, and I know some of you guys are newer than others, I think there
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.180]   is an agreement, at least if you've been in ministry for a while, like what people are
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.100]   looking for in a church.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.020]   Some people will at least choose churches based upon the sermons or the worship style,
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.200]   maybe the denomination, how it's organized, how is discipleship taking place, are there
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.420]   social justice ministries that are available, what kind of mission program do we have.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.720]   All of these things are important things, are biblical things.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.500]   But I think for the most part, whether we admit it or not, one of the most essential
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.060]   things that we look for in a church is, are there people like me in this church?
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:46.020]   Whether it is age, cultural background, obviously language, theology, how we view righteousness
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.580]   or unrighteousness, how do we do discipleship.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.800]   Not just externally, obviously there are external things that we look for, but we also look
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.140]   for internal things, spiritual things, how we measure what is good and what is bad.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.500]   But the core of the issue that we often look for, are there people like me?
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.620]   And so we tend to gravitate, especially in the church, toward communities that look like
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.140]   me, that talk like me, that think like me, that maybe live like me, maybe have similar
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140]   habits.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.820]   These may not be on the list of things that we're looking for, but innately that's what
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.960]   we do.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.500]   So even when you join a church, we have a tendency to gather around, especially in a
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.260]   church that is a larger size than more than 50, 60 people, you kind of have certain people
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.060]   like that you are friends with, certain people who are acquaintances, certain people that
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.340]   you spend a lot of time with, and some people that you consider to be running this race
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.340]   with.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.060]   And a lot of that is dependent on, how much are they like me?
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.340]   We have to admit that our churches are divided.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.420]   I remember when I was a younger pastor going through seminary, we used to have a meeting,
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.780]   because I was an EM pastor at Irvine Baptist, and then we had the EM pastor of Bethel, of
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.460]   OMC, of Young Knock, and all the bigger EMs in that area.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.340]   And we met together almost on a weekly basis.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.300]   We called ourselves the CPA, College Pastors Association.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.220]   We used to have retreats together, and so it was cute.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.780]   So we used to get together and have fellowship, and it was a great time of fellowship.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.540]   But I noticed that through the years, we were all from various denominations, Presbyterian,
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.260]   Baptist, one guy was a Methodist guy, a non-denominational, and we were all from different backgrounds.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.760]   But I remember when we were young, that was never an issue.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.700]   We would go to each other's churches and preach and cover for one another going to retreats.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.020]   But as time went by, years went by, decades go by, and each one of us have kind of gotten
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.020]   embedded into our denomination.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.140]   You're Presbyterian, a Baptist, and I remember very distinctly, I had a Presbyterian friend
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.100]   who was in the valley, and he asked me to come and preach for the retreat.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.940]   And then about a month later, I got another notice saying that their senior pastor wouldn't
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.060]   allow me to come because I was a Baptist.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.580]   And I began to see, as time went by, the older we got, the more committed we were to our
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.020]   local churches, the more separated we became.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.020]   And now it's become hard, where we're still friends, but it's very difficult for us to
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020]   do anything together.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.100]   This issue of unity, again, we could talk about it, we can discuss it and study it,
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.400]   but the application of it is very difficult.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.140]   The issue that we're talking about this morning is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.400]   Where Paul's been talking about justification by faith, by grace, but what does that look
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.680]   like in the life of a Christian?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.140]   And so he's taking this very practical issue about food.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.820]   Because at the core of our assembly, when we gather together and we haven't connected
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.520]   with our friends for a while, usually the way we connect is, "Hey, what are you doing
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.380]   next Tuesday during lunchtime?
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.200]   Are you free for dinner on Friday?"
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.100]   And so so much of our activity, our human connection, is around food.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.060]   We rarely or ever would say, "Hey, what are you doing?
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.060]   Let's connect.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.060]   This closet is empty.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.060]   Let's go in there and have a conversation."
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.620]   That doesn't happen.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.880]   It's usually around some kind of eating.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.300]   So if we want to have fellowships, say, "Hey, after church, we're going to gather together.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.300]   We're going to celebrate."
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.740]   So eating is at the core of human connection.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.740]   So even communion in the early church was a gathering of people and they actually shared
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.100]   meals with one another.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.220]   It is that the early church, they devoted themselves to the teaching and prayer and
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.940]   breaking of bread basically means that they were sharing meals together.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.100]   But imagine what it would do to the church if you couldn't eat together.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.340]   If because of what you're eating, that this group of people can't ever sit with you, it
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.700]   would automatically divide the church.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.260]   It would automatically cause people who can eat this stuff, they would go to this room
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.740]   and the people who can't eat that would naturally go to this room.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.380]   So even though it may seem like it's trivial, the issue that Paul is dealing with, with
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.580]   eating of meat and not eating of meat, it was fundamental to bring these people together.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.980]   The issue that we're, again, looking at, it was an ongoing theme all the way from chapter
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.540]   12 and it's going to continue on in chapter 15, is this practice of grace.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:28.380]   So today I've divided this section, the verses one through seven, into three principles.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.020]   Again, that Paul is adding to what we've already been talking about.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.900]   And again, even though it's not going to be expressed this way, the core teaching that
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.380]   Paul has been trying to convey is the same thing that I've been saying for the last three
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:55.420]   weeks, which is truth without grace leads to condemnation.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.260]   Practice of truth without grace leads to condemnation.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.780]   That's exactly what Paul is referring to.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.300]   So even though I may or may not mention it throughout the sermon, that's really the overarching
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.980]   theme that Paul has been talking about.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.780]   He's conveyed the truth, but this truth, practice without grace, leads to condemnation.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.180]   So there are three things that we want to look at this morning about the practice of
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.180]   grace.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.780]   Number one, the practice of grace is the practice of righteousness.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.540]   Let me say that again.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.260]   The practice of grace is the practice of righteousness.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.660]   Because typically when we think of practice of righteousness, we somehow separate these
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.660]   two things.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.660]   Like if you're, these are things that are righteous and these are things that are grace.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.340]   And we think that they are on opposite ends.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.220]   But when we examine closely, we'll see that the practice of grace is the practice of righteousness.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.420]   Romans chapter 15, one, it says, "We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.140]   failings of the weak and not to please ourselves."
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.860]   He's making it crystal clear, just in case you had any misunderstanding where Paul stood
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.180]   on this issue.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.660]   Paul is not dealing with an issue where you think you're right and I think we're right.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.140]   And so, well, who knows?
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.780]   This is a gray area.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.180]   He's not talking about a gray area.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.260]   We usually apply this to talk about, you know, whether it's drinking or a certain activity.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.260]   It's kind of gray.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.020]   It could be right, it could be wrong.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.460]   Paul clearly says that he is right, the weak are wrong.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:31.260]   That's why he says that we are obligated to deal with the failings of the weak, the shortcomings
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.260]   of the weak.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.920]   So Paul's desire is not, "Hey, let's just leave it alone.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.580]   Let's just kind of agree to disagree."
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.620]   That's not what Paul is saying.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.140]   Paul is crystal clear that at some point, the weak brothers need to move on and become
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.060]   strong.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.300]   Paul is not ambiguous about this.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.420]   And that's why he says to bear with the failings of the weak.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.280]   The natural question that we would have is if Paul is clear about this and he calls the
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.260]   weak brothers, their views, failure that needs to be improved, why doesn't he just call them
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.660]   out?
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.860]   Why doesn't he just say, "It bothers your conscience?
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.860]   Suck it up."
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.740]   Because that's what I would do.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.940]   Suck it up.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.180]   Because I'm right and you're wrong.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.220]   It's clear.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.420]   And I have some verses.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.580]   I have revelation from God.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.300]   Jesus actually gave Peter three separate visions.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.660]   What he declares to be clean, do not say it's unclean.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.620]   And so he has direct revelation from God.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.620]   He has teaching.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.500]   There's a movement from the old and the new covenant.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   The old things have passed.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.820]   Behold, the new things have come.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.140]   The scripture is clear where a Christian needs to stand on this issue.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.980]   And yet instead of condemning them, he says we need to bear with them, to support them,
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.180]   to encourage them.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.700]   Why does he do that?
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.100]   Now again, Paul is not dealing with an issue of the weak brother who is running after the
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.860]   world and needs to be rebuked.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.620]   He's talking about the weaker brothers who are having a hard time because either they
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:13.100]   were idol worshippers and eating of this food reminded them of their past.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.260]   And they're having a hard time disconnecting this eating of meat with idol worship or the
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.060]   faithful Jews who are obedient to the Leviticus laws of what they could and could not eat
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.100]   and they felt it was unclean.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.420]   So they were having a hard time not because they're pursuing the world, but because righteousness
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:38.140]   by faith, by justification by faith alone, alone, it was taking some time to get to that
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.340]   point.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:46.980]   That is not unlike how Christians become Christians today.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.040]   We all believe in justification by faith alone.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.460]   But to what degree do you really believe this?
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.940]   Because we all confess it.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.680]   You wouldn't be a Christian if you didn't confess it.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.340]   But to what degree does this apply?
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:07.560]   Because every single one of us, to a certain degree, and in different times it rises back
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.420]   up where we say, "Well, if I don't do quiet time, I'm not going to be loved by God."
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.060]   Or if you come to communion table and you did quiet time and you did all the righteous
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.980]   things kind of like, "Ah, I was good this week."
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.180]   And then the times that when you're not doing well, you start to drift out from the church
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.700]   and, "I don't deserve to be in the fellowship."
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.820]   These are all things that we are wrestling with in justification by faith alone.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.980]   So in various times, in various parts, in various experiences, those things come back
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.500]   at us, "To what degree do you believe in justification by faith alone?"
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.620]   And that's exactly what they were wrestling with, with this food, that that doesn't make
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.100]   you righteous or unrighteous.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.120]   So it wasn't in the context of pursuing the world, but it was in the context of them believing
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.920]   and growing in their faith, to believe that I have been made righteous by the blood of
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.940]   Christ, period.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.260]   It's not righteousness by the blood of Christ plus these works.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.620]   So in that context, Paul is saying, "Yes, stronger brothers, you are right.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.020]   They need to grow in this faith.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.500]   But how do you deal with them in that process?"
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.740]   Instead of condemning and pointing figures and saying, "Why aren't they this way?"
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.420]   Because our natural inclination is we want to be a part of the church where the work
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:32.020]   has been done, where everybody's on the same page, doing the same thing, pursuing the righteousness.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.900]   And when you come to church and you see the weakness of believers, our natural inclination
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.980]   is I want to be around people who are like me.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:48.180]   Paul is saying the church is filled with people who are even in their faith in different places.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.340]   Humanly speaking, what they could have naturally done is get the strong brothers to plant one
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.940]   church and get the weak brothers to plant another church.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.940]   Problem solved.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.440]   Now we're united, right?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.140]   We're united in our weak brother's church or we're united in our strong brother's church.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.980]   And that's typically what happens in our culture.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.540]   If we have differences of opinion, different application, then we gather our things and
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.780]   then we go, "Now we're united."
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.520]   And then after a while, maybe another problem rises and it's like, "Okay, then we gather
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.540]   our stuff, we plant another church."
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.580]   And oftentimes we dress up the real issue in the church because we think that that's
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.580]   the solution.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.620]   And Paul is speaking directly to that.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.940]   And let me give you an example of the first point.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.520]   The practice of grace is the practice of righteousness.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:43.120]   In Matthew chapter 1, 18 to 19, Joseph and Mary are betrothed to marry each other.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.220]   And during that period, if you were engaged, it was, legally speaking, it was no different
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.520]   than being married.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.720]   It was just during that period you were preparing for the ceremony.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.480]   But as far as the law was concerned, you're already married.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   It was during that period where Mary is impregnated by the Holy Spirit and Joseph finds his sound.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.440]   This is how it's described in verse 18.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.840]   "Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.120]   When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.560]   found to be with child from the Holy Spirit."
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:21.760]   So again, when he says, "Before they came together," it's just another euphemism in
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.640]   the New Testament where it's referring to they didn't have sexual relations.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.640]   Right?
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.480]   So Joseph never lied with her, and yet he found her to be pregnant.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.500]   So the natural inclination or natural thought would be she cheated on him.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.520]   She was an adulterer.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.760]   But here's what it says about Joseph in verse 19.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:46.600]   "And her husband Joseph, being a just man," another way of saying a righteous man, "and
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.160]   unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly."
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.620]   Now we would think, well, he was a just man.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.180]   He was a righteous man.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:03.160]   And Book of Leviticus clearly says that if a woman cheats, that there was capital punishment.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.320]   And yet, him being just, we would naturally think she deserves condemnation.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:17.040]   In order to save his own reputation, to save himself from shame publicly, to shame her
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.740]   publicly, "I had nothing to do with this.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.040]   She deserves to be shunned and shunned her."
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.960]   Instead, he says, because he was a righteous man, what did he do?
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.000]   He was gracious to her.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.520]   And he was going to let her go quietly, not to put her to shame.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:41.040]   See, the practice of grace is the practice of righteousness.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.680]   These are not two polar opposite things where sometimes we practice grace and sometimes
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.640]   we practice righteousness.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.520]   But in the new covenant, the practice of grace is the practice of righteousness.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.560]   Secondly, the practice of grace is other-centered.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.800]   It's not about us.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.440]   It's about what God does through us.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.280]   In verse 1 and 2, it says, "We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.680]   of the weak and not to please ourselves."
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.120]   It's not about us.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.400]   "Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.680]   For Christ did not please himself."
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.840]   You ever think about Timothy?
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.640]   Timothy was the next generation pastor that Paul was going to pass the baton to.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.480]   But humanly speaking, Timothy was not a good pastor.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   Humanly speaking.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.500]   And the reason why is because you can see it in Paul's letter, the encouragement that
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.600]   he's giving Timothy, that Timothy was timid.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.240]   He was afraid because there was a lot of opposition to Timothy.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   False prophets who are more educated, who are maybe more talented, older than him, were
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.640]   opposing the essence of the gospel.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.000]   So he's basically equipping him to stand up for himself or stand up for the truth, but
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   he's timid.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.760]   That's why in his last letter, Paul tells Timothy, "God did not give us the spirit of
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.960]   Timothy, but a power to preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   And he was sickly.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.040]   And he says, "To drink a little wine, to deal with the stomach problem that he had."
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.920]   So if you add all of these up, Timothy was not a charismatic leader who had many years
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:26.720]   of experience to go against these seasoned men who are opposing the truth.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.640]   What was it about Timothy that Paul felt the need to give him the baton instead of somebody
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   else?
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   Maybe somebody like Peter, you know?
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.880]   It was an older guy who kind of commanded attention, charismatic, and he was willing to die for
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   Jesus.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   Why not somebody like Peter?
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.640]   Or maybe like Apollos, who's gifted, and every time he opens his mouth, he garners a crowd
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.920]   around himself, yet he's preparing to give the baton to Timothy, who is timid, who has
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.480]   to be reminded to stand up and fight for the truth.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.280]   Well, we see a glimpse of why Paul would have done that in Philippians chapter 2, 21 to
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   22.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.760]   "They all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ."
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.920]   But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father, he has served me in the
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.520]   gospel.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.920]   The distinction between Timothy and everybody else, according to Paul, was that he genuinely
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.840]   was concerned for their interests and not his own.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:36.600]   That was the key quality of Timothy that where Paul was willing to trust himself to.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.400]   Anyone who desires to go to ministry, and again, this is not just a call for pastors
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:47.240]   or elders, this is obviously a call for every Christian, but the key quality of someone
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.520]   who wants to represent God, that he first has to die.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.920]   Because the primary thing that God desires is to declare his glory.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.480]   So if somebody standing in between wanted to touch some of that glory, it doesn't matter
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.660]   how gifted you are.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.040]   It doesn't matter how talented you are.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.600]   It doesn't matter what kind of experience you have.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.360]   It doesn't matter what kind of fruit you bear.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.520]   If you stand in the midst wanting to touch that glory, you're automatically disqualified.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.760]   So if I talk to a young guy who says, "Oh, I'm going to go into ministry," and he gives
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.680]   me all kinds of reasons of how he wants to do this for God, how he wants to do that for
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:30.280]   God, and yet he is not consumed by God's glory and the needs of the people, it doesn't matter.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.400]   In fact, he's a dangerous man, and he's immediately disqualified.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.920]   In fact, the false prophets before judgment came upon Israel is described exactly that
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.720]   way in Isaiah 56, 11.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.200]   The dogs have a mighty appetite.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.820]   They never have enough, but they are shepherds who have no understanding.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:54.560]   They have all turned to their own way, each to his own gain, one and all.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.200]   It may be in the name of Jesus.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   It may be Bible study.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   It may be leading worship.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.760]   It may be all of these things in saying that we're trying to give glory to God, but suddenly
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.080]   everything is about them.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.400]   What I can do, how much I know.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:16.120]   See, the practice of grace fundamentally is not about us.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:22.320]   It's about our brothers and sisters, to uphold them, to encourage them.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   The very reason why we were saved is because it says Christ practiced this with us.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.640]   Verse 3, "For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, 'The reproaches of those
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.960]   who reproached you fell on me.'"
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.360]   This is a direct quote from Psalm 69, a messianic passage.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:45.280]   In the context, it's talking about David, who's crying out because he was unjustly suffering.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   His enemies were coming after him because he was standing for the truth.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.000]   And that same verse in Psalm 69, Jesus uses it five separate times of his own suffering.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.140]   Meaning, the reason why he calls us to sacrifice for others is because that is at the essence
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.520]   of our salvation.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.480]   It is at the essence of everything that we do, that God did not look upon us and saw
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.400]   that we were weak.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   We had shortcomings.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.280]   We had sins.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:22.240]   And he didn't point that out and say, "Okay, now I'm going to practice righteousness."
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.960]   Because he could have easily just crushed us.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960]   "I'm done.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.360]   I'm done away with this."
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.680]   In Lamentations 3.22, and I'm reading the NIV because I believe it's closer to the literal,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   which is pretty rare.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.940]   If I'm going to read something more literal, I would usually read the NASB.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.360]   But in this instance, the NIV translated it this way.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.600]   "Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed, for his compassion never fails."
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.160]   "Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed."
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.400]   Not consumed basically means not destroyed.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:03.320]   Because God, in his righteousness, in his holiness, would have been perfectly righteous
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.000]   to crush us.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.840]   Because that's what you and I deserve.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:22.440]   When Christ came to die for our sins, we're talking about 2,000 plus years of rebellion.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.080]   Now we show up 2,000 years later and we kind of feel removed from that.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.960]   "Oh, we didn't crucify Christ."
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.580]   So we think that we started brand new.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.880]   But think of it from God's perspective.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.240]   That these people that he loved, he cherished, he called apple of his eye.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.080]   Every time he gives them a chance, it doesn't take long, sometimes even days after revival
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.040]   breaks out, they go right back to their idolatry.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.920]   And it is thousands of years of this cycle of God being gracious, restoring them, revival
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.640]   breaks out, and soon after they forget God, they become comfortable in this cycle over
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   and over again.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.960]   So by the time we're at the end of the Old Testament, if you've ever studied through
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.640]   the Old Testament, you know when you study Old Testament in pockets, it's like, "Wow,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.880]   God destroyed Jericho?
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   God destroyed this?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   God destroyed that?"
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.520]   But when you study it chronologically, by the time you get to the end of the Old Testament,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.640]   the natural response is, "How long is he going to put up with these people?"
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.720]   That's a natural response because that's exactly what I thought when I read the Old Testament
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   in bits and chunks.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.960]   And I said, "Wow, you know, like, he seems like a different God."
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.840]   But when you read it in chronological order, it's like, "Oh my gosh, how does Israel still
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.240]   exist?"
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:45.000]   So by the time Christ comes, this is God dealing with these rebellious people.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.360]   You're talking about the word "weak."
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.440]   The word "weak" would be an understatement to describe his people.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.760]   Rebellious, stiff-necked, idolatrous.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.640]   I mean, all of these would be an understatement of what God was seeing with his people.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.280]   So you think, by the time he would come, like, they ignored and they killed all the prophets,
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:12.480]   and if I send my only begotten Son, that maybe they will recognize him and worship him.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.280]   But obviously that doesn't happen.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.000]   Do you think Jesus was surprised when that happened?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.040]   Obviously not.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.760]   Because he prophesied to his disciples, "I'm going to go, and the leaders of Israel are
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760]   going to bind me.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.120]   They're going to beat me and then kill me."
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.280]   He knew that before he came.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.880]   So he didn't come and he wasn't shocked by their sin.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.320]   He wasn't surprised by their rebellion.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.720]   It was because of their rebellion, it was because of their sin, that Christ came to
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.040]   support us, encourage us, and die for us.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:53.680]   And so what he is calling us to do is what Christ did.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   Who would practice this?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.660]   If Christ was not in the picture, we would talk about loving your enemies and supporting
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.680]   people who are weak, especially when you know you are right, to be gracious.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.440]   Who would practice this?
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.160]   We can talk about that from a distance and celebrate the grace and love of God, but when
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.880]   it's our turn to practice this, who would practically practice this?
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.400]   It's a beautiful story.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.240]   If we didn't already know what Christ has done.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.800]   In John chapter 10, 11 through 16, Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.760]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.720]   He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.960]   coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them."
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.920]   He's talking about the leaders of Israel, but this applies to every Christian.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.000]   Because our natural inclination is when we're around annoying people.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.580]   When we're around people that we think are weaker than us.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.600]   They don't know as much as we do.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.540]   They're not as righteous as we are.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:04.420]   Our natural inclination is to move away from them, and it happens even within the church.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.820]   We surround ourselves with people who are like us, and so we choose a church that we
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.900]   think are like us, and then when we get into a church, we surround ourselves with friends
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.420]   who we think are like us.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.860]   They're not too righteous because they make us feel uncomfortable, and they're not too
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.860]   unrighteous because they make us feel uncomfortable.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:25.000]   So we have a tolerance level right around here, right?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.340]   And so we surround ourselves with people who are like us, even in our righteousness, because
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:36.840]   our natural inclination is to run the other direction.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.860]   Jesus says he sees the wolf coming, and he doesn't run because he's the good shepherd.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.860]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.300]   I know my own, and my own know me.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.580]   He's talking about there's a love relationship with his people.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.020]   Jesus says the Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.380]   sheep, and I have other sheep that are not of this fold.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.700]   He's talking about us.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.580]   I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice, so there will be one flock and
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.980]   one shepherd.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:15.940]   Our whole Christian faith happened and continues to happen because God saw our sins and didn't
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.940]   run and came to us instead.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.020]   He didn't see our weakness and say, "That's enough."
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.940]   He came and he supported us.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.740]   He encouraged us.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.700]   He was gracious with us, Romans 15, 4-5.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.860]   For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.860]   endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.860]   The reason why we have hope is not because you're righteous.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.740]   The reason we have hope is not because you're more disciplined or you know the Bible better.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.820]   It's because he was gracious.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.620]   He suffered unjustly on our behalf.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.180]   That's what he's referring to in Psalm 69.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:04.640]   So our hope and our encouragement and our endurance is because he took it upon himself
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.140]   to save us.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:12.940]   Part of the reason why it's hard for us to be patient with other people is because you
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:22.300]   and I, after a while, forget that we were beggars, that we are the weak.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:28.140]   That's exactly what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11-29, "Who is weak and I am not weak.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.500]   Who is made to fall and I am not indignant."
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.620]   Paul never forgot who he was.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.220]   He said the reason why he was saved is not because of his Roman citizenship, it's not
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.460]   because of his scholarship, it's not because of his family pedigree, it's not because of
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.460]   his gifting.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.100]   He said the whole reason why he was chosen was because he was the chief of sinners and
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.940]   he never forgot that.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:56.840]   And just in case he forgets, God puts a thorn on his side and causes him to beg before God.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:03.420]   He sells tents for a living, humbles this guy who came from a rich family and he's selling
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.820]   tents to preach the gospel, an apostle of Jesus Christ who's performing fantastic miracles,
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:16.580]   direct revelation from God, and in between he's selling tents to make a living.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.380]   Paul never forgot who he was.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:30.260]   Thomas Watson says this, "I distinguish between spiritually poor and poor in spirit.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:36.180]   He who is without grace is spiritually poor, but he is not poor in spirit.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.560]   He does not know his own beggary.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.180]   You know not that you are poor.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.980]   He is in the worst sense poor who has no sense of his poverty."
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:52.980]   Part of the reason why it is hard at times to be gracious to weak is because we have
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:31:00.020]   forgotten that we were weak and it is our weakness that brought the strength of Christ.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.500]   Third and finally, the practice of grace is ultimately God-glorifying.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.820]   The practice of grace is God-glorifying.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.380]   Verse 6, "That together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.380]   Jesus Christ.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:16.380]   Therefore, welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you for the glory of God."
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.400]   1 Corinthians 10.31, it says, "Whether you eat or drink, do it for the glory of God."
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.800]   Not simply to practice your freedom for your own enjoyment, but ultimately does it bring
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.900]   God the glory?
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.100]   When He comes in glory, we will also be glorified with Christ.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.980]   But as of now, we are crucified with Christ.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:41.500]   It is no longer I or you who live, but Christ living in us.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.660]   And so during this period, our whole point of existence, everything that we do is ultimately
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.460]   to bring glory to God.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:54.580]   And he says to live in grace, to bring God the glory.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:01.860]   John 17, 20-26, it's a lengthy passage, but I want to bring us to conclusion with this
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.020]   text.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:09.420]   John 17, 20-26 is called the priestly prayer.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.420]   Jesus is having this intimate moment with His Father, but He starts out by saying, "I
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.980]   am praying this not because I don't know, because I want them to hear."
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:26.060]   You ever hear somebody pray and they're praying just so that you can hear?
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.060]   I don't know.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.060]   I've heard it before.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.780]   It's like, "Why are you doing that?"
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   Pray to God.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.900]   But Jesus has this intimate moment with God, praying to God, but He says, "I'm praying
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.140]   to you not because you don't know, not because I don't know, but I want them to hear."
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.940]   So He's basically preaching to them.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.120]   Which I'm going to deal with that later, like why He does that.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.680]   Why doesn't He just say, "I want you to know this."
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.020]   Why does He come here and pray to God and say, "I want them to hear me."
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.020]   Why does He do that?
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.180]   I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.700]   Verse 20, "I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.180]   their word, that they may all be one.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.620]   Just as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.260]   may believe that you have sent me.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:20.100]   The glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.100]   are one."
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.100]   So let me stop right there.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.900]   He says the whole point of this prayer is so that they can hear that Him and the Father
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.100]   and ultimately the Holy Spirit are one, the unity that they have.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.220]   And He wants them to hear so that they could also hear and they would become one.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:43.280]   So His point is, and this is a priestly prayer, this is at the core of what He desires in
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   our salvation.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:51.480]   He said, "I want them to hear the connection I have with you and as we are united in one,
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.660]   that this may be reflected in them."
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:59.220]   So He says, "The glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.240]   one even as we are one."
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.620]   The scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of," what?
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.500]   "The glory of God."
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.580]   The whole purpose of our existence was to reflect that glory, right?
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.140]   We have become image bearers.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.980]   We were made to be image bearers of God.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.860]   But when we sin, that image was broken.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.220]   We have fallen short of that glory.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.500]   So the point of salvation is to restore that glory, right?
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.180]   You follow me to this point?
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:33.140]   So the whole point of salvation is to restore that image, that glory that we lost.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:38.380]   And so He says, "As you have given me this glory, I have given them this glory for what
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.460]   purpose?
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:45.100]   That they may be one."
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:50.900]   Because when the glory was broken, what was broken?
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:56.020]   Union with the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, and between husband and wife.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.180]   They hide from each other.
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:06.740]   Murder, theft, hatred came into their culture.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:14.140]   And when it says that sin reigned over mankind, is that this sin caused everybody to be seeking
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.340]   their own glory instead of God's glory.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:21.380]   And in doing so, it ruined mankind.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.700]   He's praying to them, praying to the Father, as you and I are one.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.820]   And then let me continue to read verse 23, it says, "I in them and you in me, that they
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.900]   may become perfectly one."
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.500]   Again, as we are one, "so that the world may know that you sent me and love them even as
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.020]   you loved me.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.380]   That the world, not just them, not just the people who hear me, but the rest of the world
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.700]   know that I am from you and they are from me."
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.540]   In other words, God's intent for salvation is the unity, right?
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:56.080]   The platform in which he wants us to declare his glory is the unity of the church that
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.220]   reflects the image of God.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:05.700]   "Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am to
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.540]   see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.540]   world.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.740]   Oh, righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you and these know
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.620]   that you have sent me.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.820]   I made known to them your name and I will continue to make it known that the love with
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.340]   which you have loved me may be in them and I in them."
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:30.380]   So the restoration of salvation is the unity, the love relationship of God the Father, Son,
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:35.460]   and the Holy Spirit may be reflected in the relationship of the children who have been
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.300]   redeemed.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:43.940]   And when that happens, the world will know that you came from the Father and that we
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.100]   belong to him.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.780]   Because when they see us, they see you.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.860]   That's what was lost at creation.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:58.340]   Koinonia was lost in creation when man fell.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:05.980]   The world may imitate this Koinonia in the home and in the workplace, in different places.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.740]   But you know, regimes, political regimes that came into power because of some sort of a
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:21.580]   coup or rebellion are always paranoid that another rebellion is going to take place.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.020]   Because that's how they came into power.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.420]   The whole world is under rebellion against God.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:34.140]   And as a result of that, there's an imitation of connection.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.860]   There's an imitation of Koinonia.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:41.740]   But until the unity of God the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit is reflected upon the
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:47.060]   church and the church reflects that to the world, there is no evangelism.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.860]   A church that's divided isn't participating in the Great Commission.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.660]   There's no fellowship in the church that is divided.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.180]   There's no unity.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.100]   There's no Bible study.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.820]   All of these things is ultimately reflect God's glory and the love that they have with
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.820]   one another.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:08.340]   If Bible study doesn't lead to greater love, it just becomes ammunition to point out other
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.460]   people's sin.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.940]   We can talk about Great Commission and we can regurgitate things that we have learned,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.940]   but that's all we're doing.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.780]   We're taking information that we have and we're just sending it over there.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.620]   But that is not witnessing.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:31.220]   Witnessing is seeing the glory of God and taking that which we have seen, that we've
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.620]   been affected by, and taking that to the world.
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:44.300]   So when we don't practice this grace and this mercy, we can become great churchgoers.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:51.460]   We can become experts in running the church, but we can never glorify God.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.700]   Let me get to the point of why he's praying this.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.100]   Why does he just not preach this?
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.260]   Because he is not simply trying to tell them.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.940]   He's trying to show them his unity.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.980]   He's not just saying, "Hey, we have this relationship with God.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.260]   I have this intimate relationship with the Father."
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.740]   He's not just telling them that.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:16.220]   He's showing them by communing with him, this is what I want them to have.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.860]   You love me and even though there are three parts and they're equally powerful, equal
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:26.460]   in glory, Christ humbles himself to do the work of a mediator.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.460]   The Holy Spirit is in the background doing the support work.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.860]   Even though his name is barely mentioned, it is clear that he is part of the triune
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.460]   God and all three of them are not competing with each other for glory.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:44.060]   They are magnified while they glorify each other in unison.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.500]   As they are doing that and he is glorified, the people will see their glory.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:56.540]   As they glorify each other, we are affected by this glory and we are saved.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.700]   That's what he wants us to take to the world.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:06.860]   So until we practice and until we recognize that practice of righteousness is the practice
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.980]   of grace, there is no evangelism.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.460]   There is no fellowship.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.460]   There is no maturing.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.700]   Everything whether we eat or drink was meant to be for his glory.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:26.660]   Colossians 1:27, "To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:32.220]   riches of glory of this mystery which is in Christ in you, the hope of glory."
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:39.220]   And this mystery of God's glory was hidden for ages in Ephesians 3, 11.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.940]   They created all things so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.780]   be known to the rulers, authorities, heavenly places.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:52.700]   This was according to eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.020]   What does God want to convey to the world through us?
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.380]   It's not a trick question.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.860]   What does he want the world to know?
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:11.020]   What message is he trying to give the world through us?
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:16.580]   It's pretty clear.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:28.140]   Revenge is for the weak, for the sinners, for the rebellious because of his love.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.260]   That's what he wants us to reflect.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:40.140]   The church is not simply a place for spiritual soldiers who got their act together, who are
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:47.340]   theological giants, talented people who've gotten A's in other parts of their life and
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.740]   are now getting A's in the church.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:59.580]   Church is a gathering of people who have no other hope but in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:03.380]   We are affected when we are young, we are affected when we are old.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.960]   Whether you are doing great, whether you are disciplined or undisciplined, the only hope
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.980]   that we have is the mercy of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:15.340]   And that's what makes us great worshipers.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:19.900]   Not because of your discipline, not because of your training, not because of your experience,
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:29.100]   not because of your fruitfulness, because we ran to the God and the only source of hope
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.500]   that any sinner has.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.940]   That's what he wants us to reflect in view of this mercy.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:42.220]   To give your lives as a living sacrifice to reflect that glory that is in the Father,
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.540]   Son, and the Holy Spirit to the world.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.500]   Let's take some time to pray again as we ask our worship team to come.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:57.980]   Again, you know, it's easy to talk about grace.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:05.940]   It's easy to celebrate, memorize, but very difficult to practice because it eats at our
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.380]   rebellion.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:14.580]   Nothing challenges our rebellion against God than to love people we don't want to love.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:20.180]   Because they encroach upon our life, what we want.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:26.020]   But nothing is more freeing than to practice what he practiced on us.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.820]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us, thinking practically, how does
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.140]   God want me to apply this in my life?
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:32.860]   Let's take some time to pray.
