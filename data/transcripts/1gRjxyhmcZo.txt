[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.500]   - All right, good morning.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.380]   Welcome to Marine Community Church.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.140]   Let me get to some announcements that we have this morning.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.900]   First of all, we have an all church retreat
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.500]   that is scheduled for August 11th through the 13th.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.220]   This is Friday through Sunday.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.780]   Every year we wrestle with whether we're gonna be having
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.540]   our all church retreat again,
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.620]   just because of the growing number of the church.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.180]   But this year, I mean, the benefit that we get
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.700]   from everybody getting together,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.860]   and it kind of helps the newer people to integrate
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.900]   and meet a lot of people all at once.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.780]   For older member who's been around
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.980]   who hasn't been able to meet your friends
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.100]   and meet the newer people at church,
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.220]   so it helps tremendously.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.500]   And obviously along with that,
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.820]   we have a dedicated time of wrestling with God's word
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.660]   through that time.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.340]   So we are going to be having that in August 11th
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.020]   through the 13th.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.700]   Our guest speaker is Pastor Carlos Chung.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.980]   And again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.300]   and I explain that a little bit later,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.540]   but we're really privileged to be able to have him come
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.280]   and join us and deliver the word of God to us.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.380]   It's going to be in Western Rancho Mirage Golf Resort and Spa.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.340]   This is the place that we had it two years ago.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.780]   And let me see.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.620]   Early bird registration is gonna start pretty soon,
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.700]   and we'll give you more information about that
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.900]   as we have a definitive date.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.660]   So we want you guys to really make an effort
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.620]   to try to come to that because it is very beneficial
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.420]   in every way to be able to all be together for that weekend.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.500]   So we'll remind you as we have more clear announcements
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   on that.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.460]   The service auction that you guys have volunteered,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.500]   the auction is gonna start today at night
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.980]   on Berean members page.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.280]   So you can go on there and all throughout this week,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.700]   you can go and bid for different stuff.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.620]   So you'll be able to see what's up there.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.500]   And then at Saturday at appointed time,
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.700]   there's gonna be a cutoff time.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.380]   So you can bid right up to that point.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.860]   And then as we mentioned before,
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.280]   all of the funds that come in through that
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.020]   is gonna be used for adoption funds.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.260]   So for families who are planning to adopt,
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.820]   and once that has happened,
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.500]   and there's a scholarship for that
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.940]   and that you can apply for.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.020]   And so all the funds that are gonna come in
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.860]   are gonna be used for that purpose.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.760]   In a few weeks, we have the Easter week that's coming up
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.180]   or Passion Week that's coming up
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.920]   starting from Palm Sunday on April 2nd.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.760]   As you guys know,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.540]   this is probably the busiest week of our church
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.760]   'cause we dedicate the whole week every single day
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.440]   until the Resurrection Sunday.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.960]   And so just a reminder to you,
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.360]   starting from Palm Sunday,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.200]   starting from Monday at night at 7.30 p.m.,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.320]   we're gonna be having devotional
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.740]   from Monday through Wednesday at 7.30.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.460]   One of our pastors are going to give
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.420]   just directions of what happened to Christ that day
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.600]   so that we can follow along
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.400]   the last week of Jesus' Passion Week.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.460]   And then there's gonna be some members of our church
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.020]   who's gonna be giving their testimony.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.660]   And so please come out for that.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.180]   And then on Thursday, we have a Passover meal
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.580]   that's gonna be taking place at 6.30 p.m.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.300]   So if you've never attended a Passover meal before,
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.660]   I highly encourage you to come and participate in this
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.860]   to be able to get a visual representation or presentation
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.900]   of what Jesus went through
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.240]   right before he went to the cross next day
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.060]   and how it was really embedded into the culture
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.480]   among the Jews to get them ready
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.020]   for what Christ was going to do.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.700]   So to be able to know the elements
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.040]   and what it signified and what it pointed to,
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.900]   if you haven't participated in it before,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.980]   I encourage you to sign up as soon as possible.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.300]   There is a limited space,
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.540]   obviously because it is actually going to be a meal.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.340]   And we don't know the exact number,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.020]   but right now we're looking at somewhere around 120 to 150.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.980]   So if you haven't participated before,
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.560]   I highly encourage you to do that.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.820]   And those of you,
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.800]   especially those of you who have young children,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.180]   it'll be a great way to teach them
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.700]   about the meaning of the cross
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.000]   and what Christ has done through the Passover meal.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.260]   So please sign up for that.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.780]   And even if you have come before
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.500]   and you wanna make this an annual tradition
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.540]   among your family, you're more than welcome to do that.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.220]   But once that number is met,
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.500]   we're gonna have to cap it because of the space.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.980]   Okay?
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.140]   Bring in membership class.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.020]   Those of you who have been waiting
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.060]   to take the membership class,
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.220]   the next session is gonna be happening on April 16th,
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.820]   and it's an eight-week course
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.140]   from 9 to 10.20 a.m. to June 4th.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.940]   Okay, so if you need to sign up for that,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.540]   please let Pastor Nate know,
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.140]   or there's a place to sign up on the app and on the webpage.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.500]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.940]   And then Pastor Nate or someone at church
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.020]   will give you information of where to meet and when to meet.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.200]   So this is a membership class.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.360]   It goes over the fundamental doctrines of our faith.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.380]   It goes over our ministry philosophy,
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.920]   why we do what we do.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.540]   And so it'd be a great time
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.720]   if you are planning to become a member
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.020]   to prepare you to know what it means
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.140]   to be a member at this church.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.140]   And so that's an eight-week course starting on April 16th.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.660]   Okay?
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.880]   I think that's it for today's announcement.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.440]   Again, if you are visiting us,
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.660]   or if you have come and brought physical offering
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.340]   to the church, there is a box in the back
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.420]   as you're going out.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.520]   But for the rest of us, we have electronic giving.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.440]   And let me pray for us,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.180]   and I'll give you a minute to do that.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.280]   All right, let's pray.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.660]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.780]   that we have to come and join together
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.300]   as saints to worship you.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.100]   Lord, we brought various burdens of our hearts,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.520]   distractions, temptations.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.120]   Some of us, Lord God, in our failings,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.160]   in need of your grace.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.600]   We pray, Father, that you would cause us to hear from you,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.500]   that we would hear you, we would obey you,

[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.100]   May this offering be given as an act of worship
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.260]   and multiply for your use in your kingdom.

[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter five.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   I'll be reading from verse 12 through 16.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.760]   Luke chapter five, verse 12 through 16.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.760]   "While he was in one of the cities,
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   "behold, there was a man covered with leprosy.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   "And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.760]   "and implored him, saying,
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.760]   "'Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.'
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   "And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying,
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   "'I am willing, be cleansed.'
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   "And immediately the leprosy left him.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   "And he ordered him to tell no one,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   "'But go and show yourself to the priests
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   "'and make an offering for your cleansing,'
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   "just as Moses commanded as a testimony to them.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.760]   "But the news about him was spreading even farther,
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   "and large crowds were gathering to hear him
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   "and to be healed of their sicknesses.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   "But Jesus himself would often slip away
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   "to wilderness and pray."
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   Let's pray.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing upon the Word.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   We pray, Father God, that those who have ears would hear,
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   that you would soften and prepare our hearts,
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.760]   Lord God, to receive it.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   May your Word accomplish what you have ordained for it,
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   that we would grow, mature, and be sanctified
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   according to your will and your purpose.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.760]   You know, last few years,
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.760]   I think our world has gone through some craziness, right?
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   And now slowly all the countries are starting to open,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.760]   people are beginning to travel again,
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   and some of the even more, the strictest countries
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   are starting to open so that people can travel.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.760]   I remember very distinctly in the beginning of it
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   where there was a lot of information that came out
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.760]   and said that this is going to be like the Spanish flu,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   that people are going to die,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   and we need to stay in, and so out of fear, we went home.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.760]   And we opened up as soon as we were able to open up,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.760]   and I remember the first week that we got back together,
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   and I don't think we were closed for that long.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   I think maybe about a month or so that we were closed,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   or maybe a little bit longer than that.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   But I remember the first crowd that came back
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   and how we all missed being together, you know?
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   And then once you tasted being together,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   you just couldn't go back.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   And I remember a couple years ago
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   when we decided to have our all-church retreat.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   A lot of people were saying that we're crazy.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   We weren't completely out of it yet,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   and so we had almost 650, 700 people
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   gather together at the hotel,
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   and we were just surprised.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   We thought there's too many people who are going to be afraid,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   and they're not comfortable being out yet,
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   but to my surprise, we had the largest attendance ever
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   for that retreat.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.760]   And I think because people really were hungry for interaction.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   They wanted to see each other,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   and just seeing each other through the video
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.760]   just was not enough, and wanted to get back to
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.760]   just rubbing shoulders and eating together.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.760]   You remember what that was like,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.760]   just being isolated, not a fear of what may happen.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   Now, you know, we have all this information that's coming out,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   and it wasn't as severe as it was first thought.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   And I don't think that--you know, there's a lot of theories going around,
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   and I don't think we'll ever completely know.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.760]   I think the years when we removed going back
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   and what information was given and why was it given,
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   what was going on, and we'll find out later.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   But I think emotionally, we can all understand
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.760]   how it feels to be isolated
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   and possibly living in fear of some disease.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   Now, all of this, I say to introduce to you
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.760]   what we're looking at this morning with leprosy.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   Leprosy was considered one of the most hideous diseases.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   In fact, oftentimes, they would have preferred death
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   over catching this disease.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.760]   The Jews actually would use--
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   used to call this disease "living death."
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   And when you look at what was required
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.760]   and what happened when this happened,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   we can understand why.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.760]   It's mentioned 58 separate times in the Bible,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   and out of that, 13 of it in the New Testament,
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   mostly as an encounter with Christ.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.760]   Now, we know that Jesus healed the blind,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.760]   raised the dead, he had people walk,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.760]   and he performed many miracles,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.760]   but there are many encounters, specifically with leprosy.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.760]   One, because it was pretty rampant,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.760]   this disease, during that first century,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   and they didn't have a cure.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.760]   And basically, if you got it, it was a death sentence.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   And you were forced to live in complete isolation.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   In fact, remember when we were studying
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   the book of Leviticus, chapter 13 and 14,
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   there's so much detailed information given
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   as to how to identify and how to restore them back.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   In fact, almost to the point where there's nothing else
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   that we can see, no disease, anything,
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   that's given this much detailed information.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   Why is that?
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   Most theologians will say, in agreement,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   that this disease of leprosy is the outer manifestation
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   of the spiritual disease in us.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   And we can see why, and I'm going to make that case
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.760]   as I'm teaching through this text,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   why this man was so desperate to be healed.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   First, Luke says that he was covered in leprosy.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   In some of your translations, it says he was filled with leprosy.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   Filled with leprosy meaning that he wasn't
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   in the beginning stage of leprosy,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   that it's taken full effect, and every part of his body
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.760]   has been affected by this disease.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.760]   Now, you've probably seen pictures
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   of someone who has leprosy, whether on Google
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   or encyclopedia, depending on what era you were born.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   However you've seen it, it's a hideous picture.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.760]   And I didn't even want to show you this picture
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.760]   because it is very difficult to look at.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   So somebody who is suffering with this disease,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   basically, their body begins to rot,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.760]   not necessarily because of the disease itself,
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   but the disease basically attacks the central nervous system,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   and after a while, you don't feel pain.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   And so what happens is, when you see the deformities
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   and the pusses and all the stuff that you know,
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   you've seen pictures of someone who has leprosy,
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   basically, it's because they don't feel pain,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   they would throw their hands in a fire,
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.760]   or they would get burned, or they would get a broken arm,
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   and they don't feel any pain. They don't know what's happened.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   So as a result, they're not able to treat it,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   and as a result of that, it would get infected
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   and basically would rot.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   So the pictures that we see of somebody who has leprosy
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   basically is somebody who's gotten injured
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   and is not able to take care of it
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.760]   and is beginning to rot.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   This disease still is around in modern era
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   in the third world countries,
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   and they said that oftentimes patients would come in
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   with this disease, and then their biggest problem
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   is they would go home, and it's a third world country,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   and because of the puss and all this stuff,
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   it would attract rats, and in the middle of the night,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.760]   the rats would come and gnaw at their flesh
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.760]   and come back to the hospital,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   basically with their fingers and toes
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   and parts of their body chewed off by the rat,
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   but they don't know it because they can't feel any pain.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.760]   So it is a hideous disease,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   and they said that oftentimes the doctors would,
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.760]   after treating and giving an ointment,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   would send them back with a cat
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   just to scare off the rats while he is sleeping.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   This is how hideous and horrible this disease is and was.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760]   And so can you imagine in the first century
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   where there's no cure for this,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   that they had to live in complete isolation?
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.760]   This is what it says about leprosy.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.760]   In Leviticus chapter 13, 45 to 46, it says,
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.760]   "As for the leper who has the infection,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   "his clothes shall be torn,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   "and the hair of his head shall be uncovered."
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   Now, why does he have to tear his clothes
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   and his head uncovered?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   Because people needed to see.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   They wanted everybody to know
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.760]   that there was a leper in their vicinity.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   So they wanted to visually show people.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   So you had to have torn clothes by law.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   You had to tear your clothes
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   just in case that they couldn't hear him,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   they can at least see him.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.760]   He said, "He shall cover his mustache and cry, 'Unclean, unclean.'"
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   So everywhere he went--
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   I mean, it's horrible enough that the physical pain, right,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   of his body just eroding,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   he had to say, "Unclean, unclean."
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   Everywhere he went, basically warning people,
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.760]   "Get away, get away. A leper is coming."
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   Verses 4 to 6, "He shall remain unclean
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   "all the days during which he has the infection."
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.760]   He is unclean. He shall live alone.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   His dwelling shall be outside the camp.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.760]   On top of the physical deformity
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   and the pus oozing and rats gnawing at this person,
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   everywhere he goes, he needed everybody around.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760]   He couldn't hide this.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   By law, he had to tell everybody, "Unclean, unclean."
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.760]   And to be put outside the camp
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   basically was understood as you were cursed by God.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   And that's exactly how they took it in the first century.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   This living death that this person had,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   he also had to be completely isolated, live by himself.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.760]   And we know to some degree what that feels like, right?
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.760]   Some of you guys, especially younger people,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.760]   used to going around everywhere.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   I mean, this isolation was miserable for you, right?
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760]   The only people who actually liked it
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   are the middle-aged parents who had younger kids
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.760]   who never come home.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   You know, we had our kids forced inside the house,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.760]   so we were able to spend time with them like never before.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   So outside of us, right,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   the majority of you were miserable, right?
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.760]   Wasn't eager to get out.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   So we all know what isolation feels like.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   He said, "But a leper had no choice. He was isolated."
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.760]   As long as he had leprosy.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   But on top of that, people saw him as a man
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   who was cursed by God. He deserved this.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   So he didn't get any sympathy.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   There was no compassion for a leper.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.760]   So you can see why this man was so desperate.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   When Jesus comes and he hears about Christ coming,
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   he bows down, begging, "Heal me."
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.760]   In fact, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   that this sin, so hideous,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   but it is directly linked to how God views sin.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   Isaiah 1, verse 5-6,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   God brings an indictment against the nation of Israel
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   for their rebellion,
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   and this is how their rebellion is described.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   "Where will you be stricken again
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   as you continue in your rebellion?
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   The whole head is sick and the whole heart is faint.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   From the soul to the foot, even to the head,
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   there is nothing sound in it,
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   only bruises, welts, and raw wounds,
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   not pressed out or bandaged nor softened with oil."
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   Basically, he describes our sins,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   and this is a description of leprosy.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   How it starts small, erodes the flesh,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   and has a tendency to ruin the community.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   Again, in 2 Timothy 2, 16-17,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   "Avoid worldly and empty chatter,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   for it will lead to further ungodliness,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   and their talk will spread like gangrene."
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   This sin, this heresy, if we don't deal with it,
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   he says, this skin disease, it will begin to spread.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   So he was desperate.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   That would be an understatement to say that he was desperate.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   The scripture says he fell on his face.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   Matthew 8-2, he says, "He knelt before him."
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   Mark 1-40, "He bowed down in desperation."
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.760]   We talked about this Friday.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.760]   I asked you to kneel when we prayed this Friday
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   because it is a posture of desperation.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   Desperately in need.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   It is a posture of humility,
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   recognizing that we are in desperate need of His mercy.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   It is a posture of devotion,
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   that this is not something that we just kind of,
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   whether he can answer or not, we're okay with it,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   but we need him to answer this.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   And so this man, seeing Christ come into town,
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   bowed down on his knees, imploring, begging Him,
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   You notice here, he doesn't question his ability.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   He questions his will.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.760]   Oftentimes in our generation, we pray to him,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   it's like, can God actually do that?
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   Can He actually change, get rid of the whole COVID?
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   Can He actually overpower whatever problems that we have?
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   This man had no issue with that.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   He said, "You are able, but are you willing?"
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   Hebrews 11, verse 6, it says,
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   "And without faith it is impossible to please Him,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   for he who comes to God must believe that He is,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him."
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   First of all, this man had no problem with this.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   He believed.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.760]   He believed that Jesus, if He was willing, He is capable.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   But his question was, will you be willing?
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:52.760]   Think about today, the way we consider grace.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   Grace has been passed out like Halloween candy,
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   to the point that people who are asking for grace,
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   in need of grace, demands it.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   How often do you hear somebody, it's like,
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   "Oh, that guy wasn't gracious to me.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   I went to that church and they don't practice grace.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   What is that?
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   Nobody reached out to me.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   Nobody looked after me.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   What kind of a church is that?"
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   Now, you probably heard this many times.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   Maybe you participated in it.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   But the very definition of grace,
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   the definition of grace nullifies your demand.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.760]   Because the definition of grace is you asking for,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.760]   begging for something that you did not earn,
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.760]   something you did not deserve.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.760]   So how can you demand grace?
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.760]   Grace is something that you're hoping for.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   Grace is something that you are pleading for.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   Grace is not something you demand.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   What did you do that you would demand
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.760]   that I be gracious to you?
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.760]   You could hope that I can give it to you.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.760]   You may wish that I give it to you,
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   but you can't demand that.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.760]   And I can't demand that of you.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   What did I do for you that I demand
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   that you be gracious to me,
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.760]   that you give me your attention?
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:21.760]   The very definition of grace humbles us.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   The very definition of grace causes us
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   to be in a situation of humility and desperateness.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.760]   You cannot demand grace.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.760]   You don't, you know, only in church
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.760]   do we even practice this.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   You don't go into Walmart and say,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.760]   "What is this?
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   I walked in here and nobody gave me a drink.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   Nobody cares about me here.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   I'm not coming here again."
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.760]   Only, no one would ever do that.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.760]   You don't walk into a Disney Land and say,
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   "Nobody gave me a free ticket.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.760]   What is this?
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   This place sucks."
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   Only at church, only at church
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   you demand grace
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   because grace has been passed out
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.760]   like Halloween candy.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.760]   And so we expect it and we demand it.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   No.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.760]   This man understood his position.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   You are capable,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   but Lord, would you be willing to heal me?
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.760]   That's the situation of every sinner.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   Every sinner who stands before God,
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.760]   you don't demand him to forgive you of your sins.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   You don't demand him to answer your prayers.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   Look what he says in Joel, Joel 2.13-14.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   "Rend your heart and not your garments.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Return to the Lord your God,
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   for He is gracious and compassionate,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness,
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   and relenting of evil."
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   But look what he says in verse 14.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760]   "Who knows whether He will not turn and relent
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.760]   and leave a blessing behind Him."
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760]   You notice how he said,
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   "Yes, God is compassionate.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   He is gracious.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   He is loving kindness.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   He is abounding.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   He is relenting of evil."
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   And if you just humble yourself
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.760]   and if you beg Him for forgiveness,
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   who knows?
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760]   Maybe God will be gracious
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   and forgive you of your sins.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.760]   But sometimes the way we approach God is like,
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.760]   "Hey, I asked for forgiveness."
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   We demand it.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   We knock on the door,
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   and if it doesn't open fast enough,
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   "Oh, He didn't open.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.760]   He didn't come running when I told Him to come."
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   I mean, it's just the arrogance of our generation
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   who expects, expects, and demands.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   "I asked you and you didn't give it to me.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   What kind of a God are you?
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   I was in need and I asked you
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   and you didn't answer.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.760]   What kind of a God are you?"
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   Every sinner who is desperate
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   is in the same position as this man.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.760]   You know, the fact that he even came to Jesus,
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   he risked everything because
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   he was supposed to stay away from people.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   He was supposed to yell, "Unclean, unclean."
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   He was supposed to tear his clothes
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.760]   so that people can see.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.760]   But the fact that he drew near to God
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   and began to cry out,
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   just for that fact alone,
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   they could have picked up the stone and stoned him.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   But he was that desperate.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   Even if he died, this is his only chance.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   This is the only person that he's ever met
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   that possibly has answer for his disease.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.760]   But look at Jesus' response.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   Instead of saying,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.760]   "Why is that guy coming near me?
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   If he contaminates you and he contaminates me,
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   I mean, we're done for."
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   He said, "How does he answer him?"
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   In Mark 1.41 it says that
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   Jesus was moved with compassion.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   He didn't simply see an unclean person.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   He didn't simply see a leper coming to him.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   He saw a man who was suffering,
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   who was in desperate need.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   And you know what's amazing about this?
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   Jesus could have just said,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   "I am willing, you're unclean."
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   He could have done that, right?
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   Sometimes, I mean, Lazarus, all he said was,
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   "Come out!"
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   But he touches him.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   Now, if we don't know the context of this,
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   it's like, oh, he touched him.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   Sometimes he touched him,
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   sometimes he just said it,
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   but there's significance of his touching,
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   because this is a leper.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   This man probably hasn't been touched for decades.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   Not by his family,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   not by his friends.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   He was outside the camp.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   He was unclean.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   Not only was he unclean,
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.760]   he would make everybody else unclean.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   So you talk about isolation.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   This man probably hasn't been touched
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   for years and years and years.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   Instead of shunning him,
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   he reaches out and touches him.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   You have to understand the significance
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   of this touch to this man.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   What that meant for this man.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   Years ago, when we were coming out of China
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   for short-term missions,
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   it was the year that they had SARS.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   So last minute, they told us
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   that we couldn't come into China,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   so we found another work for one year.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760]   We went into Romania.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   And so we spent our summer out in Romania.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Some of the people here,
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   Pastor Mark was with me at that time.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   But prior to going into Romania,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.760]   there was a documentary.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   Some of you guys may know.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   Some of you guys who are a little bit older.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   Remember the documentary that came out?
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   There was an expose piece.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   I think it was 60 minutes.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   And it was an expose on the Romanian orphanages.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   You guys remember?
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   There was a huge surge of adoption
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.760]   from Romania after that.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   So this was a few years after I saw that
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   and I came in.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   And so while we were in Romania,
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   I wanted to go visit the orphanage.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   So we took our team and went to the orphanage
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   and had a bunch of children running around.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   And when they saw us coming,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   they came and drew near.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   And their behavior was strange.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.760]   They weren't like other kids, you know, typically,
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.760]   especially for me.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.760]   You know, they're usually afraid of me
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.760]   until they see candy, right?
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   I don't have the most pleasant face.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Right?
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.760]   But they were coming, and each one of us,
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.760]   as we were sitting down,
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   and I think they might have been
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   about 10 or 11 of us.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   And we sat down and the kids would come
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.760]   and all they did was sit on our lap.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.760]   And usually, you know, young children,
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.760]   I mean, you'd have to coax them
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.760]   and play games with them
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   and chase them around.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   But all they did was they came
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   and they sat on our lap.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   They would not move.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.760]   They're not yelling.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   They're not asking for anything.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.760]   They just sat there.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   And so they were so cute.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   And we were just playing with them.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   It was just kind of strange.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   Hey, Romanian kids are really well behaved.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   That's what we thought in the beginning.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   And then the workers came
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   and they started scolding us.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   They said, "Don't do that."
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   That's why you guys wanted us to come.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   You know, you wanted us to hold them
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   and play with them.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   They said, "Don't do that."
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   And he said, "The reason why is
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.760]   we don't have enough people
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.760]   to hold them after you leave.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   And once you leave,
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   they're going to want more of it.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.760]   And because we can't give it to them,
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   it'll be hard for us."
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   So they told us not to do that.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.760]   It was heartbreaking.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   Two, three, four-year-old kids
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.760]   that you're not allowed to touch.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   Can you imagine a child growing up in that?
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   You know, years ago,
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   well, there was a period when I thought
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   Esther and I were going to go
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   into full-time homeless ministry.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   So I spent a few days out on the street
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   just to see what it's like for them.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   And I found something, I learned something
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.760]   that I would have never known
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   if I wasn't out there.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   It's not that hard to be homeless physically
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.760]   in Orange County
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   because the weather's not that bad.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   You just pretend like you're camping.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.760]   You have a nice bag,
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   and the weather's not that bad.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   In fact, there's food.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   Everybody knows where to go.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.760]   Monday night, this church is coming.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   Tuesday night, this church is coming.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.760]   Wednesday morning, you can go to this Catholic center,
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   and they have a shower,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   they have fresh clothes
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   that if you want to change,
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   dental work.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   And if it gets too cold,
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   there's a center,
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   there's a church out there
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   that has a large gym,
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   and they open up,
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   and they come pick you up if it rains.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   But for the most part,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.760]   probably about 95% of the year,
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   it's not that hard being out on the street.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   In fact, I've seen many people gain weight out there
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   because there's almost competition.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   There's so many churches
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   that want to come out there and feed them.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   It was almost a competition.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   So I asked them,
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.760]   "What's the hardest part of being homeless?"
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   I said, "Do people yell at you and curse at you,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   "and they don't want you
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   "and chase you out of stores and stuff?"
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.760]   He's like, "No.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.760]   "For the most part, they just leave us alone."
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   He said, "So what's the hardest part?"
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   He said, "The hardest part is not mattering."
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.760]   People don't yell at us.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   They don't shoot us.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   They don't throw things at us.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   They don't curse at us.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   But when they see us in front of the store
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   or sitting somewhere,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   they just walk around.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   They try really hard not to make eye contact.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   The thought of insignificance,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   that if they ever died out there,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   no one would look for them.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   No one would hurt for them.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   He said, "That's the hardest part," they said.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.760]   Insignificance.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   The leper knew this to the nth degree.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   He couldn't be around people.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   He couldn't go to the temple.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.760]   He couldn't associate with others.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   And he had to constantly tell people,
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   "I'm coming, I'm coming,"
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   just so that he can be left alone.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   Jesus touching him
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   wasn't just a physical compassion
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   because any other man that touched him
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   would have become unclean.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   And if he became unclean,
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   everybody he was around would also be unclean.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   But only the touch of Christ
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   reversed his curse.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   Only Christ's hand, any other hand,
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   he would have transferred his uncleanness
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   to that man.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   But only Christ's touch
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   reverses the curse on his body.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   Jesus also says in John chapter 6,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.760]   "If you do not drink of my blood
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   and eat of my flesh,"
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   there is no relationship with us.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   That is the most sacrilegious thing
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   a Jew could have done,
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   drink the blood of a human being.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   And yet he uses that to tell them,
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   obviously he's referring to the atonement on the cross,
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   that only the blood of Christ
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.760]   can reverse man's curse.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   Every single one of us
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   is born a sinner
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   and then we continue to sin.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   We've been sinned against
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   and as a result of that we also sin.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   So if you've experienced abuse,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   the tendency is for you to abuse.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   If you've been hurt,
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   the tendency is that you end up hurting.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   So we become unclean.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   We are born unclean,
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   we experience uncleanness
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.760]   and then we spread the uncleanness.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   That's the curse of mankind.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   That's when the Bible says that sin reigns in mankind.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   That's what it means.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   We're born into uncleanness
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   and then this uncleanness begins to spread
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   to everybody around us
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   and only Christ comes into this curse of mankind
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   and it says in 2 Corinthians 5.20,
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   "He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   so that we might become the righteousness of God."
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   Only Christ absorbed our uncleanness upon Himself
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.760]   and in His resurrection reverses this curse.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   So we no longer say,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.760]   "I hurt because I've been hurt.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   I abused because I've been abused."
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   We can no longer say that.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   We say, "I love because He first loved me.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   Because He cleansed me.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   Because He touched me."
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   A child of God is a child of God
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   because you've been touched by Christ
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.760]   and He took away your shame
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   and He reversed your curse.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.760]   That's the touch of Christ.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   Not only was it for Him
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   but the others needed to see.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   The others needed to see that He made him clean.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   That this man is whole.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   That they can also touch Him.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   He gets up.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   Leprosy immediately leaves Him
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   and He commands Him two things.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   One, don't tell anybody.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.760]   Just like He told the demons.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   Just like He told everybody else.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   And the reason why is because
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   if His fame begins to spread,
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   people are going to want to forcefully make Him king.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.760]   And so He was trying to keep it under wraps
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   and He says, "Don't tell anybody."
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   But secondly, He tells them,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   "Go show yourself to the priests."
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   He tells them to go show themselves to the priests
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   because He needed to be confirmed
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   in order to get back into society.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   You notice, He asks,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   "If you will, you can make me," what?
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   "Clean."
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   Not get rid of the disease.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   He says, "Clean."
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   Because that was the primary suffering of a leper.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   His uncleanness.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.760]   So that he can get back into society.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.760]   So that he can feel the human touch.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   To come in from outside the camp.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   To be able to worship like everybody else.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   "Would you please make me clean?"
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   That's why Jesus tells him to go to the priests
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   because it says in Leviticus chapter 13 and 14,
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.760]   "If you think the healing took place, go."
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   And this almost never happened.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   Outside of Jesus' miraculous healing of the lepers,
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   this almost never happened.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   If you had leprosy, it was a sentence of death.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.760]   Because there was no cure.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   So why this elaborate law of how to get restored
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   when He knew that this wasn't going to happen
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   for 99.9% of the people?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   You know what's interesting is,
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   the healing and restoration of a leper
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   mimicked the Day of Atonement.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   Once He came and the priests began to see signs,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   and this whole process took about seven days,
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.760]   and then on the eighth day He would be confirmed.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   And if He saw that a miracle took place
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   and He's able to be restored,
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   you know what they would do?
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   They would take two birds
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.760]   and they would slaughter the first one.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.760]   And the blood of the first bird,
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   the second bird would be dipped in it,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   and then the second bird would be released,
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   representing the uncleanness of this man being cleansed
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   because of the sacrifice of the first.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   Now on the Day of Atonement, they used lambs, goats,
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   but this was something, because it was personal,
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   they used birds.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   Those of you who know what the Day of Atonement is,
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   you know exactly how this is mimicked.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   You take one, two goats, and one,
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   they would slaughter,
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   and the other one they put their hands on,
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   and the one that they put their hands on
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   representing the sins of Israel,
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   and they would let it go,
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   representing that because of the slaughter of this one lamb,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   the other will represent the sins and be gone.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   So the restoration of a leper was a mini-event
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   of the Day of Atonement for that particular man.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.760]   Now you can see why most theologians believe
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   that this is for the purpose of teaching us
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   what sin looks like,
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   and what Christ has come to do.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   Even in this, even if it seems so random,
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   that God was trying to teach us what he came to do.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   In fact, the very next passage that we look at,
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   they come and they want Jesus to heal, right?
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   And then Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   And then he said, "Well, sins are forgiven.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.760]   What kind of authority?"
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   He's like, "I'm going to heal this man
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   so that you know that I have authority to forgive sins."
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   It's not random that this is in order
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   because the whole purpose of this story
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   is also to illustrate to us what Christ came to do.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   It says, even though Jesus told him,
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   in Mark 1.45 of this event,
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.760]   he went out and began proclaiming it freely
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   and to spread the news around so such an extent
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   This is exactly the reason why he told this man
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   not to go around telling people
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   because it was going to hinder his ministry.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   He couldn't get in.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.760]   But can you imagine if it was this crazy
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   in the beginning of his ministry,
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.760]   what it would have looked like three years later?
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   So if we don't know anything,
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   if we weren't Christians and we don't know the story,
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   we don't know what happened,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   we don't know the crucifixion,
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.760]   if we stop right here and say,
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   "Can you imagine three years of this?"
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   What do you think happened to Jesus and his disciples?
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   Oh, for sure he would have been king, right?
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   For sure he probably would have taken over the world.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   And we look at today and say, "Yeah, I mean, look at this.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   This is his beginning."
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   So he affected art, he affected politics,
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   no human being, whether you are a believer or not,
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   has affected human history in every way
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   than what Jesus has done.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.760]   And we may be able to connect this as,
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   "Oh, it's because he performed all these miracles
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   and so many people came."
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   But we know the story.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.760]   At the end of three years, instead of honoring him,
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   they ended up crucifying him.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   It would have been strange.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.760]   They would have leave him alone.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   And they crucified him.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   He's healing the sick, opening the eyes of the blind,
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   healing lepers, touching them and reversing the curse.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   How did they do that?
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   Why did they do that?
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   The scripture tells us that his fame of his miracles
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.760]   and his words were spreading like wildfire.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   And eventually, those who came for the miracles
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   will be separated with those who came for his word.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   Those people who wanted his miracles
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   and they either weren't paying attention
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.760]   or didn't like what he was saying
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   ended up turning on him.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   And then those who heard his word,
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   even though they didn't fully understand,
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   they stuck with him and endured with him.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.760]   That's why it says in John 5, 24,
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:57.760]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word,"
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   he who hears my word, he doesn't say he who,
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   he who experienced miracles, he who saw great things,
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.760]   he who experienced things, he said,
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   "No, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.760]   has eternal life and does not come to judgment
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.760]   but is passed out of death into life."
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   Everything that Jesus did, everything that Jesus does,
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.760]   everything that Jesus will do
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   is to bring us to his eternal words.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:36.760]   As you and I are here because we've been touched
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   and that the curse has been reversed in us,
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   that we will come to understand the depth, the height,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   the width, and the length of the love of Christ
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.760]   so that everything that we do
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   will simply be a reasonable response
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   to this mercy and grace that God has given us.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   Let's pray.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord in prayer
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.760]   that we will no longer live our lives
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   and compartmentalize our theology on Sunday
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.760]   with the rest of what we do,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   pursuing things that the world pursued,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   loving what they love, hoping for what they hope for,
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.760]   then hoping that the Sundays will be enough.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   Let's come before the Lord.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.760]   Ask the Lord to open our eyes, soften our heart,
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.760]   that what we do will simply be a reasonable response
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   to what we profess each week.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.760]   Let's take some time to pray again
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   as our worship team leads us.

[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   Heavenly Father,
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   we pray that you would continue
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   to be gracious to us,
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   that your grace would be sufficient for us
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.760]   as you send us to the mission field.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   Help us, Lord God, to be aware
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   of the unbelievers around us,
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   that we would live in such a way
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.760]   that they would be curious about the God that we serve.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760]   Help us to be the aroma of Christ
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760]   in speech and in conduct,
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   that we would be the light that you have called us to be,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   whether at home, with our children,
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.760]   at work, or in leisure.

[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   We pray, Father God, for your grace,
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   that as you remind us, Lord God,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   of what we have in Christ,
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   that we would overflow to be a blessing
