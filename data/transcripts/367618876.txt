[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   As many of you guys know, before coming back to Borean, we spent about five and a half
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.440]   years working in Korea.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.220]   And during my time in Korea, I attended about a half dozen funerals.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.860]   And funerals in Korea are done a little differently from how they're done in the States.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.020]   After the service, which is often held at the chapel in one of the wings of the hospital,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.140]   the body is transported in a casket to a crematorium about an hour or so away.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.280]   And the mourners, they will ride a special bus with a casket underneath, and then they
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.800]   will go.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.780]   And one thing I found extremely traumatic about the way Koreans send off their dead
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.580]   is that immediate family members have to stand in front of this window.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.440]   And as a casket is being put into the cremation chamber, the immediate family actually has
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380]   to observe and watch that.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.060]   And that was such an unpleasant experience for me, watching the families watch the box
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.400]   go in.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.280]   After the body is cremated, the ashes are placed in a small box, and then they're carried
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.500]   to a place called a columbarium.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.780]   I never heard that word before, but that's where urns and stuff are kept because Korea
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.340]   land is sparse, and so usually most of the dead are cremated.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.180]   And they're placed in urns and then housed in viewing cases and shelves.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.680]   So from the time the body is transported from the hospital to the time it is placed in an
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.380]   urn in the columbarium, every single person is fully aware at all times where that body
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.960]   is or where the box with the ashes is.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.060]   And every person there probably has the deceased person heavily on their minds.
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.520]   And if someone's bones or ashes travel with you, you're gonna wonder who that person is.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.920]   So you would ask, "Who was he?" or "Who was she?"
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.060]   And the person would have to be of significance if we were to carry around these bones.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.580]   So wherever the bones were moved, the people would be aware.
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.340]   Well throughout the entire wilderness wandering, Joseph's bones traveled with the Israelites.
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.720]   I'm not sure if you knew that.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.380]   So everyone was aware of where his bones were.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.860]   Every young child was likely made aware of the person of Joseph the moment he or she
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.740]   asked about those bones.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.700]   And we often call Hebrews 11 the Hall of Faith, as many of the Hebrew heroes are commended
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.700]   in it for their act of faith.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.220]   Joseph's bones were very symbolic and they were very important in the wilderness wandering.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.980]   So in fact, they were so important that they're just about all that is mentioned about Joseph
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.740]   in Hebrews 11.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.680]   It says, "By faith, Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.740]   Israel and gave orders concerning his bones."
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.060]   And allow me to walk you briefly through the biblical record of Joseph's bones.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.300]   You've probably never heard a sermon introduced this way in your life, but just allow me to
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   go through this.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.620]   Genesis 50, 25 to 26.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.020]   "Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, 'God will surely take care of you,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.640]   and you shall carry my bones up from here.'
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.660]   So Joseph died at the age of 110 years, and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.200]   Egypt."
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.960]   So Joseph makes it clear that he does not want his bones to be buried in Egypt long
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   term.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.000]   Exodus 13, 19.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.280]   "Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.120]   swear, saying, 'God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones from
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.600]   here with you.'"
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.040]   These bones were of such importance that Moses, even in haste to lead the people in the exodus
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.160]   from Egypt, made sure he got Joseph's bones out of the coffin and took them with him.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.520]   And if you read Joshua 24, 32, which is about 50 years after the exodus from Egypt, "Now
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.600]   they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt."
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.820]   So these are significant.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.440]   So we see from the time of exodus all the way to the conquest and the settling in of
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.840]   the promised land, Joseph's bones were always with this ginormous caravan.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.160]   So in fact, the book of Joshua, which details all of Israel's conquests, pretty much closes
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.480]   with the Israelites' burial of the bones.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.040]   So this begs the question, this is not in any of the children's Bibles, right?
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.840]   But this begs the question, why were Joseph's bones so important to the Israelites in the
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.300]   wilderness wandering?
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.120]   Why were Joseph's bones so important?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   As you guys know, Joseph, the son of Jacob, perhaps, is the most celebrated, one of the
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.880]   most celebrated in all of the scriptures.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.000]   And there are very few individuals found in the scriptures like Joseph.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.120]   He's got so much written about him, and yet it's amazing that there is almost no mention
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.440]   of a glaring character flaw, a sin, or a lapse in judgment.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.280]   And I'm not sure if you guys just were ever aware of this, but Joseph's story takes up
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.040]   more than a quarter of the book of Genesis.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.320]   And if you've been here at Berean with us for a length of time, you know that the more
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.720]   ink or detail something gets in the Old Testament, usually the more important it is to the original
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.640]   audience, 25%.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.320]   So when most people think of the book of Genesis, they think of creation, of Adam and Eve, and
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.400]   perhaps of the flood in Babel.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.200]   But the book of Genesis is more about God's selection of the Hebrew race than it is about
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.140]   creation.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.600]   And that is why more than a quarter of the book is devoted to Joseph, and just two chapters
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.400]   are devoted to the creation account.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.740]   So remember, the original recipients of the book of Genesis were the second generation
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.740]   Israelites wandering in the wilderness.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.580]   So Joseph is very much the person of interest for them.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.320]   So to this generation of Israelites, he may actually be much more important to them than
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.420]   even Abraham.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.020]   So I'd like for us to read today's text, which is a very important section of Scripture,
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.100]   Genesis 50, verses 15 to 21.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.320]   It'll be up on the screen for you.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.760]   When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.660]   a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him?"
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.620]   So they sent a message to Joseph saying, "Your father charged before he died, saying, 'Thus
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.440]   you shall say to Joseph, 'Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.880]   and their sin, for they did you wrong.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.220]   And now please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.'
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.840]   And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, 'Behold, we are your
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   servants.'
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.860]   But Joseph said to them, 'Do not be afraid, for am I in God's place?
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.740]   As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, in order to bring about
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.460]   this present result, to preserve many people alive.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.720]   So therefore do not be afraid, I will provide for you and your little ones.'
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.400]   So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them."
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.440]   I want to give you a visual timeline of Joseph's life.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:54.380]   So if you look on the screen, Joseph is 56 years old when Jacob dies.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:00.760]   And Joseph lives another 54 years after the text that we just read together.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:08.380]   And between Genesis 50 verse 21 and the rest of the chapter, the rest of the book, 54 years
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.840]   pass before Joseph gives instructions concerning his bones.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.420]   So only five verses are devoted to the rest of, the half of Joseph's life.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.820]   So the book of Genesis pretty much ends with Joseph still having half his life to live.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.460]   So why is the story of Joseph's forgiveness of his brothers just about the last major
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.600]   thing mentioned in the book of Genesis?
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.340]   Because it's of supreme importance to the original audience.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.140]   There's something about this event that God wants them to remember at all times, every
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.700]   time they saw the bones.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.540]   The book of Genesis is more descriptive than prescriptive.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.660]   And it was written primarily to remind the Israelites of something.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.540]   So the book of Genesis is actually more informational than it is instructional.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:09.460]   So when you're doing your quiet time, you got to be careful not to misapply some of
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.120]   the things that we see in the book of Genesis.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.200]   So the second generation of wanderers, they're about to enter the promised land.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.860]   And what is it that God wants them to remember about this famous patriarch?
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.320]   What is it that they want them to learn?
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:34.280]   The first thing, Joseph's forgiveness demonstrated absolute trust in God's goodness and sovereignty.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.340]   And if you guys have your app, all of the stuff that's on the slides are already on
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.200]   there for you, so you don't have to do a mad scramble to write.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.340]   First point, Joseph's forgiveness demonstrated absolute trust in God's goodness and sovereignty.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.320]   Verse 20 to 21, "You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:00.620]   about this present result, to preserve many people alive, so therefore do not be afraid."
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.300]   So what was this evil that the brothers meant?
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.000]   If you guys have grown up in the church, you've heard a lot of Joseph.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.380]   But for the sake of those who haven't, let me walk you through Joseph's evil brothers.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.300]   Joseph had 10 older brothers who were jealous of him because he was daddy's favorite.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:25.980]   These 10 brothers actually are a bunch of irresponsible, spoiled brats.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.260]   If you don't believe me, go read for yourself.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:34.940]   Okay, the 10 brothers, they're disobedient to their father and they actually go to Dothan,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.420]   very far away from where their father had told them to go, and where they're partying
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.300]   it up.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.500]   And Jacob sends Joseph to crash this party, to check up on his brothers.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:51.900]   And Joseph goes there and they put him in a pit to kill him.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.540]   But then they decide, "You know, we can make some money off this guy."
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.060]   So they decide to sell him off instead.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.020]   And they rip up Joseph's coat of many colors.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.740]   You guys may have heard Technicolor, but that's actually not the case.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.380]   Joseph had a coat of many colors.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.340]   They rip it up, they lather it with animal blood, and then they tell their father at
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.940]   home, even though they know it's going to break his heart, they tell him, "Perhaps
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.340]   your son was killed by a wild beast."
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.340]   These guys are evil.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.700]   So this is the evil that Joseph acknowledges his brothers have done.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.820]   But in a sense, when you read this passage, Joseph is saying, "God did this.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.900]   He purposed this.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.860]   He deliberated this."
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.500]   Joseph does not say, "God caused you to devise evil against me."
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.820]   But what he is saying here is, "God ultimately purposed this."
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.980]   God willed Joseph's being sold off into slavery.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.540]   God willed the brothers lying to their father.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.420]   God willed Joseph's being approached by Potiphar's wife.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.020]   God willed Joseph's being wrongfully put in prison for 13 years.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.940]   God willed Joseph's rise to power.
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:11.180]   God willed all of this, yet he did not cause sin.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.580]   Now if you are a normal person, nod your heads if you are a normal—okay, good, most of
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.580]   you nodded.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.780]   If you are a normal person, if you're paying attention, there should be some tension rising
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.540]   in your heart.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.180]   Whenever the topic of God's perfect will and sovereignty versus man's free will is brought
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.900]   up, our finite minds start spinning in circles.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:46.140]   It's nearly humanly impossible to fully grasp an all-powerful, sovereign God who hates sin
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.180]   and yet allows for sin.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.500]   And if you let your theologically finite minds run a little bit, you will hit this tension
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.220]   if you're thinking.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.820]   Why?
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.420]   Because God's sovereignty means this for you and me.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:10.820]   Every single horrible thing that has happened in our lives, God has allowed.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.920]   God has purposed.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.740]   And in effect, God has ordained.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.940]   Every single difficult, horrible thing, he's allowed.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.500]   And yet, God is love.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.500]   His will is perfect.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.420]   He is perfectly good.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.780]   And yet, he's not the one responsible for the evil that befell you.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:38.460]   So like I said, it would be very strange if you didn't have any tension in your brain
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.980]   over these truths.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.940]   Here in Genesis 50 and much of the rest of the first five books of Moses, Moses doesn't
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.060]   even try to explain this tension away.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.220]   In fact, this tension is all over the first five books.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.460]   Did God create Adam good?
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.460]   Yes.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.060]   Did God give Adam free will?
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.060]   Yes.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.620]   Did God foreknow that Adam would sin?
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.620]   Yes.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.620]   Did God set him up to sin?
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.460]   No.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.660]   Did God harden Pharaoh's heart?
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.660]   Yes.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.100]   Did Pharaoh harden his own heart?
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.900]   Yes.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:27.540]   Even the root of why the Israelites are wandering in the wilderness, there's this tension.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.580]   If you only read through the book of Numbers, if you get past Genesis, Exodus, and you get
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.900]   to, past Leviticus, and you get to Numbers, if you read only the book of Numbers, you'll
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.100]   conclude that the Israelites are in the wilderness because of their sin, their disobedience,
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.340]   and their rebellion.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.860]   That's what you would conclude, and you would not be incorrect.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.980]   But if the only source of your information was the book of Deuteronomy, you would conclude
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.940]   that the Hebrews were wandering in the wilderness because God deliberately sent them there,
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.340]   and he sent them in there to protect them from their enemies.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.300]   And that conclusion would not be incorrect.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.060]   Numbers, they're in the wilderness because they sinned.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.500]   They're in the wilderness because they disobeyed.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.740]   Deuteronomy, they're in the wilderness because God set them there.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.780]   They're in the wilderness because God put them there for their protection.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.900]   He ordained this.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.780]   God put them there for their good.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:25.220]   So for the first five books of Moses, this tension is all over the place.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:31.460]   And though you may want to, and though the unbelieving world may demand that you do,
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.420]   you don't need to explain this tension away.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.940]   Does this make sense?
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.340]   We don't need to explain this tension away because we cannot.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:48.260]   What we see in Joseph's response here in Genesis 50 is that he fully trusts in the goodness
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:55.340]   of God, and that trust enables him to forgive and repay with kindness and generosity.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:01.820]   Now Joseph does acknowledge that his brothers meant evil, and his brothers, they did an
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.580]   evil, horrible thing.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.580]   Okay?
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.020]   So he was 17 years old when he was sold off as a slave, and he's basically either a slave
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.080]   or a prisoner until he's 30.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.940]   So he is robbed of 13 years at the prime of his life.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.220]   But more than the physical hardship of the imprisonment, I'm sure it took an emotional
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:27.220]   toll on him as well because he loved his father and he loved his full brother Benjamin, and
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.640]   he couldn't see them anymore.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.880]   And he was probably worried about them worrying about him.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.500]   If I were to be taken away somewhere, my mind would immediately go to my wife, my kids,
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.980]   and my dad.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.020]   I wouldn't want them to worry.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.460]   And just imagining my wife and my kids not knowing what became of me is enough to make
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.980]   me kind of cringe, and even tear up a little bit.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.020]   If I were to be taken away somewhere, or if I was killed and one of you had to go to my
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:08.700]   wife to tell her what had happened, just thinking about that would break my heart.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   And Joseph had all the time in the world to imagine and to think and to wonder and to
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   grieve.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.260]   13 years in prison.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.020]   And one thing that we don't get in the book of Genesis is the conversation that he may
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.820]   have had in those 13 years with God.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.260]   I can't but imagine that there were times where I'm sure he was upset, he was bitter,
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:35.020]   he was confused, but cool thing is we don't have those prayers at our access.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.520]   But what we do have is Joseph's trust in God's goodness and sovereignty in the face of evil.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.660]   And this trust frees him to forgive.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.180]   So first thing that we are to learn, Joseph's forgiveness demonstrated his absolute trust
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.020]   in God's goodness and sovereignty.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:57.780]   Joseph's forgiveness puts God's faithfulness to his covenant promises on display.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.020]   Joseph's forgiveness put God's faithfulness to his covenant promises on display.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.300]   In Genesis 12, two to three, a lot of you guys already know this because this is the
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.220]   blessing toward Abraham.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.020]   And I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great so you
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.740]   shall be a blessing.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.540]   And I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you I will curse.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.420]   And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.880]   So we see throughout the book of Genesis the beginning of God making good on his promises.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.140]   So the promises here in Genesis 12, two to three, will ultimately be fulfilled in the
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.440]   person of Christ in the future.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.260]   But we get a little snapshot here through Joseph's rise to power in Egypt.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.940]   But God meant it for good.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.180]   Joseph is handpicked by God to practically save the world from hunger.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.180]   Joseph rises to power and uses his wisdom and skill to prepare for the seven years of
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.100]   famine that would come on the Mediterranean world.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.860]   All the nations were coming to Egypt to buy food.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.820]   Many lives were preserved.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   Millions were preserved.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:12.340]   So the nations were indeed saved from death because of Joseph, the man of God.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.940]   And Joseph proved to be exceptionally wise and the entire Mediterranean world benefited
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.940]   from his wisdom.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.860]   And he's only 30.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.780]   But think for a moment with me.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.860]   Imagine the scene with his brothers.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:35.880]   Would Joseph have been in the wrong if he paid his brothers back in full?
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.380]   Would he have been in the wrong to bear a grudge as they had feared?
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.980]   No.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.780]   Joseph had every human right to be vindictive and no one would have blamed him since everyone
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:54.960]   in Egypt saw him second only to Pharaoh who they saw as a god.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.380]   So justice would have been served if he just kicked them out.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.160]   But here in Genesis 50, we see that Joseph could have single-handedly rebelled against
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.860]   God's plan by exacting justice.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.680]   He could have just kicked them all out.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.820]   Every extended member of his family, if he kicked them out of Egypt and focused solely
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.380]   on his two sons because there would be less competition, right?
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.820]   If he focused only on his two sons.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.500]   But he didn't do that and God only knows why.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.340]   So Joseph's forgiveness proved faithful, the declaration of God to Abraham in Genesis 15,
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.340]   13 to 14.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.180]   I'm going to read that for you.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.060]   God said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:42.340]   that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed 400 years.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:47.860]   But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve and afterward they will come out
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.140]   with many possessions."
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.220]   Joseph's forgiveness of his brothers displayed God's faithfulness to his covenant promises
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:04.580]   and later the Israelite slaves walk out of Egypt with most of their wealth.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.940]   They plundered the Egyptians.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:12.500]   Third, Joseph's forgiveness gave testimony to the benevolent character of the Messiah
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.780]   to come.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:22.020]   Joseph's forgiveness gave testimony to the benevolent character of the Messiah to come.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:28.520]   In Genesis 50, if you read closely what comes out of Joseph's mouth, Joseph closely resembles
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.020]   the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:37.460]   His compassion, love, mercy, and kindness here, they mirror the character of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.620]   And I noticed five parallels between Joseph and Jesus the Messiah, and I'm going to have
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.380]   them up there for you.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:50.060]   First, like the Messiah, Joseph was the sovereign with all authority given to him.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.500]   He was a sovereign in the land, second only to Pharaoh himself.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.900]   See I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.660]   When Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hands and
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.540]   clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the necklace around his neck, he had him
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:10.180]   ride in a second chariot and they proclaimed before him, "Bow the knee," and he set him
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.420]   over all the land of Egypt.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.880]   So every Egyptian bowed the knee to Joseph.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:24.900]   So any attack, any slight, any offense given to Joseph was akin to the attack on Pharaoh
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.060]   himself.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.140]   And I'm sure that during the 17 years prior to their father's death, Joseph's brothers
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.500]   watched every knee bow to their brother.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.780]   So they were right to be fearful of him.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:45.860]   Second, like Jesus the coming Messiah, Joseph learned humility and he learned to submit
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.080]   to God the Father through hardship and suffering.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.180]   We read in Hebrews chapter five, verse eight, "Although he was a son, he learned obedience
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.340]   from the things which he suffered."
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:05.220]   Third, Joseph was betrayed by his brothers, by his kinsmen, by his own, and still like
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:11.900]   the Messiah who would come about 1800 years later, he did not cast them out and he was
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.740]   not ashamed to call them brothers.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.900]   For both he who sanctifies, Hebrews 2, 11 to 12, and those who are sanctified are all
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.980]   from one father for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.060]   I will proclaim your name to my brethren.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.860]   Fourth, he suffered as a criminal though he was innocent.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.980]   He suffered as a criminal though he was innocent.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:46.700]   And fifth, he was indeed wronged, but he repaid the wrong with kindness, provision, and protection.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:52.740]   Joseph choosing not to exact vengeance or retribution would have been an incredible
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.620]   act of mercy in and of itself.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:02.100]   But for 54 future years, he provides.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:08.620]   And his provision and kindness and encouragement for the next 54 years is an act of pure and
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.740]   baffling, mind-boggling grace.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.460]   So there are five parallels that you see between Joseph and Jesus the Christ.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.940]   The only difference perhaps is verse 19.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.780]   When his brothers come and bow down before him, Joseph says, "Do not be afraid for
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.940]   am I in God's place?"
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:34.660]   In the Egyptian context, actually he could have said, "Yes, I am in God's place."
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:41.300]   But Joseph does not because he understood that Yahweh alone is God.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.420]   So I asked in the beginning, why are Joseph's bones so important?
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.620]   Because the person of Joseph represented the perfect sovereignty of God and the preservation
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.300]   of his people through mercy.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:01.540]   The people of God in the wilderness needed this symbol of God's sovereignty and preservation
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:08.140]   of mercy everywhere they went.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.340]   The people of Israel would not be who they were and where they were had it not been for
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.500]   the kindness of Joseph.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.540]   If there ever was a man who could have messed up God's plan, it was him.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.900]   Imagine if he said, "Dad's dead.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.900]   Off with you guys."
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.940]   It would have been it.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.740]   But praise God that that did not happen.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.480]   Joseph submitted himself to the sovereign purposes of God.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:45.260]   So God was pleased to let Joseph suffer as an innocent man to preserve many people alive.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.420]   Hallelujah.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:58.620]   Jesus submitted himself to the sovereign purposes of God and God was pleased to crush him and
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:07.780]   to let him suffer as an innocent man, Isaiah 53.10, also to preserve many people alive.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.340]   Hallelujah.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.420]   Joseph's forgiveness demonstrated his absolute trust in God's goodness and sovereignty.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.100]   Joseph's forgiveness put God's faithfulness to his covenant promises on display.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.540]   Third, Joseph's forgiveness gave testimony to the benevolent character of the Messiah
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.980]   to come.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.640]   So what is it when you read through Genesis and you're learning, okay, this is more informational
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.040]   than instructional, but what is it then that we can learn from Joseph's life, especially
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.080]   from this episode in chapter 50?
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.500]   What is it that we can learn and apply into our lives?
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.540]   First, God is sovereign.
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.100]   He is good.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.980]   He is working out every single detail of your life, either for good or for your good.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.980]   Amen?
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:59.820]   In Genesis 8.28, God is sovereign and he is working out every detail for the good of those
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.660]   who love him.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.440]   So you can trust him.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:15.820]   No matter how bleak the circumstance, no matter how long the hardship, you can trust him.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.380]   First thing we learn from Joseph's life.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.700]   Second thing we can learn, God's plan has always been to bless his people in order to
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   bless through his people.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.140]   God's plan has always been to bless his people in order to bless through his people.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:41.980]   And more often than not, we see the means by which he blesses, it's sacrifice and suffering.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.420]   The ultimate vehicle of blessing would be the cross of Christ.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:52.860]   And you and I are invited that if we would follow after him to deny ourselves, to take
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:28:03.220]   up our cross and to follow because he will bless through our suffering.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.700]   And one other lesson that we can glean, forgiveness naturally lends itself to the sharing of the
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.220]   gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:18.220]   Were you guys not blessed in recent weeks watching the video of 18-year-old Brent Jean
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.060]   forgiving and extending the love of Jesus toward his brother's killer?
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.140]   Pastor Peter mentioned this two weeks ago, but I'm gonna bring it up again.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:32.220]   I doubt that Brent Jean foresaw his act of forgiveness, his request for a hug, and his
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.300]   tears will be broadcast to the world.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:43.780]   He was hoping primarily to give hope to the cop who killed his brother, but he ended up
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.540]   blessing millions.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.580]   And the internet trolls, they were stunned and they had nothing to say.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.580]   Scroll through all those videos.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.780]   There aren't many trolls that can say anything.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:05.500]   And I will not be surprised if Amber Geiger puts her faith in Christ if she hasn't done
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.540]   so already.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:14.940]   Forgiveness naturally lends itself to the sharing of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.420]   You're here because of someone's forgiveness.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:24.340]   So for the original recipients of the book of Genesis, this account of Joseph's story,
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.580]   again, is more descriptive than prescriptive.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.520]   It's not telling you to go do something.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.460]   So there is no "therefore, go and do likewise" in Genesis 50.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.260]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.860]   The application here is not to go forgive.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.260]   So I'm not going to go beyond the text to exhort you to forgive those who've wronged
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.860]   you.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:50.980]   To be sure, forgiveness in other parts of scripture is absolutely commanded.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.980]   Just read the parable of the unforgiving servant in Matthew 18 to see what Jesus has to say
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.020]   about those who are unwilling to forgive.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:03.180]   In fact, there are many places in scripture that lead me to conclude that no genuine Christian
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.940]   can hold a lifelong grudge.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.220]   I'll say this again.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:19.140]   If you read the scriptures, you will conclude that no genuine Christian could ever bear
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.060]   a lifelong grudge.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.600]   Genuine Christians cannot but forgive because that is the fruit of the Spirit of God working
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.300]   in the life of the saints of God.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:37.900]   So this text, forgiving those who have sinned against us, is not our main application from
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.500]   here.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.380]   The 12 tribes hearing this story of Joseph did not think, "Huh, maybe I should forgive
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.140]   my neighbor."
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.820]   They wouldn't dare to think that because the 12 tribes, when they hear the story of
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.700]   Joseph, they're like, "We are here because of Joseph's forgiveness."
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.860]   They would not put themselves in the place of Joseph ever.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:07.460]   So when we read the scriptures, we want to first think, how would the original audience
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.160]   have applied this text that we just read?
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.340]   So forgiveness is not the main point in this passage.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:22.100]   When you read this passage of Joseph's forgiveness, here's a litmus test.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:32.880]   Do you see yourself as Joseph or do you put yourself in the brother's position?
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.300]   As you're hearing this story and you naturally put yourself in the place of Joseph, there
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.580]   is an arrogance in your heart.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.260]   We are more all like his brothers.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:53.020]   So as I get older and as I mature in my faith, I realize that I am just like Joseph's brothers
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.020]   in Genesis 50.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.660]   There are many things that I've regretted over the years.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.100]   There are many people that I've hurt.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:04.500]   There are many impetuous, selfish, and rash things that I've done out of jealousy or selfish
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   ambition or self-interest.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.560]   I am way more like his brothers than I am like Joseph.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:18.620]   And like his brothers, whenever I fall into a failure or I find myself with regret, I
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.660]   too fear the sovereign.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.820]   And I cannot help but say, "I have no right to be here."
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.220]   "Behold, I am your servant.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.120]   Do with me what you will."
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:38.460]   And I cannot help but feel utterly helpless because I know the wrong that I've done.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.520]   But I know that I'm in good company because most of the heroes that I read about in the
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.060]   Bible also resemble Joseph's brothers more than they do Joseph.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.640]   And I am comforted by this.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.580]   Most of the heroes that I read about in the Scripture are deeply flawed like me.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.840]   They have betrayed like me.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.380]   They have tripped over themselves just like me.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.660]   And one thing that I notice in Joseph's brothers is they have a hard time fully embracing forgiveness
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.240]   because they have so much fear.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.300]   They doubt the benevolence of Joseph and are fearful of judgment and wrath.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.420]   I mean, there's nothing they could have done to make amends.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:19.220]   Genesis 50 is not the first exchange like this between Joseph and his brothers.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:26.140]   A very similar exchange took place about 17 years before in Genesis 45.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:32.860]   "Now, do not be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here for God sent me before
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.220]   you to preserve life.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:40.180]   God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth and to keep you alive
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.940]   by a great deliverance.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.440]   Now therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but God.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:53.260]   Do not concern yourselves with your goods for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours."
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.100]   So perhaps this forgiveness felt too good to be true.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.740]   Perhaps the brothers couldn't move past their shame and their regret.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.440]   I can relate to this.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.220]   What I see here is that even though Joseph had been nothing but kind to them for 17 years,
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:13.460]   they're worried that the kindness is now going to stop because their protection, their father
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.660]   is gone.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:22.220]   The brothers of Joseph are normal human beings and as normal human beings, they are deeply
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.100]   flawed.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.320]   And praise God that the scriptures are filled with examples of God using deeply flawed people
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.580]   to carry out his plan of salvation.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:39.460]   So if you see a Joseph's brother in your life, take heart.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.980]   And I will give you one example of a deeply flawed person that comes up in the scriptures
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:49.820]   and we will wrap up on that note.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.780]   Apostle Peter.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.300]   At the last supper, Apostle Peter arrogantly pledges to never abandon Jesus even to the
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.300]   point of death.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.280]   You guys are familiar with this, right?
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.700]   But Peter said to him, "Even though all may fall away because of you, I will never fall
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   away."
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:14.460]   Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that this very night before a rooster crows, you
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.820]   will deny me three times.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.160]   Here's the first time, Peter, but he denied it before them all second time.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.260]   And again, he denied it with an oath third time.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.500]   Then he began to curse and swear, 'I do not know the man.'
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.740]   And immediately a rooster crowed."
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:37.660]   So in the span of about 16 hours or so, Peter goes from pledging his life to fight for Jesus
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:45.300]   to denying Jesus even to the point of swearing curses upon himself out of fear and confusion.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.660]   And don't you think that Peter felt that he committed an unforgivable sin?
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.100]   Do you not think he feels absolute shame and regret?
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.760]   He has betrayed the sovereign.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.700]   He has betrayed the son of God.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:02.140]   He has abandoned his beloved brother and teacher in time of need.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:10.820]   And knowing that Jesus was going to go to trial and be executed as an innocent man,
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:19.700]   and knowing that he did nothing except deny him three times, probably messed Peter up.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.500]   And that's why it says he bawls, he weeps.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.380]   He denies him the third time and then the rooster crows.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.860]   In Luke 22, 61, you actually, Luke writes, "And then Jesus looked at him right when the
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   rooster crowed."
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.160]   I mean, imagine if you're Peter.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.620]   You hear the rooster and at the same time you hear the rooster, you see Jesus' eyes
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.500]   just looking at you.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.860]   That would kill you.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.340]   I wonder what was going through his mind when he made eye contact with Christ.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:37:00.700]   He had denied the son of God and in his moment of truth, proved himself a coward and a liar.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.220]   So after Jesus' resurrection, he appears to his disciples several times, but you don't
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.860]   see Peter excited, okay, except the first time.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:18.860]   But we find that initially, so they've all gone back to fishing as I would.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:25.500]   If I had abandoned my Savior in time of need, I wouldn't go back to fishing because I didn't
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   believe in him.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.620]   I would go back because I feel like such a loser.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.500]   I would be ashamed, I would be broken, I would be embarrassed and humbled and that betrayal
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.540]   would be on my mind at all times.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:43.900]   So when Peter finds Jesus cooking breakfast for them at the seaside, Peter's probably
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.060]   more sad than he is excited.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:52.340]   And I want to show you this account in John chapter 21.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.740]   So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon, "Peter, Simon's son of John,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.340]   do you love me more than these?"
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.300]   And he said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.140]   He said to him, "Tend my lambs."
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.140]   And he said to him a second time, "Simon's son of John, do you love me?"
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.800]   And he said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.220]   He said to him, "Shepherd my sheep."
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.380]   He said to him the third time, "Simon's son of John, do you love me?"
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.980]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.320]   And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.220]   You know that I love you."
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.420]   And Jesus said to him, "Tend my sheep."
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.340]   Peter's hurt the third time Jesus asks him about his love and commitment.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:39.860]   And I've highlighted the word love on there for you on the screen.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:44.380]   In Greek, love that is unconditional, a love that a mother has for a child,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.140]   the love that God has for the world is usually written agape love.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.340]   And you guys who've grown up in the church have heard this word before,
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.580]   agape love, unconditional love.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:01.820]   The Greek word for love that is more conditional, perhaps similar in warmth,
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:08.100]   but definitely not as loyal or fierce is the word phileo, brotherly love.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:14.100]   And I want to show you something about this exchange between the Lord and Peter.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:20.540]   First time, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon's son of John, do you agape me?"
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.900]   And Peter says, "Yes, Lord, you know that I, phileo, love you."
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.140]   And Jesus says to him, "Tend my lambs."
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:31.060]   He said to him a second time, "Simon's son of John, do you agape me?"
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.020]   And he said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I, phileo, love you."
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.580]   And he said to him, "Shepherd my sheep."
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:45.460]   And Jesus says to him the third time, "Simon's son of John, do you even phileo me?"
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:52.460]   And Peter's grieved because he said to him this third time, "Do you phileo love me?"
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.260]   And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.420]   You know that I, phileo, love you."
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.260]   And Jesus says to him, "Tend my sheep."
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.740]   Do you notice why Peter gets hurt?
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.260]   It's not because Jesus asks more than once.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:14.140]   It's because the third time Jesus asks, it almost seems like he's questioning Peter.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.540]   Do you really think you even phileo love me?
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.580]   And at this, Peter is broken.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:26.260]   You see, before the arrest of Jesus, Peter in his mind had an agape love for Jesus Christ.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.980]   But you see through this exchange that Peter no longer has confidence in his own heart.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.220]   His love for the Son of God had to be first and foremost founded on the Son of God's love
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.020]   for him.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.580]   The Holy Spirit does a lot through the life of Peter.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:53.940]   But why did Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in his sovereignty allow Peter to deny him?
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.080]   To remind Peter as he did the Israelites wandering in the wilderness, that there was nothing
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.820]   good in and of themselves.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.940]   The twelve tribes in the wilderness had to learn that every single aspect of their relationship
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.220]   to Yahweh was all grace.
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.420]   And none of it was by their merit or their loyalty.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:18.580]   So Peter, like the Israelites, needed to be humbled.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.160]   But humility is a good thing.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:28.340]   As A.W. Tozer writes, "Before God will use a man greatly, he will hurt him deeply."
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:36.260]   Before God will use a man greatly, he will hurt him deeply.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.600]   What did Peter hear upon his denial?
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.580]   He heard a rooster.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:52.260]   I find this ironic because there are roosters everywhere.
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.140]   That was probably Peter's alarm clock every single morning he woke up for the rest of
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.940]   his life.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.220]   Maybe when he was being crucified upside down, he heard a rooster.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.600]   Oh, the irony.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.420]   Every single morning the Apostle Peter woke up, he woke up with the reminder of his betrayal.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:15.520]   He woke up with the reminder of the surpassing goodness of this gracious God.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:22.740]   And I'm sure that upon that rooster call, he was reminded of his charge to agape love
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.120]   the sheep.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.920]   And Peter can now agape love the flock of God because the agape love of God the Father
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.340]   has both broken and restored him.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:42.820]   So you see, humbled people, broken people tend to be a more grateful people and a more
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.820]   loving people.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.360]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:55.560]   Humbled and broken people naturally tend to be more thankful, appreciative, and more loving.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.020]   And being broken of our pride and being released from our fears and our guilt is a process
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.900]   and perhaps with each passing year, God is showing you more and more of the sin and frailty
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.000]   that is in your heart and in your flesh.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.980]   And some of you, because of this process of seeing your failure again and again, may feel
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.020]   so just defeated and discouraged.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.080]   Some of you are living your lives filled with shame.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.940]   It doesn't mean that you're not believing in Jesus Christ, it just means that you feel
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.980]   like you're useless to an all-powerful God.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.420]   Some of you may be feeling this way.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:33.880]   And when you hear your spiritual rooster crow every day, one thing I want to remind you
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.480]   of is you're in very good company in the scriptures.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.700]   God uses broken, messed up, flawed people to bring about his plan of salvation.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.420]   Hallelujah to that.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.460]   God knows our weaknesses, he knows our frame, he knows our limitations, he knows the offenses
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.380]   that we have already committed in the past, he knows the offenses that we will commit
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.420]   in the future, he knows the offenses that we're committing now, and yet he extends kindness
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.060]   upon kindness and grace upon grace.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.980]   And like the song that we're going to sing in a little bit, "My sins, they are many,
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:10.480]   but his mercy is more."
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.060]   And God is the one who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.380]   as we're learning in Philippians.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.500]   So as God is working in you, one thing you'll look back in your life and just see progress
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   and growth.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.980]   You will see forgiveness.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.340]   You will see trust developing.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:36.460]   And you will see just a hatred, a healthy hatred toward yourself.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.460]   God will use you in your brokenness.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.660]   So what is the word of God teaching us today?
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:47.180]   I read up to Genesis 50, 21, but the chapter goes on for five more verses, and we learn
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:52.700]   that the next 54 years of Joseph's life, he's extending grace and showing kindness to his
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.740]   undeserving brothers.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:03.140]   Jesus, who is exponentially more gracious, who is eternally unashamed, calls us brothers.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.740]   What does it promise in Ephesians 2, 7?
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:13.540]   That he is going to spend eternity lavishing upon us kindness.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:18.140]   And I'd like to close with both an invitation and a charge.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:25.780]   First John 1, 9, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.340]   our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:36.740]   And later we'll read that there is no fear in love.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.220]   And as we are being made righteous, 1 John 3, 23, this is his commandment that we believe
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:49.660]   in the name of his son, Jesus Christ, and God pay love to one another, just as he commanded
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.500]   us.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:57.100]   Brothers and sisters, this morning, for you guys who belong to the Lord Jesus, I just
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:01.860]   wanted to remind you that you've been forgiven.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:08.960]   And as forgiven people, let's worship in spirit and in truth the one who's forgiven us.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:16.240]   And as we've been forgiven, let us live lives of forgiveness.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.660]   Let us press on.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.860]   Let us love one another.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.860]   For by loving one another, what happens?
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:31.040]   By this, all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.260]   May we worship the Lord because he is worthy.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.980]   And may we grow in love for one another.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:44.740]   That's the purpose of our life, to give glory to God and to build his kingdom.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.380]   Amen?
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:46.660]   Let's pray.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:56.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
