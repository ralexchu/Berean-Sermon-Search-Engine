[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520]   A podcast listener named Ted writes in, "Pastor John, I understand that episode number 798,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.600]   could a complementarian egalitarian marriage work, was a warning for anyone entering into
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600]   marriage.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.080]   But what about those of us who find ourselves already in a complementarian egalitarian marriage
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.840]   already?
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.360]   And to you, Pastor John, it is a sin to leave it, and it is a sin to sacrifice conscience
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.680]   to make the marriage work.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.520]   What options does a complementarian husband have in such a situation?"
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.000]   I found this question to be very helpful.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.120]   In fact, I think I'm going to have to correct something that I said in number 798.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   The main point of that podcast that I asked Pastor John stands, I think, namely that I
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.280]   would discourage a marriage between two believers with deeply held but contradictory views of
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.820]   the roles of husband and wife.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.800]   That is, one being an egalitarian and one being a complementarian.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   I think it will also stand that if such a marriage goes forward or has already happened,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.000]   which is what we're being asked about, it is inevitable that the effort to make it work
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.480]   will involve sin.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.640]   Now, I'll explain in a minute what I mean by that phrase "involves sin."
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.480]   It's a different way of saying it than I said in episode 798.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   So here's where the correction is needed in what I said.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.520]   What I stressed there was that the reason there would be sin in such a marriage inevitably
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   is that the conscience of one or the other spouse would have to be compromised to make
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.800]   the marriage work, and it is a sin to compromise your conscience.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.120]   Now, I think my last sentence was this.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.960]   I went back and jotted it down.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.320]   Walking into a marriage with this level of disagreement about your respective roles would
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.160]   be walking into a relationship that it is sin to leave—divorce—and in which someone
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.960]   must sin to make it work.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   And what I meant in the context in that last phrase was that someone must sin because someone
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.280]   must compromise his conscience.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.640]   But the longer I have thought about this, the less comfortable I am saying that the
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.320]   compromises one might have to make in such a marriage are necessarily compromises of
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.960]   conscience.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.120]   In other words, I think I can say to those of you who are in such marriages, whether
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.160]   you moved in intentionally or slipped in because somebody changed his mind later, where the
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.360]   husband and wife do not agree on the role of husband and wife, it may be possible to
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.840]   make concessions for the sake of preserving the marriage which do not necessarily compromise
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.320]   your conviction or your conscience.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.840]   So let me try to illustrate.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.640]   Suppose he is a complementarian and believes he should take the lead in calling his wife
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.940]   and family together for Bible reading and prayer each evening.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.920]   And suppose she is an egalitarian and bristles at the thought that his calling her and the
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.120]   children together is a responsibility invested in him simply because he is the husband and
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   the father.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.200]   She doesn't like that.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.680]   Now suppose that he makes a practice of gently, joyfully inviting the family—let's, let's,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.480]   the word is let's, not come, but let's gather—inviting the family to gather in
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   the living room each night.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.640]   His wife may believe that this practice is based on her husband's unbiblical views—that
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.320]   it is the way he's taking initiative here and doing it consistently—but may concede
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.080]   to the practice for the sake of peace in the home.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.920]   She doesn't change her egalitarian view of the Scripture, and she doesn't see her
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.360]   behavior as a compromise of conscience because she is preserving what she perceives as a
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.760]   higher good, namely the sanctity and peace of the marriage.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.080]   I think she is not sinning against her conscience in that specific choice.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   That's a correction, I think, from what I said last time.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.560]   Now, let's suppose that as the husband consistently takes the initiative to invite his wife and
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.880]   the children together for Bible reading, she increasingly bristles at this and becomes
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.300]   resistant to this view of headship.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.040]   She eventually refuses to come when he asks, and she does not see this refusal as sinful
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.640]   because she thinks he is acting with a high hand because it's not taught in the Bible
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.320]   that he should take that kind of initiative as husband.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   He continues to invite her, not demand that she come.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.880]   He sees that she is becoming increasingly resistant and angry, and so he decides to
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.920]   say to her that he won't press her anymore with invitations but will wait until she's
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.520]   ready or willing to come and then proceeds with the kids.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.840]   I don't think he has acted against his conscience in that specific choice.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.720]   He has not changed his views.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.920]   He wishes things were otherwise, but for the sake of the larger endurance of the marriage,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.000]   he relents in the exercise of his leadership over his wife at that point.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.320]   So what did I mean earlier when I said at the beginning that for this marriage to work,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.880]   it's going to inevitably involve sin?
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.920]   I realize all marriages between sinners inevitably involve sin.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.280]   I'm not saying something so banal as that.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.600]   What I'm thinking is that the particular dynamics created by differing convictions
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.540]   about headship and submission will lead to particular kinds of sin that could be avoided
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.520]   if that kind of marriage were avoided.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.600]   The sins that I have in mind would include something like this.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.160]   If he is the complementarian and backs away from the leadership he believes he should
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   take because she's resistant, then I think sin is involved in that resistance.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.760]   But if he's the complementarian and she adapts to his leadership for the sake of peace, it
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.320]   is almost inevitable, given human nature, that she is at some point going to become
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:22.360]   resentful towards his leadership or he's going to become sinfully suspicious that she's
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.800]   just acting insincerely.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.220]   In other words, the deeply held disagreement, which is not peripheral but central to their
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:41.400]   daily lives, makes those kinds of temptations to sin very, very likely and hard to resist.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.080]   So the upshot of this particular Ask Pastor John episode is to confirm a part of 798,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:57.160]   namely that a marriage between a complementarian and an egalitarian is unadvisable, but also
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:05.460]   to correct a part of 798, namely that the compromises one might have to make to cause
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:14.280]   such a marriage to persevere and to the degree possible flourish are not necessarily sinful
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.320]   compromises of conscience.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   Such an important issue.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.600]   And for those corrections and refinements.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.800]   And like everything we talked about, this is an open topic of discussion in our podcast
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   family.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.400]   And if you have a follow-up question on this or any other episode, send it to us.

[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.360]   Well every once in a while I pick up the phone and bother Dr. Don Carson and call him at
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.200]   home and get him to explain a biblical theme for 15 to 20 minutes and then share that with
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   you on the podcast.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.800]   I'm going to do that again tomorrow.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and I'll see you then.
