[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   All right, happy Father's Day.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.960]   In case some of you guys did not know, it is Father's Day today, so hopefully you guys
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.120]   had something planned for your fathers.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720]   Normally obviously we have lunches and things like that prepared for Mother's Day and Father's
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040]   Day, but we're not in normal times.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.360]   So again, we just want to thank you for the Father's Day.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.640]   Pastor Mark actually put up a little poem that somebody wrote for the father, so if
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.960]   you haven't read that yet, please read that.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.560]   If you can turn to Hebrews 7, verse 26-28, and we're going to be really spending most
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.840]   of the day on one verse, the first verse.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.480]   But I want to read that within that whole context, verse 26-28.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.220]   For it is fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.920]   from sinners and exalted above the heavens, who do not need daily like those high priests
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.860]   who offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.520]   Because this he did once for all when he offered up himself.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.760]   For the law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath which came
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.280]   after the law appoints a son made perfect forever.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160]   Let's pray.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160]   Father, we pray for your anointing.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.520]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to help us, guide us, keep us sober and anchored in Christ.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.640]   May your word go forth, convict our hearts and sanctify your church.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.800]   You know, at church, we've been doing inductive Bible study.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   I mean, that's kind of like the backbone of our church since the beginning of the church
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.840]   because we wanted the church to be Bereans.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.080]   And that's where we get our name because the Bereans were considered more noble because
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.840]   they tested to see if everything was biblical.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.200]   If there's any time in my, in the years that I've been in ministry where the church needs
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.300]   to be absolutely grounded and committed to the word of God, it is now.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.920]   Because there are so many voices and so many different people, even within the church,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.560]   demanding that we follow one direction or the other.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   And if we're not careful, we may be, we may find ourselves drifting with good intentions.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.360]   So if there's any time where we need to examine the scriptures carefully, that we may be anchored
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   in Christ, it is now.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.520]   Remember, I talked about how the Bible warns us about the second coming of Christ and he
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.000]   gave us little things that we ought to be looking for so that we are not caught off
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.560]   guard like thieves coming in the middle of the night.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.880]   And the reason why the Bible uses that illustration is when a thief comes into your house, you're
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.200]   not ready, nor do you want it.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.160]   Because it's not a positive thing for a thief to come.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.520]   So he tells the church not to be caught off guard, to stay sober and to be watchful.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.560]   Well, Jesus tells us this in Matthew chapter 24 about the end times and these are some
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800]   of the things that we ought to be sober and pay attention to.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.440]   So if you look at that, it says, "And Jesus answered and said to them, 'See to it that
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.280]   no one misleads you.'"
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.920]   One of the primary things that characterize the end times before he comes is misleading.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   There's going to be deception.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.560]   There's going to be people in the name of Christ who are saying, "This is right and
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.700]   this is wrong.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.240]   For many will come in my name saying, 'I am Christ' and will mislead many."
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.580]   The reason why he says, "I am Christ," at that time, they didn't have access to scripture
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.580]   like we do.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.760]   They're not able to run to their scroll and then examine to see if what these people were
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.140]   saying was true.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.380]   If you believe that he was Christ, you just assume that he was speaking for God.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.160]   He was the scripture.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.520]   So the modern day translation for that is when people say, "I am Christ," they're basically
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.840]   saying, "I am speaking the truth.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.240]   I am biblical."
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.160]   So the deception is going to come within the church to mislead.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.760]   Verse 6, "You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.080]   See that you are not frightened for those things must take place.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.920]   But that is not yet the end.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.840]   For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.160]   And in various places there will be famines and earthquakes."
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.560]   So if you notice, when he says that nation will rise against nation, the powerful countries,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.760]   the countries that have something to gain or something to lose, they will be in conflict,
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   it says.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.280]   But the poor countries will not be left out.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.840]   They will experience famine and all kinds of earthly disasters.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.640]   So this rumbling is not located in one area.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.880]   It is worldwide.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.480]   And if you've been paying attention to what's going on, you and I will admit that there
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.760]   is a rumbling going on.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.440]   Maybe some of you guys who are younger may think that this is part of history, and it
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.800]   is to a certain extent.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.320]   But I can tell you that during my lifetime I've never seen this, to this degree.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.920]   I remember the last time there was a lot of talk about the second coming of Christ was
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.520]   at the turning of the millennium, year 2000.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.080]   And simply because it was turning into a new millennium.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.280]   And so there was a lot of talk about the coming of Christ and be watchful, and they were saying
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.960]   this is it, this is it.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.180]   But that was purely because we were heading into a new millennium.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.800]   What we see now, it may or may not be, but it does have indicators that resemble what
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.280]   we see in Scripture.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.480]   Verse 9, he says, "Then they will deliver you to tribulation."
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.000]   So after this rumbling happens, the next stage is going to be a target toward genuine Christians.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.800]   And they will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.000]   That this persecution is not going to be coming from one group of people.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.880]   It's not going to be coming from one area or one political party.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.120]   It's going to be international.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.400]   He said all the nations, they will hate you because of my name.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.360]   And at that time, many will fall away.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.600]   The church will be tested, and those who are hanging around and have never really counted
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.360]   the cost, that it was very easy, and all the effort that the church has made to bring as
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.680]   many people into the church are going to fall out when that happens.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.200]   He says, "And we'll betray one another and hate one another."
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.280]   There's going to be division that is so intense in the church that it's not simply going to
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.960]   be division where we're going to be going to different churches and saying different
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   things.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.320]   It says they will hate one another.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.960]   It's not us against the world.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.040]   It's the church within the church are going to be throwing insults and hatred, and both
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.160]   sides are going to think that they are right.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.380]   And he says the church will be divided.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.720]   Many false prophets will arise and mislead many, that this is not isolated with a few
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.640]   and a few churches and a few groups.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   He said many will fall out.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.260]   Because of lawlessness is increased.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.520]   Lawlessness is increased.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.200]   If you've been paying attention to what's going on right now, I think you and I will
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.680]   agree that lawlessness is increasing, and it is not isolated.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.260]   This is worldwide.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.960]   Most people love will grow cold because of lawlessness.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.160]   But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.760]   The gospel of the kingdom shall be preached, that in the midst of this, there will be greater
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.600]   division, greater hatred, greater misleading, greater rumblings, greater trials, but there
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.400]   will be also greater preaching of the gospel.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.280]   And he said when the gospel reaches the remotest part of the world, he says, then I will come.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.040]   And he said these things will happen, and he says watch for it.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.760]   For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders,
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.160]   so to mislead.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   This misleading is so intense and so deep and so wide, he says if possible, even the
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   elect.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.040]   Now, when he says that, he's saying that of course the elect cannot be deceived.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.640]   But what he is saying that many people who we thought were elect, by their falling out,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.080]   will prove that they were not.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.880]   That's what that means.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:30.480]   It means that this division, this rumbling, this hatred is going to be intense.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.120]   If there's any time right now where Christians need to ground themselves in the word of God,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.400]   it is now.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   You cannot trust me.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.660]   I've been telling you that as long as you've been here.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.280]   Because I could have the best intention and be wrong.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.000]   And that's why I keep telling you, examine the word of God.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.840]   To make sure what I am saying is biblical.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.480]   So that your confidence doesn't come from this pulpit.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:04.560]   In fact, the greatest way to deceive you in this room is to deceive you from this pulpit.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.620]   So pay attention to what the word of God says.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.620]   Be grounded.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.840]   If there's any time where you need to be grounded in God's word, it is now.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.360]   If you are not, if you're not daily walking with a God, if your mind is not daily being
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:28.600]   renewed, let me just politely say, be quiet.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.440]   Because you may be being influenced by misleading thoughts and not know it.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.500]   So at best, it's best if you're not walking right with God and the word of God is not
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.140]   affecting you on a daily basis, to stay quiet.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.320]   Even if you are walking right with God, it is not the best time to be speaking.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.200]   Even a fool seems wise when he is silent.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.260]   Ground yourself with the word of God and cling to him.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.820]   Now what does that have to do with the book of Hebrews?
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.840]   The whole letter is written to people who are in similar situation that you and I are
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.560]   in today.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.720]   And much more intense.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.960]   They at one point, when the early start of the movement of Christianity, they jumped
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.040]   on board and they were high-fiving each other, visiting each other in prison, but it didn't
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.440]   die down.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.640]   It got more intense.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.080]   So after about 20, 30 years passed by, their leaders, their early Christian leaders were
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.960]   actually being beheaded and crucified.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.460]   So it was no longer just this movement of, "God is doing something great.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.760]   The Jews and the Gentiles are sitting together and sharing meals.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.400]   This is awesome!"
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.920]   Well the initial honeymoon of that has waned.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.160]   And when Jesus said to pick up your cross, they are starting to realize that that is
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.600]   what he really meant.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.480]   And when he said to count the cost, they are really starting to have to count the cost.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.660]   So some of them were beginning to drift back into their old life, which happened to be
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.440]   Judaism.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.560]   Because that is where the persecution was coming from.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.920]   That is where the difficulty was coming from.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.440]   And so they just kind of slided in.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.480]   They didn't deny Christ, nor did they deny the world that they came from, and they were
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.040]   kind of straddling both fences.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.080]   And that is why he says, "You must not drift."
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.480]   And over and over again, he says, "You must not drift.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.680]   You have to be anchored in Christ, because when you drift, you won't even know that you
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   are drifting."
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:37.200]   So the situation that Paul, or the author of Hebrews, is speaking to is very similar
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.080]   to the danger that you and I are in right now.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.240]   Because there is so much confusion with so much voices, with so much passion being spoken
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.640]   that completely contradict each other.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.000]   I have my opinions, but I am not asking you to trust my opinions.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I am asking you to be grounded in God's Word.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.400]   Anchor in Christ.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   See Hebrews chapter 7, verse 26, starts out by saying, "For it was fitting for us to have
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   such a high priest."
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.640]   That language in English is very peculiar, because fitting seems so casual.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.120]   That Jesus Christ, it was fitting.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.880]   The word fitting means suitable, or proper, or right.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.320]   For Jesus to be our high priest, that it was simply fitting.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:32.440]   I don't know about you, but when I look at that, that's the furthest thing that I can
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.520]   think of about Christ's sacrifice for us.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:44.040]   I mean, the Son of God dying for us?
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.000]   Son of God crucified for you, for me?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   That's fitting?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.160]   That's right?
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.780]   In what universe could that be right?
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.760]   The just for the unjust?
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:02.060]   When will you ever see in our justice system a just person taking the punishment of an
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:08.200]   unjust person, and that be celebrated?
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.560]   How could this be fitting?
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:17.800]   Well, the word fitting, and I think in English, at least in the way that we understand it,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.440]   doesn't necessarily fit.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.200]   I think the better way for us to understand what he means by fitting, that it was necessary.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.840]   That only Christ could fulfill that role as our mediator.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.680]   It was necessary because he's the only one who qualifies.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.000]   It was necessary because he's the only one.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.200]   There's only one mediator between us and God, Jesus Christ.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.520]   And so when he says it was fitting, a better way for you and I to understand it is, it
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.200]   was necessary.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.560]   There was no other way that you and I would have had access to this holy God other than
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.280]   for Christ to become our mediator.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.520]   In the very Lex 9, he actually describes what qualified him.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.160]   And so as we look at the meaning behind these words, what I want you to pay attention to
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:22.120]   is as much as he's describing the qualification of Christ, he's also describing what disqualifies
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.760]   us.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.940]   And that's why it says he is holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.180]   And that's the whole point.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.040]   He is unlike any other priest that came before him.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.120]   He is unlike any other priest that may come after him.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.200]   He is unlike any other human being that has ever lived.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.640]   And that's why it was necessary for him to be high priest.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:54.000]   So as we study these words, these three words, holy, innocent, and undefiled, remember as
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.960]   much as Christ is being separated from the other high priest, remember that these are
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.440]   descriptions that disqualify every single one of us.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.320]   He starts out by saying the reason why it was necessary was that Jesus was holy.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   He was innocent.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   He was undefiled.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:19.360]   So if you read this casually, what you may get from that is Jesus is holy, holy, holy.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.160]   All three words basically means that he is perfect.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.720]   He is pure.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   And you may just move on without really thinking more than that.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.480]   Superficially, it's true.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.960]   All these words on the surface is saying the same thing, that Jesus is perfect.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   He is holy.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   He is holy.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.300]   He is holy.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.000]   But there's a reason why he goes in depth.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.400]   Now whenever we read scripture, we have to read scripture understanding that this was
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.160]   written by God himself.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.320]   There is no fluff in the word of God.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.000]   I remember back in school, you know, basically, you know, I was a Bible major undergrad and
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.720]   then I studied, you know, obviously theology and seminary.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.160]   And I took six, seven years just studying the Bible.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.800]   And so most of what we do is just study the text and write papers.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.520]   Study the text and write papers.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.000]   So just writing papers.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.800]   I just pump out papers for seven, eight years.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   That's what I did.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.040]   But I remember one of my professors would always say to us, if he didn't like your paper,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.920]   he would write on the top, stop pumping sunshine in your paper.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.640]   And what basically that means, if it was a 10-page project, that you have three pages
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.760]   of content and seven pages of fillers.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.580]   Meaning you could have said that in three pages, but the seven pages was because you're
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.900]   trying to meet the requirement.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.940]   And I'm sure you, some of you know exactly what I'm talking about, right?
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.100]   We know how to pump sunshine.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.320]   There is no sunshine in the word of God.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.420]   The author is God.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.200]   You and I could put all our energy, everything that we've studied, you can Google it and
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.800]   spend the rest of our lives writing a letter to make it as perfect as we can, using the
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.600]   perfect vocabulary to gain all the wisdom that you and I can research and ask people
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.800]   and write this paper, and we cannot come close to the depth of meaning of what the word of
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.540]   God says.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.280]   Because this is an omniscient, omnipotent God who knows all things.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.440]   Everything that Google, that you can search, is only a drop in the bucket with what he
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   knows.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.800]   And his wisdom, he used certain words, he used certain people, he used certain contexts,
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:44.280]   he used certain cultures to communicate with us his deep ideas, eternal thoughts.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.880]   My point is we should never read the scripture just casually, just skim through it and read
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   it and say, "I've done it.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.720]   I've done my Bible reading project."
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.840]   We ought to dig, uncover, ask questions.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.520]   That's why in the inductive Bible study, one of the first things that we learn, we teach
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.420]   is you have to ask questions.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.120]   Even if just one word, ask questions, ask 10 questions, even if it sounds ridiculous
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:13.280]   because the asking of the questions will uncover deep treasures in the Bible.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.320]   Now I say all of this is set up, holy, innocent, undefiled on the surface may look the same,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   but it is very purposeful.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:32.680]   As much as it describes the holiness of Christ, it also describes in depth the sins that disqualify
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.500]   us.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.040]   If you look at the Old Testament, especially in the book of Leviticus, when God says to
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.120]   give offerings and sacrifices, he doesn't simply say, "You've missed the mark and so
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.840]   give these sacrifices."
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:51.280]   He was so specific of what that sin looks like.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.840]   Your heart, your intention in the ceremony, at home, medically, things that you did on
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.160]   purpose, things that you did by accident, about the animals, about children, about families,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.120]   about parents, about obedience.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.760]   I mean, it is so accurate.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.240]   He doesn't simply say, "You're guilty of sin."
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.960]   He goes in depth.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.600]   The purpose of all of that is that we recognize where we are in our relationship with this
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.520]   holy God.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.320]   The word "holy."
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.600]   The typical word that you and I think of holy is the word "agios."
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.400]   So when, oftentimes, when we talk about the word "holy," it says "agios."
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.040]   "Agios" basically means, literally means to be set apart.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   The word "set apart" is a very general word.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.640]   So an animal could be agios, holy, because it's set apart for God's use.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.800]   A priest can be agios.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.200]   He could be holy because he was set apart.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.360]   So we have a holy priesthood.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.560]   The gathering of the people are holy.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.400]   The priesthood is holy.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.440]   The items that are offered up that was used at the temple are holy.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.740]   The temple itself is holy.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.320]   The curtain is holy.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.920]   Anything that has been set apart for God's use is holy.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.200]   So that could mean, morally, atonement.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.360]   It's a very general term to talk about something that has been set apart for God's use.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.960]   So you and I are holy because we have been set apart.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.280]   We are called His children.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.240]   But that is not the word that is used here.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   It is not agios.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.960]   The word He uses here is "asios."
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.000]   And the word "asios" means obedience.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.860]   That you and I, or whoever, obeyed God's command perfectly.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.960]   So agios can be given to us freely.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.700]   Asios is something that you have to earn.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.920]   And so when He says He is asios, then not only was He set apart, but He was the only
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.740]   one who was perfectly holy.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.860]   Perfectly obedient.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.780]   A good example of that is we see it in the book of Leviticus, chapter 10.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:18.700]   Peter and Aaron's two sons are anointed and cleansed, sprinkled with water, and they were
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:25.860]   considered holy because they were set apart to be the first priests to offer sacrifices.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.400]   But they disobeyed God by offering strange fire.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.060]   He didn't listen to what God said.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   These are the prescriptions.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.900]   These are the things that you need to do in order for you to be able to come before me.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.100]   And they didn't follow it.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.100]   They disobeyed.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.460]   They were agios, but they weren't asios.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.860]   And as a result, they see the capital punishment.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.740]   Romans 15.4 says, "Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name?
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.420]   For You alone are holy."
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.020]   The word "You alone are holy" is asios.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.920]   We all together are agios because we have been set apart.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.140]   But it says Christ alone is asios.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.900]   You know, if you're a Jew, the word "without defect" would have been ringing in your ears
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.600]   when it came to the temple.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.100]   Because over and over again in the book of Leviticus, you will see the term "without
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.580]   defect, without defect."
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.620]   And it's not just referring to the animals.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.980]   The method had to be perfect.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.340]   Who touched what?
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.180]   Only they could touch it.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.220]   What animals?
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.640]   What kind of animals?
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.600]   How much of these animals?
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.100]   He was so precise.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.580]   They had to be without defect.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.940]   The method, the location, the animal.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:48.060]   But out of all of them, the priests had to be without defect.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.060]   Leviticus 21.21.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.780]   "No man among the descendants of Aaron, the priest who has a defect, is to come near to
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.220]   offer the Lord's offering by fire, since he has a defect.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:03.140]   He shall not come near to offer the food of his God."
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:11.560]   If you believe that this is the way to get to God, what a tremendous burden.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.780]   Who can fulfill this?
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.220]   You make even one mistake.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.340]   You know people joke about having Asian parents that A is not enough.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.340]   You have to have A plus.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.340]   And if you get A plus, you have to A plus plus.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.100]   And you get A plus plus, you have to get A plus plus plus.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.740]   You can never satisfy these Asian parents.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.420]   I don't think Asians are the only ones guilty of that, but that's where typically the joke
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.420]   is.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:45.380]   I mean, it makes Asian parents look like the gracious people in the world.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:52.980]   You have to use the right pen, the right paper, the right ruler, the right seat, at the right
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.840]   time, and the right penmanship.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:06.100]   And you can't get 99.9% right, because the moment that you get that 1% wrong, you're
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.220]   defected.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:15.880]   If this was the way to get to God, who can worship this God?
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.940]   But that was not the point.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.660]   The whole point of all of this was the point to somebody who was going to fulfill all of
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.660]   this.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:30.040]   And that's why he says it was necessary, because no man could fulfill this.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.740]   No man could be without defect.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.520]   No method could be perfect.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.140]   No location, no animal is perfect.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.320]   That's why it was necessary for Christ to be our mediator.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:48.760]   Now we can stop right there, because that alone disqualifies every human being that
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.120]   has ever been born on this earth, past, present, and future.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.920]   And we can move on just from that and say, OK, we're done.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   We need Christ.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.120]   But the Bible is much more accurate than that.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.600]   And then he says, not only is he asias, he is innocent.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.720]   And the word there is akakas.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.000]   The King James is translated harmless or blameless.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.440]   Literal translation is without evil.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.240]   Whenever you see in the Greek the word ah in front of a word, the ah basically means
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.640]   without.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.680]   So akakas is evil.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.520]   So without evil.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.200]   You know what's really interesting about this word is that the theologians believe the application
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:37.360]   of this word literally means to not be duplicitous.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:47.880]   That in your doing good, somebody who is akakas always has some evil in it.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:55.120]   Meaning every human being in every good endeavor, because of our fallen nature, there is some
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.520]   coveting.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.860]   There is some self-righteousness.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.520]   There is some wanting glory.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.040]   There is some retribution.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.160]   There is some pride that always taints every good thing that we do.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:15.280]   And only Christ is completely akakas, without evil.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.200]   And that's what it means that he is separated from all the other human beings.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.180]   Because you and I do not qualify.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:29.580]   Even at our best attempt, it is with our fallen nature that we do what we do.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.000]   You know the perfect example of that is found in Matthew chapter 16, 22 to 23.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.880]   This is right after Jesus tells Peter, "Who do men say that I am?"
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.840]   And Peter gives the right answer.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.040]   And then Jesus says, "Upon this rock I will build my church."
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.640]   So he's flying high.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:51.400]   And then in the very next passage, Jesus says, "I'm going to go to the cross."
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.920]   And Jesus and Peter, with his good intention, and you have to remember that Peter loved
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.280]   Jesus.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.800]   He was not just some casual fan of Christ.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.960]   He was in his heart willing to die.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.200]   I believe that he was willing to die.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.600]   And that's what he was doing at the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.320]   But look what he says.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.160]   Peter took him aside and began to rebuke Jesus and saying, "God forbid it, Lord.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.920]   This shall never happen to you."
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.720]   I mean, it's because he loved him.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.280]   Not only does he say that, he says, "It's not going to happen to you.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.480]   Even if they all fall away, I will not.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.200]   I'm going to stay loyal to you and I'll fight till death.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.560]   If you die, I die."
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.720]   And I think Peter meant it with all his heart.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:48.560]   But even in his good attempt, there's pride.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.880]   He's tainted with evil in his heart.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.240]   There's self-confidence, self-glory that all the other disciples were wrestling with.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.520]   And Jesus rebukes him, says to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.280]   Satan.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:19.040]   Even in his loyalty, even in his attempt to do good, Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.960]   Can you imagine how shocking this must have been for Peter?
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.000]   I said this because I love you.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.040]   I said this because I'm literally willing to die for you.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:38.080]   I can't speak for the other disciples, but I will go to death with you, for you.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.480]   And Jesus says, "No, that's satanic."
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.760]   He doesn't just say, "Peter, you missed the point.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   You missed the mark.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.760]   You didn't come all the way."
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   He says, "No, it's satanic."
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.200]   And he describes why.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.480]   "You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on God's interest,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.520]   but man's."
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.240]   What is the man's interest that he's talking about?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   Jesus as the man.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.200]   He was trying to preserve his friend.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.320]   He was trying to fight for his friend.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.440]   And he said, "It's satanic because you're concerned about my flesh."
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.480]   That's not why I came.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.440]   I came to die.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.080]   God came for the spiritual redemption of mankind.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.680]   That's what he means.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:36.320]   That in your attempt to do good, you deny the cause of Christ.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.040]   So that's what he means, "Cacas," without evil.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.720]   That even in our best endeavors, we have been tainted by sin.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:55.280]   So if Christ is the only one that is without defect, there is no hidden motive behind him,
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.840]   that all that, even when it seems to be no good, that only Christ is good.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.360]   The best and the safest place for you and I to be is to be where he is.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.280]   Do what he does.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.080]   Say what he says.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.320]   Go where he goes.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:17.800]   That we do not make our own cause and then cry out to God to join us.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.480]   That we see what his cause is and we join him.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:29.080]   That even in our very causes, we are tainted with "Cacas."
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.800]   Matthew chapter 9, 1 through 6.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.080]   People come to Christ with a friend that they have who is lame.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.320]   They open his house, put him down.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.560]   I mean, they took a risk messing up someone's house.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   They cut the line with many people who are there because they're desperate.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.280]   So you can imagine the pain of the paralytic.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.280]   And they want to help their friend.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.600]   So again, it was no small task.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.240]   That even if we get yelled at, even if we get put to jail, even if we get stoned, I'm
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.280]   going to help my friend.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.880]   So you can imagine the suffering of that individual and the friends who are coming alongside to
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.200]   help him, but Jesus doesn't heal him.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.120]   What does he say?
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.960]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   Because they didn't understand.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.840]   They didn't thank him.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.520]   We did all of this and that's it.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.640]   And who are you?
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.400]   How dare you even say that?
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.160]   In response to that, he says in verse 5, which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven,"
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.440]   or to say, "Get up and walk."
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.000]   "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.840]   Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your bed, and go home."
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   He fed the poor.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.200]   He opened the eyes of the blind.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.000]   And he raised paralytics, all for this purpose.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.160]   So that mankind may know that he came to forgive sins.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.280]   Because man's problem is not being paralytic.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.120]   His greatest problem is not hunger.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.760]   His greatest problem is not racism.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.720]   It's much deeper than that.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:35.400]   Those are only symptoms.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.080]   That's why we need to pay attention.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.880]   Examine the scriptures.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:50.200]   That even in the context of doing good, that we have cacos in us.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.280]   Only Christ is a cacos.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.920]   Third and finally, he says he is undefiled.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.000]   Again, without defilement.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.800]   That same word is being used in Hebrews 13.5, saying that do not defile the marriage bed.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:14.080]   The word basically means Christ, that he is obedient externally.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.200]   He did everything that God told him to do.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.840]   Internally, he is without defect, without sin.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.240]   Externally and internally.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.900]   And then the third word, undefiled, means that he continues to remain in that position
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.980]   forever.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.500]   You see how precise this is?
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.320]   It covers everything.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.600]   It covers your external obedience, it covers your internal obedience, and it covers the
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:42.920]   continual obedience, without defect.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:50.320]   The guilt offering in the Old Testament, of the five major offerings, was when somebody
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:56.680]   dedicated, let's say an animal to be dedicated and to be given as a sacrifice, it became
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.480]   agias, it became holy.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.920]   But an individual inadvertently defiles that animal, that person who gave the offering
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.640]   now can't offer that animal.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:13.560]   So the guilt offering basically called the man to basically give sacrifice to atone for
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:22.480]   his sin, but also to compensate for the damage that he's done by giving an extra 20%.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.280]   I mean it's very precise.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.440]   So the whole offering was, if you defile someone else's offering, you have to give them and
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   compensate them, along with repenting for your own sins.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.160]   But what defiled that animal?
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.000]   Obviously the animal was without defect when they brought it to the temple, but what would
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.400]   defile the animal?
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:53.280]   Because if it was already defiled, he wouldn't be able to bring it to the temple to begin
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.960]   with.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:03.160]   The animal gets defiled when he is declared without defect, and he is dedicated to the
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:09.240]   Lord and another defiled human being touches it.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.800]   That's how the animal gets defiled.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.980]   And so they can no longer use that animal for sacrifice.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:22.520]   It was the human touch that defiled that animal.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.880]   You know, one of the best explanations of this is found in the book of the holiness
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.640]   of God, if you've read that.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.920]   There's a section on that that describes about the punishment that Uzzah got.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.440]   After David gets anointed as king, the Ark of the Covenant is with the Philistines, and
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.240]   so he sends people to go get it.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.680]   And Uzzah is on that team, and he gets it.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.900]   And as they are bringing the cart back, the Ark of the Covenant slips, and Uzzah reaches
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.960]   over and he touches it to keep it balanced so that it doesn't fall to the ground.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.360]   Uzzah's anger is burned, and as a result, Uzzah dies.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.920]   And it doesn't explain, it just moves on.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.880]   I remember reading that for the first time thinking, how is this fair?
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.360]   Uzzah was actually trying to help.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.280]   Uzzah was trying to straighten this out so that the Ark of the Covenant would not get
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.920]   dirty.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:25.280]   And he went all the way over there to get it.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   I think R.J.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.960]   Sproul does the best job describing this because I remember years ago when I read holiness
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:36.080]   for the first time, it was paradigm shifting.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.060]   Because by that time, I was already several years as a pastor, and I've given sermons
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   on holiness.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.760]   I've memorized scriptures on holiness.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.940]   He would evangelize by saying that we've offended a holy God, so I've been talking about this.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:56.200]   But it didn't hit me the way that it hit me when I realized to the depth of my sins and
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.960]   who God is.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.440]   So I understand.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.600]   If you've been at a church and you kind of read it, you skim through it, but you don't
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.960]   really understand the gravity of this, I think R.J.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.760]   Sproul does the best job.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.200]   He says in his book on that chapter about that event, we must ask the question, what
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.760]   was the Ark doing on an ox cart in the first place?
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.600]   God was so strict about the holy things of the temple that the Kohothites were not even
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.080]   allowed to gaze upon the Ark.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.960]   This too was a capital crime.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.440]   God had decreed that if a Kohothite merely glanced at the Ark in the Holy of Holies for
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.320]   an instant that he would die.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.180]   Not only was Uzzah forbidden to touch the Ark, he was forbidden even to look at it.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.640]   He touched it anyway.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.140]   He stretched out his hand and put it squarely on the Ark, steadying it in place lest it
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.440]   fall to the ground, an act of holy heroism?
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   No.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.360]   It was an act of arrogance, a sin of presumption.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.560]   Uzzah assumed that his hand was less polluted than the Earth, but it wasn't the ground or
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.560]   the mud that would desecrate the Ark.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.140]   It was the touch of man.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.040]   The Earth is an obedient creature.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.640]   It does what God tells it to do.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   It brings forth its yield in its season.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.200]   It obeys the laws of nature which God has established.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.380]   When the temperature falls to a certain point, the ground freezes.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.640]   When water is added to dust, it becomes mud, just as God decided.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.100]   The ground doesn't commit cosmic treason.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.560]   There is nothing polluted about the ground.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:29.120]   God did not want his holy throne to be touched by that which was contaminated by evil, that
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.240]   which was in rebellion to him, that which by its ungodly revolt had brought the whole
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.480]   of creation to ruin and caused the ground and the sky and the waters of the sea to groan
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.760]   together in travail waiting for the day of redemption.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   Man, it was man's touch that was forbidden.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.820]   Only Christ is undefiled.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.360]   No human being can stand before a holy God and live.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:08.400]   In Jeremiah 6, 14-15, before the Assyrians come and take Israel to captivity, Jeremiah
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:15.040]   pleads with the nation of Israel, and one of the constant themes of the book of Jeremiah
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.400]   is that they have taken the sins of my people lightly.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.360]   And you see that phrase repeated over and over again.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.160]   They have healed the brokenness of my people superficially saying, "Peace, peace," but
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.640]   there is no peace.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.360]   And then he describes, were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done?
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.960]   They were not even ashamed at all.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.640]   They did not even know how to blush.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.960]   Therefore they shall fall among those who fall.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:50.160]   See, they're crying out for peace, but God says there is no peace.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:40:00.700]   There will be no peace until there is an answer for sin.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:13.760]   People today are shocked because they've seen racism on videos.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:21.840]   Racism has always been, but the problem with mankind goes much deeper than what you have
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:28.040]   seen, much deeper than that.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:33.240]   What you are seeing on video that is different than maybe 10, 15 years ago, it's being blasted
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.800]   on video everywhere, but mankind has not changed.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.560]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.580]   The condition of man has not changed.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:52.560]   The problem that we see now is much deeper than what you have seen.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.320]   People ask me, "Why did you stop doing homeless ministry?"
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.560]   I mean, you thought, you and your wife Esther thought that you were going to do that full
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:10.200]   time and that you hated the church and all that was true, but why did you stop?
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:20.280]   I remember years ago, I was out on the street and I saw this lady, a middle-aged lady, and
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:27.880]   she had two young kids, one girl, one boy, and what I remember about those two kids were
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:38.440]   like this bright brown eyes, so cute, so intelligent, but they were living out of their mom's truck.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.320]   This wasn't a truck that had the camping thing in the background.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.440]   It was just the two-seater in the front.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   That's where they were at.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   The mom was in the driver's seat and the other two kids on that, and that's where they were
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.960]   living.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.280]   So I felt bad and I said, "You know what?
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.280]   Why don't you come with me?
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.480]   I'm going to get you a hotel room.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.440]   We'll pay for your stay.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.640]   We'll buy you food, and then send your kids to school.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.880]   Send your kids to school and then maybe hopefully we can help you get on your feet and then
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.400]   we'll provide whatever it is that you need."
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.800]   So she agreed.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   She came with us, put her in a hotel near where we were living at that time, and I would
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.440]   come and check up on her every once in a while, and about a week to a week and a half passed,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.640]   and I get a phone call from the motel and she said, "You need to come here because the
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.440]   lady won't open her door."
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:38.160]   So I go and I knock on the door and when she hears my voice, she finally opens, and I opened
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.600]   and it was disaster.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.680]   She was a hoarder.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.840]   So she had trash piled up above her knees.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.240]   So it was at the height of the bed, and I was shocked because there's no way they could
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.540]   have created this trash in that short time.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.880]   She must have brought it in from outside, so something was not well with her.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.440]   So I convinced her, "Let the ladies come in and clean up.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   That's all you need to do.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.600]   Just leave for 10 minutes and let them clean up."
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.840]   She agreed, cleaned it up, and I asked her, "Just let them come in and do their...
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.560]   You don't have to do it."
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.520]   Another week goes by and I get a phone call and he said, "The lady hasn't let us into
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   the room for the last week."
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.800]   I go back to check up on her and I open the door, same thing, and I asked her to do that
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.840]   and she said, "Okay."
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.560]   And then the very next day she packed up her bags and she disappeared.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   The kids were gone.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.320]   And I was so broken for those kids.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.560]   I've seen plenty of ladies like her out on the street during that time, but these two
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.240]   kids were bright young kids who were just following the mom around, just sleeping in
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.880]   their truck.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.720]   And I couldn't help her.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.680]   I remember another guy named Rolando.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   He was a Cuban-African-American guy that I met out on the street.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:08.280]   He was funny, he was charismatic, but he was an alcoholic.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.160]   I invited him to come and he felt bad, so he said, "Can I stay at the church?"
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.440]   And not at this church, but the previous church I was serving at in Irvine.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.680]   And so he stayed at the church.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.000]   He stayed there for months and months.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.040]   And so our church guys would take him out to eat, buy him stuff, but after a few months
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:33.680]   we would see him disappear and then find him in bars, completely drunk, out of control.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.320]   Then I'd have to reprimand him and then the next week or so he'd be fine and then after
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.320]   that, same pattern over and over again.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:46.880]   And after about two, three months of that, he ended up leaving and I couldn't help him.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.680]   Remember I told you that I was out on the street for a few days because I wanted to
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   see what it was like?
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.520]   If I'm going to work with the homeless, I need to know what it's like.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.960]   There was a guy named Angel.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.680]   His name was Angel.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:05.160]   He was an ex-gang member, a drug addict that I met out on the street.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.960]   He became a Christian while he was in prison.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.080]   So he came out and I met him and I befriended him.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.480]   And we were good enough friends where I would invite him to church and he would come on
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   the weekend.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.920]   I would go pick him up, hit up church, and then I would take him back to his housing
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.720]   that he got.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.560]   And so when I was out on the street, he was the one who took care of me.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.600]   And that's why I was able to go out because him and another friend basically stuck with
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.200]   me the whole time, all three days.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.680]   He's the one who took me to the shelter, to the food lines, and showed me what was going
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   on.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:47.920]   But after a while, Angel couldn't kick his crack at it.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:53.280]   So he would disappear for two, three months, and then he would show back up at Santa Ana.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.280]   And I said, "Angel, where were you?"
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.520]   And he was embarrassed, but he told me, "I was in jail."
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.520]   I said, "What happened?"
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.520]   He's like, "Yeah, I fell.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520]   I got back on the street."
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   I said, "Yeah, I fell.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:08.440]   I got back on with crack."
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.080]   He went through that for about a year, year and a half before he disappeared.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.080]   And I didn't know where he went.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.400]   I just assumed that he did something more serious and he got sentenced to jail.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.640]   Again, this is before cell phones.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.680]   This is before internet.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.200]   So once they disappeared, they disappeared.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:31.440]   I can tell you story after story after story of frustration after frustration after frustration.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:37.160]   The story that to me stands out the most, I remember I shared with you, I had a guy
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.240]   that I met out on the street.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.000]   He slept with us in our house for a while.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.440]   His name was Michael Lee.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.280]   He has an Asian name, but he was an African American guy.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.840]   So I met him out on the street, and you would never know he's homeless.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   He was homeless.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.840]   He was another guy who went to prison because of drugs, came out, he cleaned himself up.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.640]   And Esther and I were just talking about him just a few days ago.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.120]   And the thing that we remember the most about Michael is he smelled like soap.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.800]   He was so clean.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.200]   He was constantly like washing.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.200]   I don't know.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:19.440]   I never really put it together that maybe I, you know, if I was to psychoanalyze him,
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:26.320]   that he constantly felt dirty because he couldn't kick the cocaine out of it.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:32.520]   But he was at our church, and I was with him for almost a year and a half, two years.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.480]   Brought him to church.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.560]   Some of our old, old Korean members, no, again, I'm not talking about our church members.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.360]   When I say old, I literally mean old.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.280]   They loved him because, you know, we used to play so much basketball, and he was good
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.560]   at it.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   He was our best rebound.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.880]   He played like Dennis Rodman.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.120]   You know, he was the trash guy who picked up everything.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.200]   He hustled like crazy, and he would give it to the shooters.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.640]   I liked to shoot, so I liked him.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.440]   So our church guys bought him basketball shoes because it was his birthday.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.640]   He was about two, three years older than I was.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   But they went too far.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.520]   You know, this is a guy who was struggling with crack, and they bought him Michael Jordan's.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   And I remember it was a ridiculous amount.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.000]   It was like $160, $170 they bought him because they loved him.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.040]   They loved the fact that he's there, and he's getting off of drugs.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.400]   And then he would just disappear.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:32.800]   And I was so frustrated with him because I was doing discipleship, and he'd be doing
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   fine for a while.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.480]   Remember I told you I got pulled over by a cop with an African-American friend?
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.720]   It was Michael.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.840]   So in order to help him, I told him to come into my house so that we can watch him, keep
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   him accountable.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.560]   This was before we had kids.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:49:01.200]   Well they gave him that shoe, and a few days later he disappeared for two weeks.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.720]   After two weeks, I said, "Man, what's going on with Michael?"
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.760]   You know, and I went out to Santa Ana looking for him.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.480]   And I knew it had to be something with drugs because he was constantly struggling with
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   that.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.520]   Two weeks later, he showed up at my house barefoot.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:24.760]   And he was older than me, but he was crying like a baby.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.240]   He was crying because he couldn't kick his habit.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:34.600]   Man, I wanted to be charismatic.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:41.480]   I wanted to just lay hands and just cast that out of him.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.580]   I felt completely helpless.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.800]   Because he was with me for two years.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.760]   I loved that guy.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:50:00.520]   So every time he did that, it was like a good friend that I couldn't bring out of the mud.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.780]   Eventually I had to send him home, which was in Virginia.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.640]   We bought him bus tickets to go home.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.080]   And again, this is before the internet, this is before cell phones.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.860]   So I would get letters every once in a while, and he told me he found a job.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:21.200]   And the job had some sort of a drug program where they would move him from place to place
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.180]   so that he doesn't get comfortable and find drugs.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.400]   And he would send me every time, saying, "Hey, I'm doing well.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   Thanks for your support."
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.900]   And this was going on for maybe about a year or so.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.380]   Then he just started disappearing, and I stopped hearing from him.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.380]   And I just assumed that he started struggling with drugs again.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:51.180]   The problem of mankind is not something you and I can fix.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.940]   You and I do not have that power.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:51:00.740]   It is the arrogance of man to think that if we just work harder, if we are better united,
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.900]   if we put better policy, that we can fix this problem.
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.860]   You know, so many people say, "Oh, we've got to stop the sex trafficking."
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:16.020]   Yeah, I mean, if that doesn't burn your heart and bring you to tears, there's something
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.860]   wrong with you.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.540]   But the way that we go about helping is, "Oh, we're going to go and we're going to deliver
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.660]   them from these evil men."
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:32.460]   What they don't realize is that the majority of these young girls are coming out of their
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.660]   villages voluntarily.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:42.140]   They walk into where these Westerners are and offering up their bodies because that's
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:46.900]   the only way they can eat.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:56.700]   And we think that if we just eradicate these bad men, that that will take care of the problem.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:04.180]   The fallenness of where you and I are is much deeper and greater than you and I could possibly
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.780]   imagine.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:12.700]   So when the Bible says that it was necessary for Christ to come, it means He is the only
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.660]   way.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:23.900]   He is the only way that we can even make a dent on what you and I see.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:32.220]   The years of frustration of trying to help people, I realize I don't have the power.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:40.580]   What is foolishness to man is the power of God, Christ crucified.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.900]   That's what Paul means.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:51.020]   They seek for signs and the other look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:56.500]   Foolishness to those who are perishing, but the power of God for those who are being saved.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:03.220]   So as we are stirred by what's going on around us, do not run to the same hope that the world
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.020]   is running to.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.260]   Do not run to the same things that they think are going to fix this.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:15.140]   It should remind us even further to get back to what God called us to begin with, to go
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.360]   make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.740]   and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and lo, I am
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.860]   with you to the end of the age.
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:34.560]   We speak of coming to Christ so casually because the church has in the last three, four decades
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:41.020]   have tried so hard to make God so accessible to as many people as possible and they have
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:45.660]   completely presented the wrong God.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.900]   Exodus 32 verse 33 verse 20 says, "But he said, 'You cannot see my face, for no man
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.160]   can see me and live.'"
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   Deuteronomy 5.25, "Now when they should, why should we die?
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.880]   For this great fire will consume us.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.860]   If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, then we will die."
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.960]   They didn't see God's presence as something to be welcomed because they knew who he was.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.240]   They were trembling in fear when God told them to come.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.720]   He said, "If we go, we might die."
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.520]   Even when Moses came up and just glory, a reflection of his glory brought fear to the
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:26.960]   nation of Israel and they begged him to stay in the tent because the reflection of God's
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.720]   holiness scared them to death.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   First Samuel chapter 5 verse 10, the Philistines wanted the ark to be gone because everywhere
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:42.360]   the ark went, people broke out in cancer and tumors.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.560]   So they didn't welcome the ark.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.680]   David, not knowing as a young king, thought, "We're going to bring this presence of God
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.240]   and God's going to bless us again."
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:56.920]   And he learned through the death of Uzzah not to take lightly.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.680]   And that's why in Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5, when Isaiah is confronted with God's holiness,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.120]   he doesn't say, "Thank you for showing me your glory."
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.700]   That was not his response.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:14.120]   He broke down and he says, "Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.280]   lips and I live among people of unclean lips.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.040]   For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts."
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.440]   He saw that he wasn't holy.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:29.660]   He saw that he was defiled.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:38.160]   That's what he means when he says it was necessary.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:44.880]   Our fight is not against flesh and blood.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.640]   If there's any time that we need to be reminded of this is right now.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.280]   Right now.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.240]   Our fight is not against flesh and blood.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:00.840]   It is against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of darkness, the
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.920]   spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:17.040]   You're not going to go into battle to conquer demons simply by yelling and by organizing
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.200]   and by screaming.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:28.740]   If there's anything that we are sure to do now more than ever is to be the light.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:33.320]   Make the hope of Christ clear.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:40.760]   Let the world where it's hurting know there's hope in the name of Jesus Christ and Jesus
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.000]   only.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:53.280]   Let's pray.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:57:00.120]   Heavenly Father, we need you desperately.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:09.680]   Lord, so many people are hurting, crying out.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:15.520]   I know, Father God, that you saw the hurting world and you had compassion and that's why
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.720]   all of us are here.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:26.920]   Help us to show that compassion by deed and by words.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   Help us, Lord God, not to be indifferent to the suffering of sinners.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:42.120]   But in the midst of that, help us never forget why you came.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:47.800]   Help us to be your ambassadors and be a light, especially now that we would not turn from
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.880]   your word to the left or to the right.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.440]   With all the confusing voices, Lord God, even coming from within the church, help us to
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:03.320]   hear your son's voice and only his voice that we may follow him.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:06.040]   May it be a great opportunity for revival.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.120]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:08.520]   Amen.
