[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.500]   Yesterday, Anna Banana had a choice.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500]   To drink juice or to have faith in God.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500]   What do you think she chose, everybody?
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   [crowd shouting]
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500]   That's right.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000]   Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500]   boys and girls,
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.500]   cheer on your contestants as we prepare for the final event of day four.

[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   [cheering]
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Kevin Sysavage, yeah!
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   [cheering]
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   In lane two, we have

[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   [cheering]
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And, last but not least,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   we have Anna Banana from Korea!
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   [cheering]
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Who will win?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Let's find out.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   So, today's event is going to be the pool little javelin throw.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Each contestant will line up.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   First, we have
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Kevin Sysavage from Koala!
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   [cheering]
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He's javelining.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   How far will he throw it?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   [cheering]
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   He's going. He's going.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And he throws!
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Wow! 100 feet!
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   How amazing!
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Next, in lane two, we have
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   the representative from Square Antonio.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   She's walking up to the plate and
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   whoo! So average!
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   At lane three, we have
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Wakanda!
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   [cheering]
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And that was a great try!
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Now, last but not least,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Fabio!
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   [cheering]
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Aww!
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   What a giant effort she made.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So, there you have it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   In first place, we have the Koalas.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Second place, we have Square Antonio.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And in third place, we have Wakanda.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   No fair! We should have won!
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I drank two of those juices!
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, me too!
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Guess what? I drank three of the juices!
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Two of them! Two of them!
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   What juice? What is juice?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Wakanda forever!
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I did my best, but I still lost.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I trusted in God instead of the juice
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and yesterday, how come I didn't win?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Don't worry.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   God has a plan for everything.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And if we believe in Him,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   then He will deliver us from our sin.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Okay, whatever, Kiwi Seaweed and Anna Banana.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, Kiwi Seaweed, Anna Banana.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Don't worry, Briggs.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I, although we're from different places,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I stand with you.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And I know, with you and God.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I know that although you didn't win,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   God has a plan for us.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And that He will win the final battle.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   God, I trust in you.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Will you please deliver us?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Strong!
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Rampant!
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   The blood will make you stand and fall!
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Fallen can raise up strong!
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Harker!
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   With the sting of the whip on my shoulder,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   With the salt of my sweat on my brow,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Elohim, come high, and you hear your people cry,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   "Let us now, this dark hour,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Deliver us, deliver us, deliver us,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   For the Lord will remember us
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Here in His burning sand.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Deliver us, there's a land you promised us,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Deliver us to the promised land."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   [applause]
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Attention, attention, everybody.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   We just took an unauthorized blood sample
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   and discovered illegal substances in the following countries.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Scrantonia and the Quallens have been disqualified.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Therefore, the winner is Berea and Wakanda.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Congratulations!
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   [applause]
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   [whistling]
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   [cheering]
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Hallelujah!
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Salvation and glory and praise be to our God.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   No!
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   We cheated!
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   We cheated fair and square!
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   [cheering]
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Genius!
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Wait, what?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Wait, you haven't heard the last of us.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Let's go, boys.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Thanks, Kiwi.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Thanks for teaching me and reminding me to trust in God and not the Jew sin.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Jesus delivered us from our sins, and if we have faith in Him,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   then He'll deliver us from our evil deeds.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yeah, God does always win.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But what if I don't trust in God?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You know, God sent Jesus to us for a reason,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   so that we could go to heaven and be with God.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   But if we don't believe in Jesus, then we're going to go to hell.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   But nobody wants you to go there, so that's why Jesus is our only option.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And as the world turns, so do the tables turn.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Those who are last are now first.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Tomorrow, we will have the finale, where there will be a very special surprise.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So stay tuned.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Raise your pointer finger up high if you think you know what will happen next,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and put it over your mouth and save it until tomorrow.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Have a great night, everybody!
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   [cheering]
