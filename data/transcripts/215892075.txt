[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.360]   They thought that if they worked harder, they did more, sacrificed more, that there would
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.040]   be a greater position for them in kingdom.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   Matthew chapter 17, 20, Jesus sees a bunch of disciples coming to him and because they
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.480]   try to cast out this demon and this child and they couldn't.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.720]   Jesus responds to them and he says, "Because of your little faith, for truly I say to you,
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.320]   if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.280]   from here to there,' and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you."
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.440]   Not too long ago, I visited my old hometown in Korea.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.480]   I spent a few years there.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.520]   So I remember if you go there, there are some buildings that I can recognize, but in my
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.800]   mind I'm thinking, "Oh, I remember there was a hill here."
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.640]   So I remember, you know, if I turn a corner and sure enough, the hill's still there.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.320]   You know, and I turn this corner, go to the left, I remember there was a big mountain
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.320]   in front of our house.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960]   So I would go there and turn around, it's like, "Shoot, there it is, the hill's still
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.960]   there."
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.560]   You know, so if you've ever visited your old hometown or somewhere that you grew up on,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.400]   you haven't been there for a long time, I'm sure a lot of things have changed, right?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.360]   Stores have come in, maybe houses were broken down and new apartment complexes came in,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.200]   but typically mountains don't disappear, right?
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.840]   Because human beings don't move mountains, we move around it because it's impossible.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.480]   Jesus uses that illustration for a reason.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.840]   In other words, he's saying there are certain things that you can't do by your own works.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.520]   See, faith of a mustard seed, he says, move mountains.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.480]   If you've ever seen a mustard seed, mustard seed is like a lint.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.760]   A friend of mine went to Israel and brought back a gift and it was a bookmark and it had
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   nothing in it.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.920]   So I said, "What is this?"
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.040]   And he says, "It's a mustard seed."
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.240]   It was that tiny, I couldn't see, it was like a lint.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.360]   So I thought it was a lint, he said, "No, that's a seed of a mustard seed."
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.680]   I was like, "Wow."
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.320]   So Jesus deliberately chose the smallest thing that he could possibly think of and then says
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.520]   that little thing can move the biggest thing that he could think of, right?
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.040]   So it's a hyperbole, he's exaggerating to make a point that there's things that you
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   cannot move, that it needs a work of God.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   And the reason why a faith, that tiny little faith that connects us to God is much more
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.680]   powerful than the greatest thing that we can possibly apply to move this mountain.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   That's what Jesus was saying.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.920]   That little faith that causes us to be connected and tap into the power of God can move mountains.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   But without that faith, without that connection to God, even our greatest efforts can barely
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.240]   make a dent on this mountain.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   Now, what was he referring to?
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.720]   Obviously he's referring to the great works that they're capable of doing, but there's
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.440]   something greater than that, that I think that is the problem with mankind.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.480]   The scripture says, "Can a leper change his spots?"
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.720]   And even if he could, a sinner cannot one day just wake up and say, "I'm not going
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.000]   to be a sinner anymore."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.560]   Now this room can be divided up into introverts and extroverts.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.160]   Some of you guys are introverts, some of you guys are extroverts.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.080]   And I don't know why, but I've never seen an introvert who thinks he's an extrovert.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.320]   I've seen many people who are extroverts think they're introverts.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.440]   I don't know what the reason, psychology behind that.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.400]   You study and tell me, let me know.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.160]   But you can't wake up one day and say, "I'm going to be an introvert today."
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.040]   You just don't do that.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   It's like that's who you are.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.640]   You don't wake up one day and say, "I'm going to be an extrovert.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   I'm just going to go and be the life of the party today.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280]   I'm just going to forget who I am."
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.600]   You just don't change like that.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.840]   People just don't change like that.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.480]   What you like or dislike, the kind of food you like, you just don't change like that.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.200]   If we can't change something as fundamental as just maybe how I interact with people,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.800]   for a sinner to one day wake up and say, "You know what?
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.920]   I'm not going to be a sinner anymore.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   I'm just going to change."
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.600]   See, that's a mountain that cannot be moved by human effort.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.720]   No matter how hard we try, we can scratch at it.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.520]   We might think we can make a little bit of dent, but that mountain cannot be moved.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.200]   It needs a work of God.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.160]   That's why Jesus said to Nicodemus, "The only way to enter the kingdom of heaven is to be
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.800]   born again."
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.920]   How can you be born again?
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   We weren't born physically, and you can't be born spiritually without God's work.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.400]   That's exactly what he meant.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.040]   The whole purpose of the law given to the nation of Israel was to show that there was
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.220]   a mountain between them and God.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.200]   To make sin utterly sinful.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   The reason why anybody would even attempt to move this mountain is because he has no
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.320]   idea how big this mountain is.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.200]   He said, "Anybody who goes into war, a king, he's going to first calculate to see, 'Can
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.240]   I win this war?'"
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.640]   The only reason why anybody would even enter to think he can possibly make a dent is because
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.560]   he has no idea how big this mountain is.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.740]   Not only does he not know, he has no idea his own strength.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.720]   That after just half a day of digging, maybe barely making a scratch on this rock, you're
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.700]   going to be fatigued and tired, you're going to quit.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.560]   So you don't know how big the mountain is, and you have no idea how weak you are to even
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.940]   make a dent.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.340]   You see, the Jews were given every advantage.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:02.100]   They had the covenant, they had the law, sacrificial system, they had the prophets prophesying.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.180]   And all of it was to point to Christ.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.380]   That's exactly what it says in John 5, 39.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.440]   You search the scriptures because you think that in them, you have eternal life.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.700]   That somehow if you dissect it and you apply it in your life, that somehow you're going
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.740]   to be able to move this mountain.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.360]   But Jesus says, "And it is they that bear witness about me."
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.460]   If all of your study of scripture and all of your pursuit of righteousness is our attempt
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.380]   to make a dent on this mountain, it would only lead to further condemnation.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.580]   All of it was to point you for the need for a Savior.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.860]   All of it was to set a foundation that salvation is by faith, by grace alone.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.980]   And then he says, "Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life."
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:55.980]   So that little faith in God is much more powerful than all the efforts that we can possibly
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.980]   pour in.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.200]   And that's, again, the common mistake that we make in our walk with God.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.420]   When we have problems, our first thing is how do we fix it?
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.140]   Because I've gotten a certain place in my life and I know how to get ahead in life.
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.220]   And I've been successful and I'm moving up and I know how to put money and invest and
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.460]   buy the stock at the right time and sell it at the right time.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.920]   And so we become professionals.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.140]   And so pride begins to set in in our heart and we begin to think that maybe if I apply
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:35.460]   all that made me successful into my Christian life, that somehow we would have more success.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.980]   And that is exactly the opposite of the principles that are taught in the Beatitudes.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.640]   There's a reason why he deliberately chose people who weren't educated.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   They weren't successful.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.540]   In fact, these disciples had the biggest failure right before Jesus went to the cross.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.540]   See, the kingdom of God, the principles of the kingdom of God is flipped completely upside
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.540]   down.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.540]   It is not different.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.540]   It's completely opposite.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.620]   And that's why Jesus says, "Do not love the world or the things in the world.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.460]   And all that is in the world is not from the Father."
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.660]   You can't live by the principles of this world and by the principles of God because they're
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.660]   not different.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.100]   They contradict each other.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.180]   Little that we do in faith is much more powerful than a lot that we pour out without it.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.340]   Third and finally, salvation by faith in Jesus is the absolute cornerstone of which the kingdom
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.340]   is built.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.340]   Verse 33 says, "They have stumbled over the stumbling stone and as it is written, 'Behold,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.700]   I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of defense, and whoever believes in
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.100]   him will not be put to shame.'"
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:53.180]   The term stumbling stone is a favorite Old Testament reference to Jesus, and specifically
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.100]   the cornerstone that was rejected.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.260]   In 1 Peter 2.7, the quote of, again, Psalm 118.22 says, "The stone that the builders
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.540]   rejected has become the cornerstone."
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.560]   Not just any stone, it became the chief stone.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.460]   It was the stone.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.500]   So again, you probably heard this before, but cornerstone basically at that time meant
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.540]   if you don't have the cornerstone right, everything that you put on, everything, no matter how
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:29.300]   high the building, no matter how strong the building seems to look, it is absolutely crooked.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:36.140]   If salvation by faith and by grace isn't the foundation upon which we build, everything
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.940]   is going to eventually crumble.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.580]   You know, I don't know about you, but when Ikea first came out and they would sell things,
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.620]   and prior to that, all the furniture was built for you.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.820]   So you just bought it and put it and plopped it in, but right now, you don't have to
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.460]   save money, they give it to you, you buy a little shelf, they give it to you in like
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.660]   5,000 pieces, and then you got to go through all of this instruction, and I don't have
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.780]   no patience for that.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.180]   I remember when I first started to put these things together, and I was like, I just kind
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.660]   of get a general outline, and I feel like I'm pretty handy with my hands, so I know
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.580]   where these things go.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.820]   I would go and put all this together, and I feel pretty good about myself, and I put
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.780]   it together, and then you would see this huge metal piece.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.380]   Hmm, I wonder why this is here.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.340]   So my initial thought is, Ikea is wasting their money.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.620]   They put this metal piece in here, it's absolutely unnecessary.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.020]   I don't know where it fits.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.180]   And it looks fine, the shelf is standing, you know, after a couple of weeks, and you
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.740]   bump into it by mistake, and all of a sudden it starts to tilt.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.620]   And it's like, huh, this is weak.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.180]   Maybe that metal piece has something to do with this.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.060]   And you go back and read the instructions, and you realize it was the centerpiece in
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.500]   which everything holds together.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.020]   And that's why it's tilting, that's why it's weak, and so I waste all my time and
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.820]   go back and I got to tear everything back and then read the instructions.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.580]   So I've done that enough times where now I don't mess with it, and I just go straight
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.360]   to the instruction.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.780]   And I know that our ladies like to make fun of the husbands, they get lost and they don't
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.740]   want to ask direction.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.220]   I've wasted so much time doing that in my life, that's the first thing I do now, I go
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.700]   straight to the instruction or ask people, like, where do I go, how do I get here?
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.300]   You see, the scripture says Christ wasn't just a stone, it wasn't just an important
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.620]   foundation, it was the chief cornerstone.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:42.700]   It says everything that we learned about life was about Christ crucified.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.140]   Everything the Old Testament pointed and got people ready for it, the gospel was about
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.420]   Him preparing to go to the cross, and everything else in scripture, the book of Revelation
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.940]   is about the consummation of what He started at that time.
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.660]   Everything was about Christ.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.100]   Now why is this absolutely essential for us to know?
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:09.100]   Because once we begin to move from that, for whatever the reason, we're basically building
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.660]   on something that's going to eventually crumble on sand.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.460]   It's just a matter of time, when it gets tested, it's going to crumble.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.060]   Now I don't think, I think most of us sitting in here, if I was to ask you, do you believe
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.940]   in salvation by faith alone, justification by faith alone, not by works?
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.540]   If you believe in salvation by works, you wouldn't be here.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.540]   That's my guess.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.420]   Maybe some of you guys secretly, it's like, I reject everything you say.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:42.260]   You know, I think most of you sitting in here will have no problem signing this doctrinal
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.740]   statement.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:54.540]   But the real question, where the rubber meets the road, is how does that affect your life?
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:03.860]   How does this upside down principle, this upside down principle of where God chooses
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.460]   the lowly to dumbfound the wise.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.780]   In fact, 1 Corinthians 3, 11, Paul is talking to a church who's divided, and they're all
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.700]   talking about Jesus and the cross.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.140]   They were already Christians, they were saying, I follow Paul, I follow Peter, I think Peter
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.260]   is a leader, so we should follow him.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.940]   Apollos is a better preacher, and I like the way he preaches, so I'm going to follow him.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.620]   And so the church was divided.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.940]   And so Paul comes in, in 1 Corinthians 3, he says, no one can lay a foundation other
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.700]   than that which is laid in Christ, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.380]   How can you be divided and say, I like this, I like that, when there is only one foundation,
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.580]   which is Jesus Christ.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:45.020]   And then, prior to that, he reminds them, the whole reason why this division is taking
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.300]   place is because they're one-upping each other.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.340]   They're one-upping each other.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:14:00.540]   And this principle of this world, where we're trying so hard to become somebody, every single
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.300]   one of us, and it's so deeply embedded in us, there isn't a single person who isn't
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.220]   guilty of this.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.020]   We work hard to make more money so that we can get ahead, we teach our kids so that they
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.780]   can sacrifice, so they can get ahead, we become proud when my kid reads a little bit faster
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.620]   than the other kid.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.100]   Every single one of us has that innately inside of us, and when we begin to practice those
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.700]   principles inside the church, it begins to divide the church.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.700]   Who's better?
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.860]   Who's smarter?
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.340]   Paul reminds them, in 1 Corinthians 1.26, "If we consider your calling, brothers, not
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.220]   many of you were wise according to the worldly standards."
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.940]   Let's stop right there, okay?
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.660]   We read this as a historical document, and it's like, okay, he's reminding them the gospel.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.740]   Think of this as a personal letter he's writing to the Corinthians, and the Corinthians are
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.740]   reading this.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.460]   He's saying this about me.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.180]   Not many of you were smart.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.900]   That's what he said.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.900]   You don't know that God chose you because you weren't all there.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.340]   You weren't the A student.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.700]   God deliberately chose you because you weren't the A student.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.540]   Not many of you were powerful.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.020]   Not you're trying to be somebody in the church.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.580]   Not many of you were of any significance.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:18.900]   You're trying to be somebody in the church, but outside the church, you're nobody.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.780]   Think how offensive this is, if you're reading this, and he's saying this about you.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:28.100]   Not many were from noble birth, but God chose what is foolish, and he's talking about you.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.900]   He's not talking about the principally foolish.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.100]   No, you were foolish.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.960]   God chose what was foolish in the world to shame the wise.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.140]   God chose what is weak, which is you, in the world to shame the strong.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.940]   God chose what is low and despised.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.940]   That's you.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.940]   You're dumb.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.940]   You're weak.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.100]   You don't come from noble birth.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.100]   You're foolish.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.260]   Again, he says weak.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.260]   You're lowly.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.260]   You're despised.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.180]   God chose to shame the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, so
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:07.020]   that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.140]   That's the basic of the gospel.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.140]   You're smart?
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.140]   Great.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.420]   Don't let it hinder you.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.100]   You're talented?
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.540]   Great.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.780]   Don't let that interfere in your love for God, because it does.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:29.620]   As soon as it pops us up to think that somehow I got something to contribute to the kingdom
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:36.140]   of God because of my smarts, because of my experience, because of my noble birth, it
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.900]   actually hinders us from coming to Christ.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.940]   The same way that the Jews say, "How can this be?
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.940]   This is not fair."
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.480]   And then they just begin to say, "Well, because I'm this educated, because I have all of this."
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:57.520]   The very basic principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ brings all of us low.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.880]   Because the thing that is destroying us, the core nature of sin, is self-righteousness,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.640]   self-boasting, self-justification.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.480]   Wasn't that Satan's temptation?
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.500]   Wasn't that Adam and Eve's temptation?
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.600]   Wasn't that the temptation of Tower of Babel?
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.120]   Wasn't that the temptation of every generation because they wanted to be somebody?
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.080]   And Jesus Christ says, "No."
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.640]   If you want to live, He says what?
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.600]   "Die."
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:36.040]   If you want to follow me and be my disciple, take up your cross and deny yourself.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:43.720]   The very core principle of the kingdom of God brings the haughty and He humbles him,
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.800]   He brings the lowly and encourages him.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.320]   That's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, "For I decided to know nothing among you except
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.120]   Jesus Christ and Him crucified."
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.520]   Because anything else, anything else, like, "Oh man, you know, I have so much experience
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.680]   doing this and I did this and I'm so successful."
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.800]   All of these things could be useful.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:14.720]   But if it's not coupled in faith, knowing that He took nothing, that any power that
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.000]   I have, any usefulness that I have is because God was being merciful to me.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.160]   That's why boasting and pride, it doesn't just not go together, it contradicts.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.720]   You may not know, maybe you are aware of it, but the greatest hindrance to our walk with
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.000]   God is our pride.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's our pride.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.160]   Now, pride has all kinds of ways to manifest.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.920]   Sometimes pride could be coming out of our lips, sometimes pride can come out of the
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.720]   way we interact with each other, sometimes pride comes out in anger, sometimes pride
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.240]   comes out in judgmentalism, sometimes pride comes out in self-righteousness.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:59.560]   But the core of what keeps us from God, why we think every single day that I can get along
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.940]   this day without praying, is pride.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:11.200]   We don't see the urgency and desperateness of where we are because of pride.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.800]   That's why Paul says, Galatians 2.21, "I do not nullify the grace of God, for if justification
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.920]   were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose."
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.520]   It doesn't just hinder us, it ruins everything.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:32.280]   See, the fundamental principle of the kingdom of God, which is started by the gospel, it
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.400]   will be built by the same principles of the gospel and it will carry us on until the end.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:45.320]   That's why in Galatians 4.3-7, as I close with this, Paul says, "In the same way, we
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.680]   also, when we were children," he's talking about when we were non-Christians, "were enslaved
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.960]   to the elementary principles of this world."
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.840]   Enslaved by the pattern that is taught in this world.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.440]   Do this, don't do this, and you're going to achieve.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.160]   Sometimes we bring that even into the church.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   If we just work hard enough, if we do this and if we do that, so somehow God can be glorified,
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.640]   I can build the kingdom.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:18.120]   That's what Paul says, "When I am weak, He is strong."
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.760]   Sometimes the best thing that we can do is to get out of the way.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.280]   Less of me so that more of Him can shine.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.320]   See, this elementary principle of this world is what is killing us.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:35.000]   The same principle that we are taught to be somebody, to make something of ourselves,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.480]   to get to the next level.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.960]   That's what's killing us.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.240]   He says, "He came, who were once enslaved to the elementary principles of this world,
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   but when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.360]   under the law, to redeem those who are under the law so that we might receive adoption
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.440]   as sons.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.320]   And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.160]   'Abba, Father.'
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.680]   So you are no longer a slave, but a son.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.520]   And if a son, then an heir through God."
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.160]   That what we work for is not here.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.720]   Our payoff is not here.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.200]   And that's why he says that our life is now hidden with Christ.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.760]   But when He comes, when Christ comes in His glory, we will be glorified with Him.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.120]   So the whole principle in which a Christian continues to live and build and preach the
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.440]   gospel has been flipped upside down.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.320]   If we live by the principles of this world to try to get to the next level, do you not
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.960]   know that that is what is frustrating your life?
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   That is why you feel stuck, because we're trying so hard to bend His will toward mine.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   And God will not be bent.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:56.240]   So the very principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, justification by faith, brings us
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   to a point where we say, "I cannot.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   I cannot.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.960]   And I am unable to.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:14.040]   And all that I have, all the things that I may be good at in this world, actually is
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.880]   causing me to be proud and is hindering me from coming to Him."
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.600]   See, the gospel of Jesus Christ brings us to the same point.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.000]   Whether you are rich or poor, whether you are powerful or not, whether you are successful
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.320]   or unsuccessful, we all come through the same door by the mercy of God.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.280]   If you can take a minute to pray with me as I ask our praise team to come up.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.800]   Again, take some time to pray.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.520]   That's probably the most powerful thing that you can do, every single day and every single
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.520]   moment.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.320]   You're struggling with anger?
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.120]   Pray.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.880]   Ask God to help.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.840]   Are you lost?
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   Are you bitter?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.440]   Are you confused?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.240]   You don't know what's coming?
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.600]   The most powerful thing that we can do every single day is to come to God, that faith of
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.860]   a mustard seed.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.360]   If it engages God, it's much more powerful than all the counsel, all the work, all the
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.280]   money, all the friends that can come to encourage you.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:31.000]   So let's take some time to pray the basic fundamental principle of Christ as chief cornerstone,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.680]   that whatever we do, that we will build upon this.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.400]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
