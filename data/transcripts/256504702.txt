[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 12, I'll be reading from
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.320]   verse 9 through 13, but our main focus is going to be on verse 13 today.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.760]   Romans chapter 12, verses 9 through 13.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.880]   Let love be genuine, abhor what is evil, hold fast to what is good, love one another with
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.360]   brotherly affection, outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.360]   Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord, rejoice in hope, be
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.520]   patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer, contribute to the needs of the saints, and
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.440]   seek to show hospitality.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.360]   Let's pray.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.320]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your goodness.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.400]   I thank you Lord God for the brothers and sisters that you've placed us in the midst
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.920]   that we may practice love, grace, patience, and mercy.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.000]   All these things that you command us to use our gifts to build up the body of Christ,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.600]   that your name may be exalted, that the light of Christ may shine brightly in this dark
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.160]   world, that the world may know that there is hope outside of politics, of finances,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.560]   and economy, that there is hope in the name of Jesus Christ and him alone.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   Help us Lord God to fix our eyes upon Christ and what he has done, and the future hope
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.480]   that is coming with him, that our lives Lord God may reflect the very gospel we profess
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480]   to love.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.800]   We pray that your word would be anointed and your Holy Spirit would send forth Lord God,
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.240]   and it would not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   So we pray for your grace this morning, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.120]   Again as you guys know, we've been studying through the book of Romans and I counted,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.920]   I went back and counted about close to 90 sermons that was focused on up to chapter
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   11, close to 90 sermons.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.680]   And so we've been speaking or we've been talking about the justification of Christ, and then
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.620]   recently we made a transition to chapter 12 where it says, "In view of this mercy to present
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.520]   your body as a living sacrifice."
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.760]   So what does it mean to live according to the faith that we profess?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.320]   So chapter 12 and on, it focuses on the application of what it means to be a Christian, not to
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.680]   just profess the doctrine and say, "This is what we believe and we are thankful for Christ,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.040]   for what he has done and all that is important and it is foundational."
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.800]   But based on that foundation, what do we do as Christians?
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.360]   How do we apply this?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.520]   And we talked about how chapter 12 verse 1 says, "To offer your whole bodies, not just
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.800]   a portion, but everything that we are ought to be offered up as a living sacrifice."
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.520]   Not just a weekend, not just a portion, but all of it.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   And then he talked about how in verse 3 to verse 8, that he's given us different gifts
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.960]   to carry this out, to practice this.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.320]   And even though not everything about application is about love, the scripture makes it absolutely
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   crystal clear that the greatest of the commandments is to love God and to love your neighbor as
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   yourself.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   And all of the commandments can be summarized by loving your neighbor as yourself.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.880]   So even though he may not be expressly saying that you ought to love in perseverance, you
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.160]   ought to love in tribulation, that in application, the greatest application of perseverance would
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.800]   be in practicing love.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.260]   The greatest application in using our gifts is to love.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.100]   So even though I may not be mentioning the word love throughout every one of these commands,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.680]   I hope that you understand that that is what's assumed in scripture, that all of the things
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.360]   that God has commanded us to do is ultimately to practice the love that Christ practiced
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.000]   on us.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.600]   So again, as I mentioned, we've spent, I forget, I don't know how many years have gone by,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.960]   but we've spent about 80 to 90 sermons just talking about justification of Christ.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.040]   And then we go to chapter 12, we're talking about application.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.880]   But Philemon, I think, is a great book.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   If you've never read or studied through the book of Philemon, I really encourage you to
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.480]   take your time, not just to read it, but to dissect it and go through what this letter
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.800]   is about.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.600]   Because the letter of Philemon is probably the most vivid picture of the power of the
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   gospel.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.680]   You know, the theme of this year for our church is to live worthy of the gospel and application.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.000]   And I don't know of any other letter, I mean, I think all the letters obviously is rich
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.400]   with the gospel, but Philemon is an illustration, it's a picture of the power of the gospel
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.600]   changing people's lives.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.320]   If you know the letter, the letter is basically Apostle Paul, he's sitting in prison and he's
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.560]   trying to reintroduce a runaway slave, Onesimus, back to his former master, Philemon.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.940]   And so this short letter is him pleading with the former master, Philemon, to receive this
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.920]   runaway slave who basically ripped him off and took off.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.480]   You have to understand the context of this whole situation that none of this is even
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   possible.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   You can't even entertain that a letter like this actually was written and something like
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   this actually happened in history if it wasn't for the power of the cross.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.320]   Humanly speaking, what this letter contains is something that the world will never be
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.800]   able to understand.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.860]   Just look at Paul himself, this is a man who before he met Christ, devoted himself to go
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.480]   out and kill, drag Christians into prison.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.000]   He hated the Gentiles.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.360]   He's sitting in prison, not worrying about himself, he's worried about a runaway slave
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.600]   to be restored back to his owner.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.520]   Why would he even care about that?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.300]   The very fact that he even writes this letter is a demonstration of what God has done with
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   this man's life.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.480]   This is a guy who was on the top of the world before he met Christ.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.400]   He was probably, maybe a member of the Sanhedrin already.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.800]   He's a direct disciple of Gamaliel, the greatest Jewish scholar of that time.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.480]   His dad is a Roman citizen, so he's probably coming from a wealthy family.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.120]   So humanly speaking, as a Jew, he basically already made it.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.600]   In fact, in the book of Acts, when he goes out preaching the gospel, the governors and
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.160]   kings already knew about him.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.040]   He's a man who was so studied, he said, "Your studies have made you crazy."
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.160]   So he was already well known, even before he came into the city, that this great Jew
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   became a Christian.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.420]   Now he abandoned everything to talk about Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.080]   And now he's sitting in prison, and he's writing this letter to insignificant in the eyes of
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.320]   the world, this runaway slave to be reconciled to his master.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   The slave himself, Onesimus.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.800]   You have to understand that if you ripped off your master and you took off, and your
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.960]   master hired people to catch you, it would have been instant capital punishment.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.720]   He would have had absolutely no right as a slave, but as a runaway slave, his life would
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   have ended.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.320]   So the fact that he's even risking to go back to his master, basically his life could have
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.480]   ended if this didn't go well.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.000]   The fact that his repentance required him to be reconciled to his master, and he was
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.800]   willing to do that, and that he's carrying and going back to be reconciled, this runaway
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.640]   slave, even this master himself.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.480]   This was, again, as far as the world was concerned, that was his property.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   But Paul is saying, not to receive him as your former slave, but as your brother in
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.240]   Christ.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.880]   What Paul was asking Philemon to do, was humanly speaking, was not something that they could
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.040]   have understood.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.400]   Why would you receive him as your brother?
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.720]   Let him live.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.160]   At least beat him, and then sell him off, because that's what would have typically
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   happened.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.400]   So this whole scenario in this letter could not have happened if it wasn't for the power
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.820]   of the cross.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.040]   The witness of what Christ has done, his death and resurrection, wasn't in the teaching
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   of theology, going back and forth, getting in a classroom, and here's a set of doctrine
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.960]   that you need to memorize.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.760]   The power of the cross and the witness of Christ was in the life of the believers in
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   the early church.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.560]   A Jew and a Gentile slave and a slave owner, Pharisees sitting with Gentiles breaking bread,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   even as he is being threatened with life, he's sitting in prison, thanking God for
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   the opportunity to preach the gospel.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.280]   None of this could have happened by human will.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.800]   It was the power of the cross.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.000]   At the core of all of this, that's driving this, is the love of Christ.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   That's what Paul is using to plead with Philemon to receive him back.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.720]   He says, "Remember what Christ has done for you.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   Remember who you are.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.320]   Remember the mercy that Christ has shown you, and I encourage you to respond also in mercy
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.440]   to receive this runaway slave back."
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.080]   See, Philemon, verse 4 through 7, Paul says, "I thank my God always when I remember you
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.040]   in my prayers, because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.840]   Lord Jesus and of all the saints."
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.000]   So in other words, he's saying, "I know who you are, and there's genuine evidence of your
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.640]   salvation and your faith because of the love that I already see you practicing among the
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   brothers."
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.760]   And then he says, "And I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.120]   full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ."
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.120]   Now this is one of those passages that sometimes we memorize to encourage evangelism.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.600]   I'm praying that you would share your faith and become effective in all the knowledge
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.720]   and good things that God has given you.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.400]   But again, every verse has to be understood in the context of the letter and context of
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   the New Testament.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.040]   The word for sharing here is koinonia.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.080]   So it doesn't exclude evangelism, but the meaning behind it is much broader and much
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.320]   larger than just sharing and evangelizing.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.160]   He's referencing this communion that he has with his brothers and sisters because of what
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.660]   Christ has done in his life.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.660]   Sharing of his faith.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.280]   In other words, practicing this love that Christ showed him.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   And he's using that as a base to say, "Because Christ loved you, now you love to the extent
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.160]   this runaway slave who took everything from you."
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.200]   And then he says, "I want you to practice this love out of abundance of your heart because
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.540]   you're being affected by the love of Christ.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.760]   But just in case that's not enough, don't forget you owe me your life.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.260]   I share the gospel with you."
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.380]   At the core of who we are, we are people who have been affected by the love of Christ.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.380]   That's who we are.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.340]   It wasn't just, you know, we heard a bunch of doctrines that say, "You know what?
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.960]   I think this makes more sense to me."
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.080]   If that is your testimony, it's just in your head, you've chosen what makes the most sense
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.460]   to you, that's probably what will be reflected in your life.
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:09.380]   Mentally, you know all the right things, but the aroma of Christ isn't evident in your
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   life.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.700]   See, Christianity is not simply about laying out the right doctrines and choosing what
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.180]   you think is right.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:27.100]   Christianity ultimately is about encountering the resurrected Christ and being transformed.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.260]   That's what Christianity is.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.700]   Knowing this resurrected Christ, and as He loved us, we love.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.300]   That's exactly what the Scripture says.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.180]   We love because He first loved us.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.100]   People who have been affected by the love of Christ, practicing that love with other
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.980]   people, ultimately.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.380]   The text that we're looking at this morning in verse 12, again, it's in the line of series
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.300]   about 21 to 24 imperatives, that this is what you ought to do.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.420]   And He started by saying, "Let your love be genuine, or poor, what is evil.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.940]   Love one another, brotherly affection."
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.780]   And He basically establishes love as the first priority, and then He goes on and He begins
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.260]   to build imperative by imperative.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.380]   He doesn't explain, He doesn't go into deep exposition of what it means to persevere,
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.420]   what it means to go through trials.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.020]   But one by one, He goes and He kind of knocks out.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.900]   It's not comprehensive.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.880]   There's a lot more that He could have added to this, but every single one of these highlight
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.580]   and accentuates what it means to be people who have been affected by the love of Christ
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.900]   and to continue to persevere in it.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.620]   So our outline in verse 12 is pretty clear.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.260]   The first one, He says, "Biblical love rejoices in hope."
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.660]   Biblical love rejoices in hope.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:49.620]   The first thing that we see in any genuine conversion, if you've ever participated in
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.060]   sharing the gospel and seeing somebody come to Christ, whether you share the gospel or
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:01.980]   you participated in it or you were near it, the very first evidence of genuine faith and
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.500]   genuine conversion is joy.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.900]   How do you determine if somebody is alive, physically living or not?
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.420]   We check their breath.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.720]   We check their pulse and we see, "Oh, is this person really living?"
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.480]   As a Christian, when somebody who was at one point dead in their trespasses, and because
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.400]   of the blood of Christ, they become alive in Christ, the very first thing that we see
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.680]   is that very life, because that's what salvation is.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.460]   Dead person coming to life.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.300]   Jesus says, "I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly."
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:44.140]   So you would think that you would be able to see this life in a brand new Christian.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.660]   If somebody was dead and they came to life, you'd be able to say, "I'm not sure.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.060]   I don't know if that person is alive."
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.940]   The word for life in the Bible is zoe, not bios.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.560]   Bios is where you use the word for chronological length of life.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.420]   Jesus did not say that, "I have come to give you extended period of living, that when you
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.460]   die that you don't get terminated, but that you're going to exist forever."
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.460]   That's not what he said.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:18.960]   He said, "I have come to give you life, zoe, to make you alive and to make you alive abundantly."
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.820]   Not just you weren't breathing and then you're breathing.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.420]   Not just you weren't thinking and then now you're thinking, but he says, "No, to make
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:31.300]   you alive and to make you alive abundantly, exponentially."
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:38.700]   That's why the scripture says in Galatians 5, 22 to 23, the fruit of the spirit is first,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.860]   the fruit of the spirit in 522, but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, kindness,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.060]   goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.900]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.860]   And of these nine characteristics of the fruit of the spirit, what's the first one?
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.420]   Love.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.100]   And then the second one?
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.100]   Joy.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.100]   Right?
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.740]   Now, I've already mentioned to you many times that whenever you see a list of things in
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.720]   the Bible, especially in the New Testament, that it is not random.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.020]   He didn't have nine different things and he just went into a bag and whatever came up,
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.020]   he listed it.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.440]   It's very purposeful.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.640]   So the fact that the very first fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, because it's love that
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.900]   brought Christ down.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.360]   It is love that caused him to forgive sinners.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.440]   It is love that caused him to sacrifice who he knew no sin became sin, that you and I
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.160]   may have the righteousness of Christ.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   It was love.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.340]   And so the very first thing that he says, "If Christ is in you," the very first thing
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.140]   that you would see is love.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.460]   And then the second thing is joy, this very life that he came to give.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:48.760]   So the evidence of true faith is this joy.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.820]   You can't have worship if you don't have life.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.900]   If our life is constantly characterized by grumbling and complaining, it squashes the
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.280]   joy that God gave us to make us alive.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.840]   You know, if you ever talk to somebody and there's some people in our lives and all they
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.560]   talk about is what is wrong with life and what's wrong with everybody else, and you
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.040]   don't even know if they really have any kind of relationship with Christ, because all they
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.960]   know is what's wrong with everybody, with everything.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.320]   See, the very first characteristic, he says, is this joy, is this life in us.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.800]   And it affects everything that we do.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.900]   And see, we have this joy not because of circumstances, and this is not the kind of joy that you experience
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:40.000]   because you got a raise, you know, or you won the lottery, or you found this great pizza
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.280]   place that no one else found, and you feel this temporary joy.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.520]   We're talking about a joy that cannot be squashed.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.280]   First Peter 1, 3 to 6, Peter says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:58.400]   According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope."
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.820]   Not a hope that is alive one day and dead the next day.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.720]   Not a kind of hope that you have to keep going after over and over and seeking different things.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   He said it is a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.520]   Not only is it living, he says, this inheritance, this hope that we have in Christ, it is imperishable,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.840]   undefiled, and unfading.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   It does not fade.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   And this is exactly what he meant.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.360]   If you drink of the water of the world, you may quench your thirst for a minute, but the
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.640]   minute will pass.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.000]   It may satisfy you for a period, but eventually it passes, and you have to have it over and
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   over and over again.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.680]   But he said, the water I give you, if you drink of it, you will never thirst.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.880]   The bread that I give you, it won't satisfy you for a period.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   He said you will never go hungry again.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.860]   He said it is imperishable.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:56.720]   How much of your joy is based upon perishable things?
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.080]   When somebody is nice to you, joy.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.640]   When they're not, you're not joyful anymore.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.480]   A lot of times people base their commitment to a church based upon temporary joy.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.280]   If I have friends, you know, I say, oh, this is great because people are great.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.240]   And as soon as that gets tainted or somebody says something or the fellowship gets sour
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.000]   and your whole relationship with God falls apart.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.520]   It is imperishable.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.680]   It can't be defiled.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.320]   No sin, nothing can defile this hope that we have in Christ.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.240]   We didn't earn it, and we can't defile it.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.280]   It is unfading.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.400]   It doesn't disappear as time goes by, just like everything else in this world.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.800]   No matter how excited you get about your brand new car, brand new relationship, brand new
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.600]   car, whatever it is that you get, it's eventually it fades.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   Everything fades.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.800]   He said, but this hope that we have in Christ is unfading.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.440]   Not only is it imperishable, not only it can't be defiled, not only does it not fade and
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.760]   it continues, but the power of God guards it in our faith until the end.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.120]   It is in his hands, not mine, not yours, not the church's.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:16.400]   And the only reason why the church has persevered up to this point, after 2,000 years of corruption
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:24.040]   and sinfulness and selfishness and politics and even wars, if you look at it and examine
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:30.320]   every single church, every single church, there is some problem.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.640]   And these aren't minor problems.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.400]   Every single church that I'm able to visit, including our church, there is something that
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   you can find.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.720]   If you want to take a closer look, there's something that you can find saying, man, this
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.580]   church is not going to make it.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.200]   And yet we're here 2,000 years later, especially if you look at the Catholic Church for 1,000
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.160]   years of teaching the wrong gospel, for killing people, for wanting to translate the Bible
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.000]   so that people can read it.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.880]   And yet we're still here with hundreds of translations.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.760]   And the only reason why you and I are here is because it is being guarded by the power
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.200]   of God, not me, not you.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.480]   Not because faithful men have, with courage, just kind of stood.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.040]   I mean, God uses all of that, but in the end, it's not because of that.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.880]   Because God said that this living hope that he gave to us, that is imperishable, undefiled,
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.040]   unfading, is being kept in his power until the end.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.700]   He's going to fulfill what he has promised.
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:35.840]   So our joy is based upon that living hope, which doesn't change when you first got saved
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.640]   and then five years later, or it was exciting in college, but then when you got married,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   it disappeared.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.680]   Or in your 20s, yes, but not after you have kids.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.400]   He says, "In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.960]   been grieved by various trials."
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.240]   It is in this that you rejoice.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.040]   So the life that he has given us does not shift because of circumstance.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:07.980]   It does not shift because of the people around us, or politics, or whatever is happening
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.380]   around us far and near.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.440]   It is in his hands.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.680]   And this hope that we have in Christ that produces this joy is directly an evidence
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.840]   of our genuine faith.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.680]   Hebrews 11, it says, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.800]   things not seen."
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:34.000]   If you don't have genuine faith, hope is just wishful thinking.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.200]   It's not real.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.480]   You're just, you don't really believe it, but you're just buying insurance just in case.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.320]   And so you won't see the fruit of it in your life.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.860]   But if you have genuine saving faith, the immediate outcome, immediate fruit is this
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:57.440]   hope that we have in Christ that we can't see or taste or touch, but we know that because
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.560]   I believe what he has told me, that I live my life and everything I do is affected by
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   that.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   What I invest in.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   What I rejoice in.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.560]   What I get saddened over.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.200]   It is all affected by this hope that we have in Christ.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   And it's a direct evidence of our faith.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.520]   First Peter 1, 8-9, "Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:22.160]   Though you do not see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.040]   and filled with glory."
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.880]   The obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your soul.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.080]   Do you notice that?
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.760]   How the outcome of our faith is directly linked to this inexpressible joy.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.200]   Because that's what the Bible says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.680]   begotten son that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have what?
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.680]   Everlasting life."
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   Zoe!
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   Joy!
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.740]   That's the whole purpose of our salvation.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.000]   So it doesn't make sense for Christians to be walking around.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.560]   Every day pointing out what's wrong with everything when we recognize that the greatest
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.040]   problem of mankind has been solved in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.360]   The worst case scenario that I can think of in my life, you know, of most people is just
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   dying early.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   Right?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.960]   What if we do this and we try everything to try to prolong our life.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:27.160]   But I think about the worst case scenario for me is, humanly speaking, is dying before
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.080]   my time and leaving my family and who's going to take care of my kids.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.960]   And I think of, just like any other human being, I think about these things.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.600]   But when I take a step back and think about it, the worst case scenario for Christians
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.440]   to die early means to go to Christ earlier.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   That's the worst case scenario.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.400]   And then you go, "Well, what about your children?"
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.840]   You know, I wrestle all the time with the, you know, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.120]   and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.800]   So I struggle with, "Well, who's going to take care of my kids?"
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.840]   And every decision I make and everything I do, I'm trying to like balance between putting
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.560]   God first and taking care of them.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.960]   Well, if I die early, He's forcing me to trust Him.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.160]   Right?
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.560]   That's the worst case scenario for a Christian.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.520]   We get diseased and we go bankrupt and it forces us to come to Him and beg for His mercy
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.360]   and then He draws near to me.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.320]   That's the worst case scenario for a Christian.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:28.920]   This joy that we have in Christ can only be squashed if you take your eyes off of Christ
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.800]   and you forget what it is that you have in Him.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:37.240]   Otherwise, it is, it says it is unfading, it is imperishable, it is kept in heaven for
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.120]   us.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.320]   And that first part of joy and hope is directly linked to the second part.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.200]   True love is patient in tribulation.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   Patient in tribulation.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.840]   In Matthew 13, 20 to 21, you're talking about the third seed that receives the word and
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.560]   it says immediately He's joyful.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.960]   So Matthew 13, 20 to 21.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.880]   As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   receives it with joy.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   So when you look at that part, it looks like, "Well, He must have genuine faith because
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.160]   immediately He receives it with joy."
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.680]   So there's evidence of His life.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   Yet, in verse 21, He has no root in Himself, but He endures for a while and when tribulation
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   persecution arises in account of the word, immediately He falls away.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:32.000]   So in other words, He is expressing, there's evidence of this joy superficially, but the
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.040]   reason why it gets squashed is because He has no root.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.640]   And where is this root?
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   What does the scripture say?
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.080]   If you do not abide in me, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:50.360]   So here's a man who superficially on the surface is happy, is rejoicing, but it's not because
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   of Christ.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.720]   I mean, don't we see that all the time?
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.200]   You can go to short-term missions and come back excited.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:05.240]   And as soon as that experience of being around Christians and your friends and having a sense
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.600]   of purpose, and as soon as that disappears, your joy disappears.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.480]   You get a new job and it's, "Oh, thank God."
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.240]   And we always talk about, "Thank God that He gave me.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   God is so wonderful.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   God is so good."
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.440]   And then as soon as you start having problems at work, your joy gets squashed.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.640]   You find a group of friends, maybe at a new church, and it's like, well, you're starting
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.920]   to connect that, "Wow, these people are really encouraging."
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.360]   And it's, "I love being here because there's a sense of purpose and I love this."
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.760]   And as soon as that gets squashed, your joy also gets squashed.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:41.240]   She says He's describing an individual who is experiencing joy superficially, but it's
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.720]   not because of Christ.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.880]   He said when the tribulation comes, when persecution comes because of the Word, he immediately
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   gets squashed.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.480]   He has no understanding of this joy that the Bible talks about.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.480]   His joy is no different than the world.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.120]   It's just that you may find it in the church.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.240]   Just like in the church, you know, talk about how the world is trying to exalt themselves
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.680]   by making money.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.240]   You can see that in the church too.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.000]   That's why the church gets corrupt all the time.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.840]   You have people in the church trying to find this worldly life in the church.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.680]   And that's a description of this man in the third seal.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:25.440]   You have people in the church all the time who are looking for the world in the church.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:32.160]   He says, "No, but the tribulation, when it comes, it reveals our genuine faith."
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:39.040]   1 Peter 4, 13-14, he says, "But rejoice insofar as you share in Christ's suffering, that you
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.280]   may also rejoice and be glad when His glory is revealed.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.600]   If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.480]   and of God rests upon you."
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.440]   How often do we read articles about the Christians who are being persecuted in Iran or Afghanistan,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:02.680]   North Korea, or maybe even in India, and we say, "Oh, those poor Christians."
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.520]   Thank God, God has blessed us to be living in a country where we don't have to worry
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.520]   about that.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:15.160]   When was the last time we looked at the intense persecution that's happening in Yemen, in
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.400]   Afghanistan, in Iran, in India, in China, and all over the world, and say, "Wow, I envy
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.880]   these people."
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   And yet that's the biblical perspective.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:32.640]   The biblical perspective is, he says, "Rejoice, because that persecution over your faith means
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.560]   that you are blessed."
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:41.520]   In fact, in Philippians chapter 129, it says, "For it has been granted to you that for the
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.440]   sake of Christ that you should not only believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake."
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.560]   It's been granted to you.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.120]   God doesn't look at the persecution happening around the world and say, "Oh my gosh, they're
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.440]   doing this to my children.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.920]   I've lost control."
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:04.680]   He says, "No, it's been granted to them that through these trials that they may also share
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.320]   in this intimacy with Christ."
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.880]   If the greatest gift of salvation is not to live forever, but Christ, because Christ is
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.200]   the author of our life.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:24.520]   If He's the author of life, and the greatest gift for any human being is Christ Himself,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:31.560]   then as Christians, wouldn't anything and everything that brings us closer to Christ
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.440]   be the greatest gift?
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.440]   Let me say that again.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.920]   If Christ is the greatest gift of salvation, if it's the greatest gift that any human being
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.000]   can have, because He is the originator of life, and He's the author of life, He's the
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:56.360]   sustainer of life, and all hope hinges upon Him, then anything and everything that brings
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:02.440]   us closer to Christ, isn't that the greatest gift?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.200]   When we evaluate what is happening in our life based upon the wishes and hopes of this
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.600]   world, then anything that hinders us from getting more money, anything that hinders
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.660]   us from safety, anything that hinders us from being loved by people that we care about,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.520]   we don't look at that as a blessing.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:26.080]   But when our perspective changes biblically based upon what He sees, sometimes the greatest
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.800]   blessing that we receive is the brokenness that you've experienced, and that brokenness
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.560]   that led you to repentance, to come to Christ.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.160]   That's the greatest thing that happened in your life.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   The greatest tragedy that you may have experienced, the greatest heartache, because that brought
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.320]   you to Christ.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.280]   That caused you to long for Him.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.100]   That created a hunger in your heart that would not have been there if God didn't allow this
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   in your life.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:59.400]   So He says not only that He caused us to persevere, He said it's been granted to you.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.960]   See, this is something that the world that does not know Christ will never understand.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.760]   No matter how much we try to explain it to them, if they have not seen the glory of the
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.920]   gospel of Jesus Christ, if they don't understand the hope that we have in His name, this will
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.160]   make absolutely no sense.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.720]   In fact, they'll think you're ludicrous.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.800]   They'll think you're insane for celebrating tribulation.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.720]   In Romans 5, 3 to 5, it says, "More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.080]   suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.640]   what?
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.600]   Hope."
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:42.320]   Tribulation ultimately brings us to greater hope in Christ.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.280]   And it is this hope that we have in Christ that causes us to long for Him, to hunger
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.500]   and thirst for righteousness, that desire Him more than desiring of this world.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:57.920]   So when trials and tribulations come into our life, it reminds us this is not our home.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.260]   This is not our home.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:07.760]   And isn't the frustration and the trials that you have in life as a Christian, because we're
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:17.680]   trying so hard, every decision that we make is trying to have what the world has and have
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.400]   Jesus too.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.840]   Isn't that where our frustration lies?
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   See, tribulation comes into our life because He grants it, because He's trying to draw
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.180]   us to Himself.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:39.460]   The third commandment is also vitally linked to the second part.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.100]   Biblical love is constant in prayer.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.740]   It is constant in prayer.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:49.180]   Hebrews 4.16, it says, "Let us then, with confidence, draw near to the throne of grace
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:55.740]   that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:02.220]   The greatest and the most practical gift that we have been given because of our salvation
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.220]   is prayer.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:10.100]   I want you to really let that sink in, right?
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.860]   Because the curse of man came onto mankind because we've been separated from God, that
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.880]   we didn't have access to this Holy God.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.580]   So everything about Israel's history was to teach the nation of Israel that a Holy
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.180]   God cannot dwell with sinful man.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:31.020]   So everything that we're learning in the book of Leviticus, it's not welcoming.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.940]   I mean, if you've ever studied or read through the book of Leviticus, it's not welcoming.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.180]   It doesn't say, "Come."
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.820]   It actually screams every chapter to stay away, or you shall die.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.780]   You know, we're learning through all these sacrificial systems, and by the time he's
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.160]   done with his teaching, we're going to get to chapter 10.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.280]   And then when we get to chapter 10, they actually start to practice this.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.800]   And then I'm giving you a preview of what's coming in chapter 10.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.720]   The very first time the nation of Israel tries to implement it, and they do it incorrectly,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.280]   do you know what happens?
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.200]   They die.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.580]   The first two priests.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:16.420]   So nothing about this sacrificial system invites people to come to him, because he was trying
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.980]   to teach the nation of Israel.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:24.660]   The sinners cannot be in the presence of a Holy God and live.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:29.020]   And that's why it was preparation for the coming of Christ, that he's going to cover
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:35.020]   you so that you can come, because the whole blessing of life is to be near his presence.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.500]   If the living water is in him, I have to get to him.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.980]   If my sustenance is coming from him, I have to get to him.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.260]   But we couldn't get to him because of our sins.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.620]   That's the whole point of the sacrificial system.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.980]   Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sin.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   What goat though?
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.360]   What bull?
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   What pigeon?
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.140]   What lamb would have been big enough?
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.860]   What animal would have sufficed to do away with all of my sins?
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.340]   All of the nation's sins?
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.420]   Past, present, or future.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:13.300]   Even as they were practicing these things, they should have been asking themselves, "Really?
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.620]   This Holy God that we can't even look at?
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.700]   That this one little tiny animal is going to suffice for that?"
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.700]   Obviously it did not.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.740]   It was only to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.020]   So the greatest gift that we have received because of the blood of Christ, he took away
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:36.060]   this barrier between sinners and the Holy God, so that we can have this access.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.300]   And so when Hebrews 4.16 says, "Now you can draw near with confidence that you're not
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:49.320]   going to get killed, not only just gazing at him, but to be in his presence."
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:55.580]   So the greatest gift that you and I have been given is the ability to be able to pray, to
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.860]   ask him.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.300]   If you abide in me, my word abide in you.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.340]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:08.340]   But the reason why, especially in the Western church, why prayer is so impotent, it's because
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.340]   of the latter part.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:15.580]   It says that you may find and receive mercy and find grace to help in what?
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.900]   In time of need.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.420]   That's the problem.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.580]   The church does pray when we are in dire need.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.620]   We pray when we are sick.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.060]   We pray when we lose our job.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.580]   We pray during disasters.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.700]   We pray when we feel absolutely helpless.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.700]   But that's our problem.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.860]   How often do you feel helpless?
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.420]   How often do you come before God in dire need?
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:52.660]   How often do we recognize that we need him and that we run to him in prayer?
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:57.700]   So sometimes God will bring tribulations from time to time to remind us of our need for
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.700]   him.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:05.260]   You know, the Iranian pastor was asked about the increase in persecution that's happening
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.020]   in Iran.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.380]   And they asked him, "How did you see this persecution affect Christianity in Iran?"
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.900]   This is what he said.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:18.460]   The church, the Iranian church, used to be a sleepy church because there was so much
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.940]   prosperity and so many foreigners living in Iran.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:28.540]   Today, referring to Iranian Christians, went from sleepy once a month members to a church
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.140]   on its knees.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.960]   God brought persecution in that church and purified the church.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.660]   And through that purification, right now, the greatest, at least in modern history,
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.660]   of Muslims turning to Christ is happening in Iran.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:48.140]   They said that the number of people from Muslims, nominal Muslims who are turning to Christianity,
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.660]   is in record number that they haven't seen until in modern history.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:58.700]   And it was because God brought suffering and the suffering led to dire need in prayer.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.380]   But here's the challenge.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.740]   What about us living in Orange County?
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.460]   Well, we're not being persecuted.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.300]   Do we cause trouble on purpose?
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.940]   Do we invite this persecution?
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.260]   I mean, because we're living in peace.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:18.460]   I mean, obviously, you know, I'd rather have my kids living in peace.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:23.180]   I'd rather have worship, not worrying about somebody coming and blowing us up.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.020]   So how do we fight this?
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:35.340]   The scripture clearly says, in Ephesians chapter 610, we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.340]   but against rulers.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.980]   Let me stop right there.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:44.420]   Part of the reason why we don't pray is because we forget this.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.860]   We wrestle against flesh and blood.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:52.700]   And so much of sometimes even Christian work is fighting against flesh and blood.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.660]   If we have the right programs, if we have the right discipleship, if we say the right
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.940]   things and organize the right things, if we have the right people in place.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:06.020]   If our fight is against flesh and blood, then flesh and blood is the answer.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.580]   Having the right people, right organization, right method.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:14.940]   If flesh and blood is our problem, but he said it's not our flesh and blood.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.500]   Christian battle is not about flesh and blood.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.900]   It's against rulers, against authorities, against the cosmic powers, against the present
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.180]   dark age, against the spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.980]   So over and over and over and over and over again, he reminds us, it is not flesh and
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.980]   blood.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:38.580]   This battle that we're in is against powerful spiritual beings.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:46.060]   You can have the best organization, the best theology, the best preaching, all the money
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:54.780]   in the world, and all the knowledge in the world, and be absolutely fruitless.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.380]   And be absolutely helpless.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.220]   There's no amount of money, there's no amount of effort, there's no amount of intellect,
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.940]   there's no amount of organization that's going to make us successful against this battle.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.700]   Because he said it's not flesh and blood.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.740]   In fact, he says over and over again, he says it is against, against, over and over again,
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.360]   he says against rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic power, against the spiritual
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.900]   forces in heavenly places.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:22.900]   Against, against, against, against.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:30.300]   In other words, he reminds us, there's a conflict, that you are in the context of battle.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.500]   And it is not only in Iran, it is not only in Afghanistan, it is here.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:40.940]   And the danger that you and I live in is we don't know that we are in this battle.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:46.460]   That there is spiritual forces who are actively going against us, and he is scheming your
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:52.660]   thoughts, your heart, your worship, your fellowship, is being hindered constantly, and we are unaware.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:59.020]   And we are unaware of the spiritual need that we have to come before God and cling to him
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.060]   and beg for his help.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.820]   And so we do not recognize that we are in need.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.540]   So we have this access that is open to God, but because we do not feel the need, we don't
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.620]   go to him.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.260]   Because I can pay my bills without Christ.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.580]   I know how to raise my kids.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.220]   I know how to organize.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.420]   I know how to invest for the future.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.540]   I know how to take money out and put it in a stock that is going to grow.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.660]   I know how to do all of that, but we don't need Christ for that.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:34.580]   But when we recognize the spiritual battle that we are going against, no amount of your
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.940]   money, no amount of your experience, no amount of hard work is going to make a dent in that.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.580]   And this spiritual battle oftentimes is not even external.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:52.700]   It's in you, your thoughts, your hatred, your selfishness, your unwillingness to forgive,
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.220]   unwillingness to be gracious.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.420]   That spiritual battle is also in you.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.820]   It is not just external.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.820]   It's because we don't recognize that.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:07.220]   The people who are not absolutely committed to holiness have no idea how desperate they
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:14.020]   are, how they cannot be holy without the love of Christ.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:21.500]   Those of you who have never fully committed to love as Christ loved, you have no idea
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.460]   how far that is from you to practice.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.380]   We're not talking about love like Valentine love that we had this Wednesday.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:33.020]   You know, go to Costco and you have all these men who are buying flowers to make up for
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.260]   the rest of the year, you know what I mean?
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:41.100]   Trying to be a good husband or could be a good father or good son or a good wife.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.780]   The whole world practices that.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.180]   It's not just the Christians that was there on the Valentine's Day.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.220]   Hindus and atheists, they're all there.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.660]   We're all trying to be good fathers.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.260]   We're all trying to be good brothers.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.820]   We're all trying to be good husbands and wives.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.180]   That's not what he called us to be.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:02.140]   He says, "As I have loved you, if you love one another, they will know that you are my
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.660]   disciples."
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.500]   God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   for us.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.700]   Where he ran when he saw our sin, to us, not from us.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:21.140]   So the love that he called us to love is a love that you and I do not have within us.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:28.780]   Anything smells weird, it sounds weird, people act weird, we see selfishness in other people.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.900]   I mean, we don't want to, life is too short, I don't want to deal with that.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.340]   Life is hard enough as it is.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:43.100]   And yet, the very core of what he called us to be is to reflect the love of Christ.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:50.060]   If you've ever made a commitment to love as Christ loved, you know how desperate you
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.940]   are.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.940]   You know that it's not within you.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.660]   Only people that is not aware of that is a person who's never really committed to that.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:04.540]   This knee-jerk reaction to run the other way when you see sin in other people.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.020]   There are periods, and I'm sure every one of us can remember, there are periods in our
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.700]   life where God has brought certain things and you prayed.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:17.900]   I can remember maybe about four or five times as an adult, I'm desperately on my knees praying.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:22.820]   There are periods, stretches of periods, when I couldn't pay the bills and had small children
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.300]   in the house and waking up in the middle of the night just praying to God.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.180]   You know, I prayed fervently.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.500]   I remember when Esther was pregnant with our second child and it looked like it was going
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.060]   to have another miscarriage.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.180]   And I remember waking up early in the morning, going to morning prayer and praying and praying
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.180]   and praying.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.580]   So, there are stretches I can think of, but eventually it passes.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.300]   No matter how hard the trials or sickness, eventually a year, six months, a couple years,
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.980]   eventually it passes.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:45:02.900]   But the trial that keeps me on my knees day in and day out, year after year, is to love
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:09.020]   sinners as Christ loved me.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.720]   And the more I commit to that, the more I get broken.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:20.580]   If you ever try to love people the way Christ loved us, there's nothing more draining, nothing
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:29.860]   more humiliating, nothing more difficult, nothing that calls you more to die to yourself.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:36.820]   Because at the very core of our rebellion against God is self-exaltation, self-gratification,
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.740]   self-preservation.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:46.640]   So a sinner opposes that because he's self-glorifying, he's self-preserving.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:53.020]   So two sinners who are together opposes the very core of my rebellion against God.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:46:00.260]   So nothing challenges the core of my rebellion than to love a sinner.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:05.860]   And yet God calls us to draw near to sinners, and there's nothing that glorifies God, nothing
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:13.700]   that declares the aroma of Christ more than when people see that love in us.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.820]   And that causes us to pray.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.980]   That causes us to pray.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:24.700]   It gets us on our knees to cry out to God, begging for Him, because I can't change my
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.420]   own heart.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.540]   I can't just turn this off.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:34.260]   I can't just tell somebody that I don't like and say, "I'm going to like you today."
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.980]   I can't just have bitterness that's been stored in my heart and say, "I'm just going to turn
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.220]   it off.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.580]   I'm just not going to do it.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.200]   I don't have any power to do that."
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   So it makes me desperate.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:51.180]   It makes me in need to come before God, "Help me, God.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.600]   Change me.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.900]   Take this away from me."
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.460]   And it is constant until the day we die.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.720]   He's going to keep us on our knees.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.220]   I want to encourage and challenge us as I wrap up this morning's sermon.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:15.820]   Paul, again, you know, like his—I know, like, this is the Word of God, you know, and
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.580]   it's always encouraging, always challenging.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.580]   But the older I get, the more I appreciate this man.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.940]   You know, an apostle.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.140]   Obviously, he's an apostle, so we should be appreciative.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.420]   Just the depth of what this man experienced.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.300]   This guy lost everything in light of Christ.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.300]   He's sitting in prison.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.560]   He's writing this epistle to the Philippians.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.820]   And usually when we think of Philippians, we think of the epistle of joy.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.820]   He's sitting in prison.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.340]   He's chained to a Roman guard, and he's worried about their joy.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.860]   And he's writing this letter, and this is one of my favorite verses.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:50.820]   In fact, it's probably my life verse, where he says, "For to me," Philippians 121,
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.680]   verse 24, "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.940]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.140]   Yet which I shall choose, I cannot tell.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.000]   I am hard-pressed between the two.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.860]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:10.560]   But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account."
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.260]   You have to understand basically what Paul is saying.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.500]   Paul is saying, "I have this choice between living and dying."
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.980]   And to him, it's not hypothetical.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.300]   Like I can say that, but it's hypothetical.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.760]   I know I'm not going to die today.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.020]   This guy is literally, he could die.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.720]   And he says, "I'm weighing the two.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.260]   But if you were to ask me if I was selfish, I'm ready to go."
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.300]   And he's not just trying to be godly.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.280]   This guy lost everything because of Christ.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.660]   This guy was possibly a member of the Sanhedrin.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.680]   I mean, he was a celebrity in the Jewish community.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   He had money.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.880]   He had heritage with his father.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.740]   He lost it all because he met Christ.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.860]   And now he's going into cities, and as soon as they see him, they pick up rocks, try to
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.060]   stone him.
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.960]   Getting shipwrecked, going hungry, sitting in prison.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.900]   If that was not, I mean, the very people who looked up to him, they're the ones who are
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.900]   trying to beat him.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.260]   If that wasn't enough, he's concerned about these churches that he planted.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.340]   And every time he turns around, somebody's backsliding.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.220]   He's allowing sin into their churches.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.660]   And I mean, the most excruciating letter, 1 Corinthians 2, very people that he risked
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.740]   his life to bring the gospel, questioning this guy because they didn't like what he
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:24.740]   had to say.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.740]   "Oh, he was too harsh on us."
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.740]   See, he's not an apostle.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.300]   We don't have to listen to this guy.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:35.780]   And he's writing this gut-wrenching letter, trying to convince them, "It's not me.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   God is speaking to you.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.500]   I'm doing this on your behalf."
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:43.580]   And then the very last letter he writes, in 2 Timothy, he's pleading with this young disciple,
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.620]   "Don't let this happen to you.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.580]   Invest in the word that you have been given because all these people are falling away.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.060]   I'm here alone in jail.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.060]   Don't let this happen to you.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.060]   You persevere.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.260]   You preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.460]   And whether people want to hear or don't hear it, you make sure that you continue to
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.820]   do what God called you to do.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.760]   It's a gut-wrenching letter at the end of his life.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.500]   So when Paul says, "If you're going to ask me and you want me to be selfish, I want to
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:21.100]   go," it's Christ who saved me years ago that I've been preaching year after year.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.500]   And I'm just waiting to be delivered from this flesh.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.820]   He said, "I'm tired of my flesh.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.020]   I'm tired of my own selfishness.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.860]   I'm tired of the sin that I'm wrestling with.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.300]   I'm tired.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.380]   If you're asking me, I want to go.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:44.300]   But if I stay, if I stay, it means more fruit.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.460]   It means more people will be able to meet him.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.980]   More people will be able to come to him.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:56.500]   More people may know this Jesus that I have come to love."
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.940]   And that's the only reason that I know I'll stay.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:04.220]   I mean, this is a man who was burned out for Jesus Christ.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.340]   We use that term "burned out," I think wrong.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.460]   Burned out meant you worked so hard, you were so consumed.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.620]   I think the term that we should be using is we've rusted out.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.660]   Most of us get burned out because we're rusted out.
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.020]   We haven't been exercising.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.340]   We haven't been living in obedience.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.340]   We haven't been praying.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.380]   So you just, you have nothing more to burn, so we've rusted out.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:35.220]   But to be burned out for the very things that give you the greatest joy, isn't that the
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.260]   life that you want to live?
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:44.260]   Really think about that.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.820]   Don't you want to live?
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:56.820]   Not just dabble, not just go and eat some good food and ride some good rides and be
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.420]   secure because there's enough money in the bank.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.380]   Don't you want to live?
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:08.660]   Live, like really live.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:16.900]   And not only do you live, people around you live because of you.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.300]   Jesus said, "I have come to give life."
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:24.380]   And He gave it abundantly.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:32.380]   So my challenge for us this morning is that God would open all of our eyes.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:39.140]   See, genuinely see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:45.060]   That coming and running to Christ is not something that you even have to be determined to do.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:49.020]   Like the Samaritan woman, as soon as she met Christ, she dropped everything, forgot everything.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:57.260]   She went out to tell all the people, became the first evangelist, that that would be us.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.980]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus, the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:08.780]   Would you take some time to pray with me this morning as we invite?
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:13.060]   Our praise seemed to come up.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:24.260]   If you've been stuck in complacency and you've just been dabbling in the things of Christ,
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:31.780]   not realizing that that's the very reason why you are in the state that you are, that
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:37.500]   you've forgotten what it is that you have in Christ, that when you first met Him, what
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.660]   He meant to you.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:46.260]   Jesus said, "The kingdom of heaven is like the farmer who found the treasure in the land
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:52.060]   and went back and sold everything that he may have as treasure."
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.220]   That is this the Jesus that you know?
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.860]   Is this the kingdom that you are a part of?
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.500]   If not, let's come before the Lord in honest prayer.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:09.200]   I believe, but help my unbelief, that pursuing Christ, that He would help us to recognize
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.060]   our desperation without Him, that we would be fed in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.820]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads.
