[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, verses 18 through
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.560]   24.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.640]   We're going to be looking at verse 22 and on today, but I want to read it in the context
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   of verse 18 through 24.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.880]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.400]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, and to a blazing fire, and to
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.720]   the darkness and gloom and whirlwind, and to the blast of the trumpet and the sound
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.800]   of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.140]   to them.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.840]   For they could not bear the command, if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.760]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I am full of fear and trembling.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.480]   But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.360]   and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.560]   in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirit of the righteous made perfect,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.680]   and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the sprinkle blood which speaks better
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.040]   than the blood of Abel.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.560]   Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come before your throne
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.960]   of grace with confidence because of the blood of Christ.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.840]   We thank you, Father God, for loving us, persevering with us, and at times correcting us, disciplining
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.740]   us that we may know you, that we may honor you and worship you.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.080]   We pray that your word would go forth, only your word go forth, and that it would not
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.840]   return until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.960]   I think as you guys know, we are in wedding season, right?
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.760]   So we have so many weddings and we know some of you recently got married and we know that
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.120]   some of you just got engaged.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   There's weddings coming up.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.760]   In fact, just this week we had two weddings.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.780]   We had one here yesterday and then we had another one I think on Tuesday, and so our
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.880]   pastors are busy officiating weddings.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.720]   So, you know, through the years, I think in our church we have so many young people.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280]   We've had so many weddings and somebody asked me how many weddings have I officiated and
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.760]   actually sat down and counted, and it's been a while since I counted, but it's over 100
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.560]   and less than 150, so it was quite a few, right?
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.360]   And there's more weddings going on now than ever.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.200]   But sometimes, you know, when we have weddings, we get so caught up in the logistics of the
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.560]   wedding that by the time they get to the wedding ceremony, it's kind of like, "Let's get this
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   over with, you know?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.040]   Get this over with and then let's go to the honeymoon and enjoy ourselves," and they don't
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.200]   actually enjoy the ceremony, which is, you know, obviously nobody plans to do that, but
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.880]   they get caught up and they forget why they're getting married in the first place.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.480]   So through the years, I've observed, right?
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.240]   I've officiated weddings that probably cost less than a couple thousand, right?
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   And I've also officiated weddings where it costs almost half a million.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.040]   And so remembering all of those things, like the highlights, and whether it was an expensive
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.680]   wedding or whether it was an inexpensive wedding, there are certain things that I can look back
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.920]   and remember what made it memorable, right?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.520]   And there's a few things that I remember.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.720]   One, it's obvious that what makes a wedding memorable to me is that those two people wanted
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.360]   to be together.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   It sounds like, no duh, right?
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.240]   Why are they getting married?
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.840]   And so oftentimes, especially if you've been a Christian for a while, you have a Christian
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.000]   answer and then you have the real answer, right?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.480]   So you ask, "Why do you want to get married?"
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.000]   "For the glory of God."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   Like, "We want to produce and do God's work together," and so you kind of give a Christian
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.680]   answer, but the real honest reason is because she's pretty and he's good-looking, right?
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.440]   And there's something about each other that attracted you and you want to get married.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.280]   Nobody twisted your arm.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.400]   This was not an obligation.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.920]   If you want to honor God, you have to get married, right?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.760]   It's a choice you made because you'd rather be with that person and not to be with that
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   person.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.600]   So the obvious reason is because you want to.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.320]   And so, of course, everybody gets married for that purpose, but then they get caught
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.760]   up in the context of trying to get the logistics and the guest rights and the food and all
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   this stuff, and then you got the drama between the in-laws and like, "Who wants this?
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   Who doesn't want this?"
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   And by the time they get to the wedding, they completely forget about why they're getting
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.880]   married in the first place, right?
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.800]   "Let's get this over with.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   I'm so tired of this."
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.240]   And then they go to their honeymoon.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.100]   So the weddings that I remember where they just never lost focus and they're just so
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.920]   happy to be there and all the little things that didn't go right, it didn't bother them
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.220]   as much because they get to get married to the person that they want to get married to.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.680]   So that's one of the first things that I remember.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240]   The other part, especially for Christians, was a genuine worship, right?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.600]   Where every once in a while we'll have a situation where it's just, "Get this over with."
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.400]   You know, the real wedding is the party, like the reception.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.960]   We want to get to the reception so that we can celebrate, have good food, and so the
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.320]   ceremony itself is just kind of get it over with.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.800]   Keep the sermon as short as possible.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.320]   We don't want any frills, nothing.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   Just get it over with, right?
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   And then to get to that.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.000]   But the weddings that was truly memorable were where the bride and groom came in really
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.120]   wanting to worship God.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.720]   And you can see, and then that's kind of like a catalyst for the wedding party to worship.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.840]   And then it really felt like worship in the context of the wedding ceremony.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   And I've had non-Christians who are witness to.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.800]   That's why one of the things that when I officiate weddings, I want to make sure that the gospel
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.480]   is clearly presented, is because I've had so many non-Christians come to me after a
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.720]   worship ceremony, because they've never been to worship.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.760]   They've never been to church.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.080]   And they can't pinpoint exactly what it is, but they knew that this was something that
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.640]   they're missing.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.200]   You know, if non-Christians fell short of the glory of God, that's the primary thing
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.560]   that they're not able to do.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.040]   And so at least being in the midst of the celebration, they noticed that this is something
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.360]   that was beautiful that they're not able to participate in.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.040]   And so genuine worship, that you don't get so caught up in the logistics that you forget
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.480]   that this is a worship before God.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.400]   Before we ask for blessings of family and friends, that we're asking for God's blessing.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   And that was at the center.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   And then the third, the final thing I remember about what was memorable to me was the gathering
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.960]   of people who were there to truly celebrate together.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.560]   You know, I've been to weddings where, you know, the parents are very influential, and
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.240]   they have so many friends.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.560]   And the wedding has like five, six, seven hundred people, and more than half, or maybe
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.600]   two-thirds are guests from parents.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.000]   And so some of them come because they genuinely saw you grow up and want to participate.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.440]   Some of them come out of obligation, right?
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.480]   Oh, he came to my wedding, so I have to invite them to our wedding.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.440]   So they gave a hundred, I'll give a hundred.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.520]   And so they have a lot of that dynamic going on.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.280]   And in order to not be cussed out, they get the honored seats in the front, and then the
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.400]   friends get the back seat.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.040]   And then they go through the motion, and they feed them, and then they leave.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   They're the first ones to leave because they've shown their face, given their gift, they've
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.120]   eaten, they're gone.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.320]   And then they wait until their friends in the back, you know, "Hey, can you come to
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.240]   the front so we can start this real ceremony?"
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   You know?
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   And so I've been to weddings like that where they're just kind of like appeasing people
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.760]   who are there, but just not genuinely celebrating what's happening.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.480]   And so those are the three things that stand out to me, like what was memorable to a wedding.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.800]   So husband and wife, they're there, and they, like, that's their focus.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.160]   They really are happy that they're getting married.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.240]   And two, worship was at the center.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.280]   And third, there was a genuine celebration of what's going on.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.240]   Now all of this is connected to the text that we're looking at because Mount Zion is described
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.560]   as a celebration.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.000]   If you look at Hebrews chapter 12, 22, in the NASB, it doesn't really flesh out the
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.440]   meaning behind it because it just says it's an assembly of myriads of angels, a general
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.200]   assembly.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.160]   That word "general assembly" has more significance than what it says in the NASB.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.780]   NASB is just literally, if you translate it, that's what it means.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.840]   But if you look at the ESV, and I'm going to also read the NASB, it says this, "But
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.500]   you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.060]   and to innumerable angels in festal gathering."
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.160]   And then in Hebrews 12, 22, NIV, "But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.480]   the city of the living God.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.120]   You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly."
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   Do you notice what's different between the NASB and the NIV and the ESV?
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   Did you catch that?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.640]   In the NASB, it just says "general assembly."
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.600]   It just seems like, you know what I mean, you're having a town hall meeting or you're
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.540]   getting together, we're going to clean the church, everybody assemble, right?
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.320]   We're having a, you know, a members meeting after this, so that's also an assembly, general
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   assembly.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.260]   The meaning behind this is actually fleshed out in the ESV and NIV.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.800]   It's not just any gathering.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   It is a celebration.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.120]   That's why it's called a "festal gathering."
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.640]   That is why it's called, again in NIV, a "joyful assembly."
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.200]   So the description here is more akin to like a wedding ceremony, where there is an assembly,
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.820]   but the assembly is for the purpose of celebration.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.200]   And that's how Zion is described here.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.600]   It is not just an assembly.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.720]   It's not just people, you know, we saved you from eternal damnation, so we're just going
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.600]   to, everybody who's not condemned, just gather here.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.200]   It's described as a joyful assembly.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.720]   In fact, the word for gospel, right, what is the Greek word for gospel?
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.840]   Euangelion.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.640]   And what is the meaning of that word, euangelion?
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.160]   Good news.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.600]   When we use the term "good news," we apply it to pretty much everything, right?
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.000]   They're having a half-off sale at some boba shop.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.320]   That's good news, right?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.040]   Or you get let go of a ticket.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.040]   That's good news.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.320]   So we use the term "good news" for anything good.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.300]   But the word "good news" here in euangelion, culturally was a very specific word.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.720]   It wasn't just something that was good versus bad.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:56.400]   That word, culturally, was specifically used to convey to us the meaning of the gospel.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.880]   Culturally, it was not the only way it was used, but one of the primary ways that it
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:09.160]   was used was when the soldiers of your country went to war, and people are eagerly waiting
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.440]   to see who won.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.920]   Because if the soldiers representing your nation to protect and to fight for you, if
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.840]   they lost, there would be immediate consequence, that your children, mother, daughters, they
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.000]   would be taken into captivity, and they may become slaves the rest of their lives.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.040]   So it wasn't just their livelihood or just their pride.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.360]   And so it was eager waiting to see if you won.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.080]   And so when they win, and they come back and they would celebrate, they would come back
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.900]   and say, "I have good news," right?
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.900]   Good news.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.020]   So culturally, the meaning of good news isn't just something good versus bad.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.240]   This is fantastic news.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   It's kind of like the news that would break out into a parade, right?
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.640]   And just like if you've seen video clips, maybe on YouTube, after World War II, you
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.560]   know, the U.S. conquers their enemies, and they would come back and have a huge parade.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.000]   And that's the kind of idea that this word euangelion has.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.760]   So the very word itself has the idea of celebration, right?
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   Fantastic news.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.720]   Jesus himself, in John 10:10, in the description of why he came, he says, "The thief comes
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.760]   only to steal and to kill and to destroy.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.160]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.600]   And you know the difference in the Greek between the word bios and zoe.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.680]   Bios is biology, where we get the word biology means the length of life, right?
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.760]   He didn't come so that we could live forever, because we all live forever.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.400]   Whether you're a Christian or a non-Christian, we have souls, we have spirits that will live
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   forever.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.000]   It's just the difference between will it be in heaven or will it be in hell.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.060]   That's a distinction.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.160]   So he's not saying that he came so that you can exist forever.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:03.240]   The word here used is zoe, where we get the word to be alive, where you can be living
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.920]   and not be alive, right?
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.200]   And that's exactly what happened at the fall.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.800]   Soon as they disobeyed God, zoe is what they lost.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.180]   Bios kept on going.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.160]   So he describes his very ministry, and that's why he says he came to give zoe and to have
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   it abundantly.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.340]   In other words, to celebrate, to restore the joy that was extinguished because of sin.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:36.240]   In fact, in Matthew 22, 1 through 14, Jesus compares the kingdom of God to a wedding feast,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   right?
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   To the wedding feast.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.840]   Verse 1 through 14, where he went out and invited people to come to his son's wedding,
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.280]   and people would say no, and then that's the whole parable that he gives, that the kingdom
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.160]   of God is like a wedding feast.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:59.580]   So Zion in this text is a description, not simply of a gathering, but of a wedding celebration
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:07.880]   that people are being gathered for the purpose of experiencing this joy, this zoe that was
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.000]   lost because of the fall.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.240]   So when we think about the wedding, right?
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.400]   And I know that there are some of you who've just experienced it, and some of you who are
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.000]   in the middle of doing that, right?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.040]   What's the first thing that you're concerned about when you're preparing for a wedding?
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.400]   Venue, right?
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.040]   Where are you going to get married?
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.560]   Well the venue is taken care of, it's Zion, right?
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.760]   Venue is taken care of, so it's Zion.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.120]   So what's the second thing that you're concerned about?
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.360]   Guest list, right?
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.840]   Who's coming to this?
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.160]   And so we're talking about this celebration, this wedding feast that's described in Mount
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.520]   Zion.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.600]   And so we know what the venue is, it's at Zion, right?
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.040]   It's a spiritual Jerusalem.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.800]   But the guest list is what he describes here, who's going to be at the celebration.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.840]   And so the first guests that are there, people who are there in celebration, it says there
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.960]   are myriads of angels, right?
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.160]   Why are the angels the first ones on this list?
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.680]   Remember when we were studying Hebrews chapter 1, many, many years ago?
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:17.680]   Okay, so those of you who are here, he begins, Hebrews chapter 1, description of all the
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.000]   things and all the people that Jesus Christ is superior over.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.720]   So he just goes down the list.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.340]   He's superior than Moses, more than the covenant, the high priest, the sacrifice itself.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.560]   But what does he begin with?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   Do you remember?
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.280]   Hebrews chapter 1?
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.700]   Okay, angels, right?
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.480]   Those of you who remember.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.280]   He starts the list of all the things that Jesus is superior over, and he starts at the
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.760]   very top.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.280]   Angels.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:50.320]   So I'm not going to revisit this sermon in why this was significant, but the angels were
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.240]   so venerated in the Jewish mind, it says in Colossians 2.18, that some of them were actually
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.200]   guilty of worshiping them.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.840]   So it naturally had a sense of, they had a sense of awe and respect for the angels, and
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.960]   rightfully so, because the angels were very powerful beings.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.760]   In fact, at Mount Sinai, when the law was given, the angels were present, the Bible
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.960]   says.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.200]   The angels were so powerful, in Genesis chapter 19, verse 13, when God brings judgment upon
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:29.360]   the nation of, upon Sodom and Gomorrah, only two angels were needed to wipe them out.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.800]   In 2 Kings 19.35, this, you know, whenever we talk about the Assyrians, they were the
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.980]   scary people who went and conquered and were so brutal.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:44.640]   When God brought judgment upon the Assyrians, it only required one angel to wipe out 185,000
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.880]   soldiers.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.640]   One angel.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.560]   So naturally, they were very powerful beings.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:59.680]   And so whenever humans encountered angels, their natural, natural inclination was to
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.300]   bow down and worship.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.200]   So there are many instances in the Bible where the angels have to stop them, and say, "Do
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.560]   not worship me, because I don't want to be judged."
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   Right?
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.160]   That's exactly what Satan wanted.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.640]   Satan wanted to be worshipped.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.480]   And so whenever people would bow down because they see something so much greater than them,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.320]   they would have to stop and say, "I'm just an angel.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.360]   I'm a creative being just like you."
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   Why is this significant?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:29.960]   It's significant because this, this wedding ceremony is a king's ceremony.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.100]   If somebody invited you to a wedding ceremony and you found out that all the superstars
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.200]   of this generation is going to be there, you're naturally going to want to be there.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   Right?
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.840]   You're naturally going to be all your favorite sports, all your favorite movie stars, all
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.200]   your favorite scientists, whatever it is that, that you look up to.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   Right?
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   So they're all going to be there.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:57.520]   And so for that reason, he's saying the angels, it's not just, it's not just one or two, myriads.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.720]   This literally is translated thousands.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.480]   Now thousands, that doesn't seem like a lot.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.440]   And if you, those of you who are a little bit older, when we were younger, when we described
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.260]   somebody rich, right?
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   What did we say?
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.960]   He's a millionaire.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.480]   Today if you own a home in Orange County, you might be a millionaire.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.000]   For sure if you own a home in San Jose, you're a millionaire.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Right?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.040]   But if we want to describe somebody very rich, we say multimillionaire or a billionaire.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.240]   Because millionaire doesn't just, just doesn't have the same ring.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.480]   And obviously because the, you know, the way we use the term now just has lost its significance.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.000]   So at this particular time, in order to describe something great in number, they would say
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.440]   thousands or thousands upon thousands.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.520]   And so what, what he is saying here is that there's countless number of angels who will
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   be present here.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.680]   In other words, right off the bat is to convey the significance of this event.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.000]   When you get to Zion, there's going to be myriads of angels that are going to be there
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.400]   in celebration.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:12.160]   Revelations 5, 11, 14 is a specific description of what he says here in Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.220]   He says, "Then I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.120]   creatures and the elders and the number of them was myriads upon myriads and thousands
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.200]   upon thousands saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.920]   and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.080]   Every created thing which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.800]   and all things in them I heard saying, 'To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.520]   be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.'
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:49.080]   And the four living creatures kept saying, 'Amen,' and the elders fell down and worshipped."
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.640]   That's the same scene that's being described here in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 where
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.680]   there's going to be this festival, this joyful gathering, this wedding feast where myriads
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.720]   of angels are going to be gathered together.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.840]   Would you notice how in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 that this gathering is going to be
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:17.960]   a joyful festival gathering but the same scene is described here as worship?
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.040]   You notice that?
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.400]   That joy and worship is used interchangeably.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.640]   Now if you don't have that idea of worship, it's just like worship, like what time is
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   worship?
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.280]   Especially if you grew up in the church and worship has become a habit, you don't think
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.920]   of worship as joy, you think of it as time.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.200]   What time is worship?
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.940]   When is this worship over?
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:51.240]   This idea of worship is something that we do to attend.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.000]   But the biblical concept of worship is joy.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.240]   What time do we come to celebrate?
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.680]   That's the idea of worship.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:06.880]   So therefore a Christian who is constantly grumbling cannot be in worship because worship
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.640]   by definition is to celebrate.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.360]   You can't be celebrating if you're constantly grumbling about something.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.960]   So if you notice here, worship and joy are described interchangeably.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:27.820]   We worship what causes the greatest joy in our life, do we not?
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.820]   Because the word worship comes from the Latin word, we are skipping, and it means to give
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.500]   worth to something.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.940]   That's the very definition of the English word worship.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.160]   We see value in it, so therefore we give praise.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.640]   So we naturally end up worshiping what brings the greatest joy.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.700]   If God is not the producer of the greatest joy in your life, you're going to see God
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.220]   as an obligation and then something else.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.020]   Take this worship over with.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:09.780]   You know, a lot of people get very frustrated if my sermon goes over, and not at this church.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:16.860]   If it goes over at certain times, like I've allowed you 40 minutes, 45 minutes, and I'll
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.060]   be gracious 50 minutes.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.420]   If you're insensitive, there's nothing you're going to say that's important enough to listen
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.100]   to over 50 minutes.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.340]   So I get kind of scowls, and I can see it on your faces sometimes.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.780]   Most of you are good.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.780]   Some of you are not.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:42.420]   As soon as I go over that allotted grace that you've given me, and it's like I've ruined
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.900]   your life because you have plans.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.260]   You got to go eat with your friends, and you're supposed to do something.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.220]   But what produces the greatest joy is not necessarily worship.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.260]   It's just this is something that has to be done, and then so that we can get to what
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.460]   produces joy.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:05.740]   But true worship is directly linked to what brings the greatest joy.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:13.480]   And if worship is what causes the greatest joy, whatever causes the greatest joy is constantly
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.820]   on our mind.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.560]   Those of you who are sports fans, right?
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.700]   If you're a Dodgers fan, is Dodgers playing today?
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.740]   I have no idea because I'm not a big Dodgers fan.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.820]   But if you're a Dodgers fan, you probably know.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.140]   And you probably know the stats of the people who are playing.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.060]   You probably know how they played the last game.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.940]   You probably know their standing.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.140]   You probably know what they have to do in order for them to advance.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.620]   And you get frustrated and happy based upon how your team does because it produces a great
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.060]   amount of joy.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:52.660]   Whatever that causes the greatest amount of joy is on our mind constantly.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.660]   You don't have to be reminded.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:59.020]   In fact, you get frustrated when other fans don't know.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.020]   You call yourself a Dodgers fan and you don't know.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.340]   You're not angry that they lost.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.540]   What's wrong with you?
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.740]   Whatever causes the greatest joy is on your mind constantly.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.620]   And if it causes the greatest joy in your life, you end up sharing it.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.540]   This has nothing to do with being an extrovert and an introvert.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.780]   Oh, I'm not good at witnessing because I'm an introvert.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:26.100]   I've never seen an introvert who keeps their greatest passions to themselves.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:31.180]   You may not be screaming it, but your wife, your children know exactly what you like and
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.180]   don't like.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.180]   You don't have to say it.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.180]   They know it.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.800]   So if that's your greatest joy, you end up sharing it.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.460]   You go out and you love this movie.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.740]   You probably told your friends about it.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.640]   They know about it.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.900]   So whatever produces the greatest joy, it ends up leaking.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:53.080]   You end up telling other people about it because they say, "Oh, that makes that guy so happy."
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.400]   And so you end up becoming a witness.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:03.960]   And whatever is creating the greatest joy in your life, automatically you feel a community
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.440]   with other people that loves the same thing.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.520]   So if you're a Dodgers fan, my guess is you're in some sort of a chat room with other Dodgers
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.420]   fans, and when you're sad, you're sad together.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.240]   When you're happy, you're happy together, right?
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.760]   And you celebrate.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.720]   And the people in that room, you may not even know, right?
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.440]   The other parts of their life, all you know is that the same thing causes joy in your
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.880]   life.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.540]   And so community happens.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:41.040]   So if you're a church and you have a church filled with people whose not the greatest
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:48.000]   joy is not Christ, you have to produce a community with artificial things.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.600]   We have a rock climbing church, rock climbing fellowship at the church.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.360]   So anybody who's rock climbing, let's get together.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.760]   Anybody who's older than 50, we're going to have a community there.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.160]   Anybody who likes water or whatever, right?
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.720]   I don't have a lot of hobbies, that's all.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:14.280]   Like fishing or, so you have to create this artificial love that's not Christ to get together
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.120]   because that's the connection.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:23.640]   But if you have true, true joy from, let's say, playing Dodgers, do you have an age limit
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   there?
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   Right?
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.360]   Is that, oh, we're going to have a chat room for Dodgers fans, but you have to be 30 and
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   over.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360]   Right?
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.360]   You have to have this kind of income.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.920]   You have to have this kind of hobbies.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   No.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.720]   The only criteria is you love Dodgers.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.000]   And whoever loves Dodgers, whether you are a 13 year old or a 70 year old, the fact that
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.440]   you are sharing this joy together produces this community.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.920]   And so the church is a gathering of place that have people who have seen the glory of
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:56.600]   the gospel of Jesus Christ and loving Christ, proclaiming Christ produces the greatest joy
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.480]   and the community happens.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.400]   That's what happened in the early church with the Jews, the Gentiles, the tax collectors,
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.000]   the fishermen, the educated, uneducated slave owners and former slaves.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.400]   They all gathered together because the same thing produces joy in them.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:22.380]   Whatever causes the greatest joy is the source of the greatest community.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.360]   That's why our primary goal is to proclaim Christ.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.940]   Because if you love Christ, this gathering is not a, so that we can produce a false sense
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.160]   of unity because we have things in common.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.280]   We went to the same school, we're the same age, we speak the same language, same culture,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   we eat the same food.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.000]   It's so superficial.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.560]   But what's unique about the church is that no matter what background, no matter where
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:50.320]   you came from, no matter how different we were before we came in together, what causes
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.160]   the greatest joy in our lives is the same.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.240]   And that's what produces a true community.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:05.400]   Fifthly, whatever produces the greatest joy in our life, we are more than willing to pay
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.000]   the most price for.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.480]   Again, if you're a Dodgers fan and they're at the World Series and even though you're
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.080]   struggling financially, you will sell your car if you have to.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:21.480]   If you're a true fan, to get the best seats.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.720]   Because it produces the greatest joy in your life.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:30.680]   You're willing to pay whatever the cost is and not because you are more disciplined than
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:36.560]   other people, because you're more noble, it's because it produces the greatest joy.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:42.240]   And because it produces the greatest joy, you're willing to pay the highest price.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.040]   So when Jesus says to pick up your cross, it's not just a cross, oh we got to bear,
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.840]   we got to suffer for Jesus Christ, but it produces the greatest joy.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.920]   And that's how it's described in Matthew chapter 13 to 46, he says, "The kingdom of heaven
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.240]   is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid again, and from joy over
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.800]   it goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.640]   And then again he says in verse 45, "Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:17.160]   fine pearls, and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.040]   had and bought it."
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.600]   There are two things I want to emphasize here.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.920]   One, the reason why they were willing to pay the ultimate price, sell everything for that,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.920]   is because they saw the value.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.680]   They saw the value of what they found.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.280]   And if a Christian either forgets or distracted and are more tempted by the things of this
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.520]   world and we forget what it is that we have in Christ, worship is faked.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:50.640]   Because worship happens as a result of seeing the value of what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.280]   And you notice because he knew the value, what was his motivation?
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.680]   Joy.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.640]   So his sacrifice wasn't sacrifice, he was trading something that is of lesser value
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.240]   or something of greater value.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:14.200]   So he was investing for the future, but the primary motivation was joy.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.640]   And what produced joy is because they recognized the value.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.680]   That's the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   That's why the Bible says that the God of this age has blinded the mind of the unbelievers
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.220]   so they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.220]   So they don't see the value in Christ.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.320]   They don't see the value of this good news.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   It's just news.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.680]   It's just one of many information.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:42.760]   But a Christian is one whose eyes have been opened and have seen the ultimate value of
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.560]   God.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.640]   And as a result of that, they are willing to sell everything that they have.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:54.400]   They are willing to give their life in order to have what is given to us.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.000]   So in John chapter 15 verse 11, if you know that passage, John chapter 11 is the passage
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.960]   where Jesus gives the I am divine and you are the branches and you cannot bear fruit
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.640]   unless you abide in me.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.520]   If you abide in me, my word is abiding in you.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.540]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be given to you.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.880]   And it is in that text he says in verse 11, these things I have spoken to you so that
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:22.920]   what my joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.700]   The joy that he has so that you can have it.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:33.700]   And so if we don't understand the value of what it is that we have in Christ, his imperative.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.560]   So oftentimes people say, oh man, when we talk about the grace of God, the love of God,
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.920]   it is unconditional and it causes joy because we have this unconditional love of God.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.240]   And then when we talk about imperatives, about picking up the cross and sacrificing, suffering
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.040]   for the name of Jesus Christ, man, that's heavy.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.160]   Man, what a downer.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:00.440]   But he says here the reason why he gives the indicatives and the reason why he gives imperatives
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.400]   is for the same reason.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.720]   So that we may have joy.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:11.440]   He tells us to pick up our cross because he's trying to produce in us the joy that he has.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.640]   It's for that joy.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.680]   That's why in Hebrews chapter 11, 15 to 16, all these people who have sacrificed everything
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.080]   because of the promise that God gave.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.920]   Indeed, if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.840]   have had opportunity to return.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.760]   But as it is, they desire a better country.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.160]   That is a heavenly one.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.520]   Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared a city for them.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.600]   See, the reason, if our joy comes from something that this world produces, then naturally you're
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.880]   going to pursue this world, right?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.920]   And you can't help it.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.740]   Because if you see that whatever it is that you want, you find fulfillment is in this
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:00.020]   world, then God kind of is a hindrance to that.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.200]   God becomes a hindrance.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.480]   Even though you proclaim to be a Christian, if what you value is something that you can
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.360]   attain in this world, then you're going to do everything in your power to pursue what's
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.400]   in this world.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.600]   And God is going to be a hindrance to that.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.720]   So you want just enough God so that you can have insurance for eternity, but God is not
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.120]   your pursuit.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.680]   God is just somebody to help you pursue this, and you realize after time goes by that that's
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.440]   not what God wants for you.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.640]   So you end up choosing.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.600]   If God's not going to give me this, I don't want him.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.960]   And so that's part of the reason why so many people drift and so many people choose to
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   walk away from God.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.920]   It's not because at one point in their life God disappointed them.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.640]   From the get-go, God is not what they wanted.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.080]   They wanted something from God, but it is not God that they wanted.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:56.920]   See, worship to many people is nothing more than putting their time in.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:02.680]   Worship at Bering Community Church happens at 9 o'clock, and then it happens at 11 o'clock,
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.160]   and I've permitted hour and a half.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.920]   Don't go over hour and a half, because after an hour and a half, you're ruining my life.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   I have schedules.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   I have lunch appointments.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.100]   I've got things I've got to do.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:20.500]   But the biblical definition of worship is where we come to receive life in the presence
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.560]   of the only one who can give life.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.840]   And so in John chapter 4, 21 to 23, I'm not going to read the whole passage where he has
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.600]   this encounter with the Samaritan woman.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.480]   She recognizes that he is no ordinary person, and he said, "You Jews want to worship in
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   this mountain.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   We worship in that mountain.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.440]   We have different opinions of where we should worship."
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:44.720]   And it is to that response he says, "What God is looking for is true worshipers."
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.240]   Whether you worship in this mountain or that mountain, whether it's 9 o'clock or 11 o'clock,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.000]   that's not the point.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.360]   What God is looking for are people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   True worship.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.440]   People who are coming to God because they recognize the value of what it is that we
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.280]   have in Christ.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.520]   And that's why the Bible is filled with the word, "Remember."
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.200]   Remember.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.280]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.620]   Remember when you first heard the gospel.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.220]   Remember the beginning of your faith where that meant everything to you.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:26.980]   If you've drifted from that, spiritual maturity is not knowing more.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:33.700]   It's not finding out the deep mysteries that you can only find by reading so many books.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.140]   Spiritual maturity is remembering what you had from day one.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.420]   Everything that you needed for life and godliness has been given to you in the knowledge of
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.660]   His Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.740]   And that's why He says, "Remember," repeatedly, over and over.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:54.860]   Because God is looking for people who are worshiping Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:00.220]   And that should be the goal and is the goal of every single church.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.780]   We don't call a church a successful church because we have more people than the church
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.560]   down the street.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.260]   We're better programmed or better preaching or better whatever it is that we think the
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   church is.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:16.380]   A good church and a bad church, the distinction is worship.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.380]   Are people worshiping in spirit and in truth?
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.780]   Or are they just checking in and checking out?
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.580]   Because that's what God is looking for.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.940]   Man may look for the human product.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.140]   What God is looking for is true worship.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.380]   And that's why He says, "Myriads and myriads, but secondly, this is the gathering of the
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:41.300]   church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven."
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.620]   When we say church, there's always two parts.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.180]   There's a universal church and the local church.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:52.540]   The universal church is God's program, God's membership, and only God knows.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.660]   True people who genuinely know God.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.860]   You and I do not have the power to discern.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.060]   The Bible says there's wheat in the tares.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:07.220]   So as long as we're here physically, there will always be some wheat and tares in the
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.220]   church.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.180]   He's going to discern at the end who they are.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:18.140]   So even at the best of our celebration, it's always going to have some mix in the church.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:24.820]   Some people who genuinely love Christ and want to meet Christ, and that's all they want.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.820]   And then there's going to be people in the church who say, "I don't fit in."
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.820]   Because their primary goal is not God.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.300]   There's all the things that's going to be mixed in.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.620]   But the celebration that you and I are going to experience when we get to Zion is going
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.580]   to be pure celebration.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:47.460]   There's no Poser Dodger fans.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.100]   They're only there when they win.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.860]   "Oh, I want some of that."
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.460]   And they come, but then they don't suffer with you.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.140]   They don't invest with you.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.660]   So the church has both.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:05.500]   And so we want to preach in a way that those who don't have genuine faith wake up, and
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.420]   hopefully that the true gospel causes them to come to Christ.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:16.180]   So our celebration at best is always going to have some mixture in the church.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.100]   But in Zion, he says it's going to be perfect.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.860]   Only true fans of Christ are going to be there.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.060]   So when we celebrate, we're going to be around other people who are going to be celebrating
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.300]   with us.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.860]   I think if you're a sports fan, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:40.260]   If your team wins and you just happen to be with other people who is a true fan, not a
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:48.140]   bandwagoner, but a true fan, you know the joy, the celebration, the koinonia that you
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.500]   feel.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.060]   You know nothing about that person.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:57.980]   They may be from rival gangs sitting next to each other, and they're hugging each other,
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:03.220]   celebrating, high-fiving, because it's pure worship.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:08.900]   In heaven, we're going to experience that pure joy, because he's going to separate the
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.300]   wheat and the tares, and only true worshipers of God are going to gather together worshiping.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.740]   No one's going to be bored there.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.160]   No one's falling asleep there.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.900]   No one is tired over there.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.340]   It's going to be pure worship.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.380]   In Revelation 7, 9-10, it says, "After these things, I looked, and behold, great multitude
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:33.140]   which no one could count, from every nation, and all the tribes, and the peoples, and tongues,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.260]   standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.340]   were in their hands.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:43.180]   And they cry out with a loud voice, saying, 'Salvation to our God, who sits on the throne,
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.420]   and to the Lamb!'"
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:55.180]   If you are not a true worshiper of God, that sounds boring.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.340]   Worship is not going to end at 12-15.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.580]   It's like, "I gave you 45 minutes.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.100]   This is eternity."
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.820]   If you are not a true worshiper of God, this is not something to look forward to.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.220]   Are you kidding?
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.820]   That's why non-Christians always say, "Ah, heaven's boring.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.620]   I want to go to hell so that I can party with people like me."
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:23.820]   Hell is not described as a party.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.440]   In Hebrews 12-2, that's why it says, "Fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:34.060]   of our faith, for the joy set before Him endured the cross."
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.420]   He didn't go to the cross because He was attracted to the cross.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:44.060]   He said He put up with the cross in order to have joy.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.980]   Now what is this joy He's referring to?
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.300]   It's something about me and you.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.700]   Because that's why He didn't have it this side of the cross.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:59.020]   He was willing to endure the cross so that He can have joy in us, and that we can have
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.980]   joy in Him.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.940]   That's the purpose of the cross.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.300]   It's not like, "Hey, here's a bunch of things that you should do.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.180]   Here's the Ten Commandments, and if you're a good person, you do these ten things.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:17.660]   You wake up early in the morning, and you're just gritted and more disciplined than other
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.660]   people.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.020]   You're going to work harder than everybody else, and next thing you know, your joy is
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.020]   killed."
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:29.060]   Again, there's nothing wrong with these things if that's our pursuit of joy, if that causes
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.140]   us to worship God more.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:38.940]   But if what we're doing as Christians is causing us to be bitter and angry and upset,
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.900]   it's the exact opposite of what God is trying to produce in us.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.900]   True worship.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:52.620]   The best witness as a church is to become the best worshippers.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:57.400]   Because the non-Christians, when they come see us, and if what produces joy in us is
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.580]   no different than the world, there's no reason to come here.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.540]   If we're happy when we make money, and we're sad when we don't make money, if we make good
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:14.180]   investments and we get sick and not get sick, and if the world sees that our joy is no different
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.180]   than what produces joy in them, there's no difference in us than them.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:24.900]   What's unique about our fellowship is what produces joy that the world does not understand.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.140]   Why are you so happy in the middle of a pandemic?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.340]   Why are you so happy when your job is the way it is?
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.940]   Why are you so happy when you're so tired raising kids?
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.300]   What's different about you?
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.380]   What is producing that life and joy in you?
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:46.300]   And that causes us to say it's because of God, who does not fade, who does not perish,
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.260]   does not spoil.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:54.100]   Our salvation, our promise, our inheritance is preserved for us by the power of God until
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.420]   he comes.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.700]   So our joy and our worship is not like the world.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.020]   And that's the best witness.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.220]   A person who is not worshiping God in spirit and in truth, and you try to share the gospel
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.220]   with somebody, all you're doing is regurgitating information.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.260]   You're not being a witness.
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:17.100]   A witness is somebody who's seen life.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.940]   They've seen life, they've seen joy.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.700]   This is where I get the joy, this is where I feel I find life, and you want to share
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.340]   that with other people.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.300]   That's true worship, that's what he's seeking for.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.700]   Let me get to the third thing, and then the final part we're going to save for next week,
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.700]   because I don't want to go over 50 minutes.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.060]   I want you to be happy when we leave.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.360]   He says, millions of angels are going to be there.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.580]   This is the gathering of the true church, who's going to be worshiping together, and
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:53.180]   then God, the judge of all.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:57.580]   Why would you, there's all kinds of things that you could describe God as.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.940]   God of love is going to be there.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.460]   God of eternal grace is going to be there.
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.780]   God, the provider, is going to be there.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.940]   No, God, the judge of all, is also going to be there.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.980]   Why does he ruin this with this description?
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.500]   There's all kinds of things going to be described.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:23.820]   But when the word judge, if I ask you to describe the word judge, what does the word judge mean?
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.900]   To discern right and wrong.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.060]   But why do we, when we hear the word judge, it's automatically negative.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:37.140]   We say, judge, don't judge me.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.860]   Don't be judgmental.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.820]   God the judge, and all of a sudden, what do we see?
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.820]   Mount Sinai.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.460]   I thought we were in Zion.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.740]   Why is God described as the God of Mount Sinai?
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:56.660]   The word judge, in and of itself, is a neutral word to discern right and wrong.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.940]   And it's not negative.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:05.980]   The reason why it produces a negative emotion is because there's something guilty in us.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:12.180]   A guilty person standing before a holy God, and you hear the word judge, immediately judgment
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.020]   is condemnation.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:22.180]   But those who have been covered by the blood of Christ, God the judge is our protector.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.700]   God the judge is our leader.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.660]   God the judge is our provider.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.660]   And that's what you and I need to remember when we get to heaven, is that God the judge,
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.700]   and it's just like the way, remember the book of Judges?
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.220]   The book of Judges, the theme is, everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:45.420]   And you notice there, it doesn't say everyone did what was wrong in their own eyes, it said
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.820]   everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:54.140]   Some of the greatest sins that are committed in human history are committed by people who
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:59.880]   are convinced that they are right, based on their own moral compass.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.060]   That's what's going on right now in our generation.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.940]   Everyone is proclaiming what they're doing is righteous.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.980]   And they're willing to do whatever it takes to get their point across.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.860]   And he says, the reason why Israel kept on falling is because everyone did what was right
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.700]   in their own eyes.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.420]   And then as a result of that, the judgment would come, and they would cry out to God,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.100]   and who would he raise?
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.140]   A judge.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.540]   That's why that book is called the Judges.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:30.860]   So the judge in nation's history was a deliverer.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.360]   Judge is the one who protected them.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.920]   Judge is the one that brought revival.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.960]   Judge is the one who brought righteousness in the nation of Israel.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:43.460]   So here when he says, God the judge will be there, for those who are unrepentant, is not
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:49.840]   covered by the blood of Christ, yes, the God the judge will bring condemnation.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.740]   We will have to give account of every sin, every careless word the Bible says.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.960]   And we will have to pay for that.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.100]   Just like if you were to stand before a human judge.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:05.200]   But the judge that he's referring to here, Mount Zion, are those who stand before a holy
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.500]   God and have been declared righteous because of the blood of Christ.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.900]   He will protect us, he will provide for us, he will guide us, he will lead us, and righteousness
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:19.200]   will prevail because of the blood of Christ for eternity.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.220]   That's what he has called us to.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.140]   So this is a cause of celebration.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.660]   We're not here to put in our time.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.420]   We're not here to say, you know, I attended worship.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.780]   You know, at least I went.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:36.820]   No, we came to celebrate.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.820]   That's what this is.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.860]   Worship is a time of celebrating, celebrating what God has done for us.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.260]   So again, I want to encourage you and I want to ask you this question.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:52.240]   And as we take some time to pray, as we ask our worship team to come back up.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:57.780]   When was the last time you really came to God seeking life?
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.520]   Now, I understand, like justification.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.580]   I came to God years ago, 10 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, and I wanted life.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.500]   I wanted my sins to be justified by the blood of Christ.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:19.420]   But when was the last time you came to Christ to experience this life, to have greater joy,
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:24.220]   to feel alive because of Christ?
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:31.380]   And if we've seen something in the world that produces joy and then church just as a maintenance
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:36.520]   so that we can have insurance to go to heaven, you're completely missing the whole point
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.820]   of our existence, the purpose of our salvation, so that we may have this joy and have it to
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.900]   the fullest.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:51.920]   So my prayer and my encouragement is to see our gathering as the greatest place of joy.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.280]   Remember what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.160]   Remember the gift that we have.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:03.960]   And stop complaining that we're on this plane together to Zion and grumbling that you didn't
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.400]   get the first class seat.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.120]   You know, I wanted to sit on the aisle.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:12.360]   How come they get to sit on the aisle?
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.160]   And you're on the coach seat and you're coveting the people who are in the business class.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.600]   Why do they get business class?
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.500]   Because we've forgotten where we're going.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.720]   When we land, we're going to be in Zion.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:32.560]   Maybe God put you on the coach because there's people in the coach that you'll be celebrating
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   with.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   Maybe you're going to get greater reward because you're in the coach.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.080]   I don't know why we're in the coach.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:44.600]   But to be grumbling because we're in the coach because we're closer to the toilet?
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   Think about where we're going.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.960]   Think about what's at the other side when we land.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:56.320]   Think about what's coming when Christ comes so that we would learn to celebrate and have
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.760]   life here and have it abundantly.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   Let's pray.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:09.000]   Again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray and reflect and let
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.600]   the Word of God bear fruit in our hearts.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.280]   Make an honest confession before God.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.700]   God, I made you a task in my life.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:24.160]   Everything that needs to be done, and I've made the world my treasure.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.680]   Lord, help me.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.760]   I believe.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.440]   Help my unbelief.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.920]   I'm not able.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.480]   I need you.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.720]   Take some time to honestly confess before God.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   Help me.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.720]   Open my eyes that I may see once again the treasure that I have in you so that I may
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.440]   worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.560]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
