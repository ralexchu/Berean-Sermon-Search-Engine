[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:58.120]   - Good morning.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.360]   I wanna first start off by telling you
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.120]   that we were scheduled to have communion this morning,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.240]   but we're gonna have to, at least for this service,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   we're gonna postpone that to next Sunday.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.360]   Because of the growing size of our church,
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.020]   we miscalculated a number of the things that we have.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.100]   So instead of having some of you participate
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.980]   and some of you not participating,
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.060]   that we wanna keep the unity of what communion represents.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.980]   And so, yeah, so we apologize.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.020]   So we're gonna participate at least for this service.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.380]   First service, we're okay with.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.860]   Second service, we're gonna do that next week, okay?
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.060]   We have a Christmas service that's coming up
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.300]   in a couple weeks, not this Sunday, but Sunday after that.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.760]   And so for that, every Christmas,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.960]   we try to be deliberate about inviting non-Christian friends
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.120]   or you may have friends that maybe kinda claim
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.680]   to be Christian, but they only go to church
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.560]   maybe once a year, twice a year.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.520]   And so people are usually more open to coming to church
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.000]   during Christmas than any other time of the year.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.840]   And so we wanna take advantage of that
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.400]   and we wanna redeem the time that we have.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.320]   And so our outreach team and our media team
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.640]   has created these cards of invitation
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.120]   for the Christmas service.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.060]   So they can come and hear the clear presentation
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.660]   of the gospel, what does Christmas mean?
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.380]   And so that by celebrating Christmas,
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.680]   that we'll be able to invite non-Christians
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.760]   and be able to hear the gospel.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.540]   So if you didn't get this, make sure that as you're going
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.940]   out to grab a few of 'em, grab as much as you need.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.180]   And it's a good way to open conversations
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.160]   with non-Christians just by asking them what Christmas is.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.500]   And even if they don't come, it's an opportunity
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.940]   to share with them what the meaning of Christmas is.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.820]   And by doing so, maybe you can break the ice
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.740]   of some people, your coworkers,
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.860]   people that you've been praying for.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.340]   So we want to, they've made this,
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.780]   so grab as many as you need.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.720]   And if we run out, we can always print some more.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.140]   But again, be mindful of this for both services, 9 and 11.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.380]   And also, after that, an announcement was made last week,
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.100]   but there is going to be a table that's gonna be set up
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.660]   on the 19th for people who are seeking
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.520]   and they have questions.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.100]   And Pastor Mark is gonna give a brief presentation
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.300]   of the gospel there.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.140]   And our outreach team will be at the table
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.120]   answering any kind of questions that they may have.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.300]   So they're gonna really approaching this
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.340]   as an opportunity to share the gospel with people.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.420]   So if you are bringing people, again,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.460]   all of these things will be available to you.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.020]   So please take this with you.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.800]   And at minimum, to be prayerful,
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.900]   that we would redeem the time that we have
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.500]   in this opportunity, okay?
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.400]   As you guys know, today is BBA finals.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.320]   And some of you guys who are participating,
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.040]   the reason I mentioned that is because some of you
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.440]   could care less and some of you are more ping pong players
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.740]   than anything else.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.220]   And there is a ping pong tournament that is coming up.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.380]   So those of you who missed out on the BBA,
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.260]   there is a ping pong doubles tournament that's happening.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.380]   And we usually do this,
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.580]   so you know who the ping pong players are, okay?
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:56.580]   So at the New Year's Eve, at 6 p.m. here in the sanctuary,
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.440]   I think it's gonna be here, or most likely in the cafe,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.260]   we will have a doubles ping pong tournament.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.300]   The cost of it is $5.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.700]   And so you can just sign up
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.020]   and they'll give you directions on that.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.940]   So 6 p.m. to I think 9 p.m.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.840]   And then at 11 p.m. we have New Year's Eve service
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.100]   that evening, okay?
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.140]   So this is happening on September 31st.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.220]   So all skill levels are welcome,
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.740]   even if you can't beat the Kangs.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.360]   You guys are more than welcome to come and participate
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.380]   and just to fellowship and hang out with people.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.340]   So it's a good opportunity to meet other people as well.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.660]   So please sign up for that as soon as you can.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.300]   And then right after I pray for our offering,
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.580]   again, if you are new to the church,
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.580]   our offering basket, physical basket is in the back.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.020]   So you can go there after service
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.540]   and you can drop off the physical offering there.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.380]   Otherwise you can prepare for the electronic offering.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.140]   And after our main pray set,
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.100]   our sister Mary Kim is going to come and give her testimony
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.280]   and be baptized this morning, okay?
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.060]   So let me pray for us and I'll give you a minute
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.900]   to prepare your offering.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.740]   Let's pray.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.380]   (pastor praying)
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.460]   - Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.500]   for the blessing that you've given us.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.020]   And even in the midst of our busy schedule,
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.440]   help us Lord God to be anchored in Christ,
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.220]   our thought, our mind, our heart,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.500]   that it may fully belong to you.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.740]   That the end of this busy season,
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.620]   that we would not come out of it just tired and fatigued,
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.000]   but that our spirit would be renewed
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.780]   and strengthened Lord God,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.580]   that we may give all our attention, all our hope,
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.500]   all our worship Lord that you deserve.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.340]   I pray that as we give our offering,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.220]   may it be multiplied for your use and for your kingdom.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.040]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.

[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.740]   (bell chimes)
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:19.120]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.880]   My name is Mary Kim and I'm a third year student at UCI
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.400]   and this is my testimony.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.560]   I was born into a Christian family
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.320]   and grew up going to church.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.280]   From an early age,
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.040]   I witnessed my mom's unwavering faith in God
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.560]   as she raised our family
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.520]   and later witnessed my two older brothers
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.220]   accept Christ in their early teenage years.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.800]   With a lack of personal faith and conviction,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.480]   I grew up believing that I was Christian
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.000]   because I never disagreed with what I was taught
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.200]   and I desired to be seen as an obedient,
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.820]   good child in the church.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.460]   I trusted that Christianity was true and right
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.840]   because I trusted in my family's judgment.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.340]   For most of my life, my faith came secondhand.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.580]   Having the right answers in Bible study
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.360]   and knowing how to talk about God were easy,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.340]   but loving others and applying what I learned
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.300]   out of a genuine love for God was frustratingly difficult.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.980]   I felt that God was a distant being
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.780]   that was always unsatisfied
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.380]   with how I failed to prioritize and love him enough.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.180]   I thought that everyone read the Bible
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.260]   and spent time in prayer out of dedication and diligence
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.700]   and not out of a true desire to do so.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.820]   Without knowing the gospel,
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.100]   I tried to produce good fruit on my own,
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.900]   striving to achieve righteousness
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.820]   through my own willpower and wisdom.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.260]   There came a point in early high school
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.380]   when I was faced with a mountain of burnout and doubt.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.000]   When I compared my faith with that of my mom and brothers,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.300]   there was a stark lack of genuinity and love.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.380]   My heart hardened over time with pride
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.140]   from my self-perceived maturity and holiness,
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.700]   along with the unsettling fear
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.460]   of facing the potential illegitimate status
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.940]   of my faith and God himself.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.380]   I learned to push thoughts of God
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:00.060]   and everything to do with him to the back of my mind
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.460]   in an act of self-preservation.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.460]   I didn't want to think about
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.860]   whether my family's faith was foolish
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.580]   or whether I wasn't one of God's elect.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.220]   I felt helpless because I thought I had tried my hardest
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.460]   to please God and do what was right,
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.080]   but in reality, I saw God as someone I had to please
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.900]   so that he would do what I wanted
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.640]   and didn't understand my own sinfulness and depravity.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.000]   Our family began tuning in
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.700]   to Berean Sunday service live streams in August 2020.
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.860]   Pastor Peter's expository messages
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.600]   and adherence to the word struck me deeply.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.160]   After growing up in a church that preached topically
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.200]   and often implicitly preached the gospel,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.700]   I was shaken by the clarity of truth and boldness
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.940]   with which he faithfully preached.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.160]   I felt for the first time
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.040]   that I could get somewhere in my faith
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.180]   by staying at Berean and absorbing the biblical truths
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.940]   that I didn't realize I was hungry for.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.500]   However, halfway into membership classes,
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.460]   I was asked to submit my testimony.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.500]   I talked with Pastor Nate,
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.440]   sharing my disheartening experience
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.180]   of striving to be a good Christian,
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.940]   but not even knowing who God is to me personally.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.420]   I wasn't sure what to make of my life of bitterness
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.020]   and lack of transformation,
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.540]   along with my newfound passion
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.100]   of learning more about God through his word at Berean.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.500]   At the end of our conversation,
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.380]   it was clear that I was not saved,
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.080]   as there was never a moment of true repentance in my life.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.820]   Over the next few months,
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.200]   I met regularly with a Berean sister in my class
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.580]   named Danielle Choi,
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:27.220]   and she walked me through the gospel.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.020]   God revealed to me how I never knew him and lived for him,
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.900]   as I reflected on what I lived for.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.520]   It wasn't a matter of not giving up
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.540]   enough of my life to God.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.380]   He showed me that all of my intentions
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.740]   were for my own glory, satisfaction, and kingdom.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.680]   He showed me how my heart rebelled against him
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.820]   as I idolized myself, my relationships, and material things.
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.860]   I reflected on the vanity and folly
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.040]   of chasing after things of the world,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.440]   of living for myself in worship of my broken self.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.660]   After sharing with Danielle
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.220]   that I was questioning the way
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.140]   I've been living my life for the first time,
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.620]   she asked me what I thought I needed saving from.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.700]   In love, she firmly reminded me
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.620]   that coming to salvation is not a matter
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.980]   of choosing between life as a better fulfilled person
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.480]   or life as a worse flawed person.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.940]   Someone's faith or lack of faith
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.100]   results in eternal consequences of life or death,
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.020]   set by an eternal and holy God.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.000]   God showed me how far I had fallen
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.880]   from him and his holiness,
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.680]   and in my helpless state, as I understood my personality,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.900]   as I understood my personal identity as a sinner.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.640]   He opened my eyes to my sin
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.880]   and absolute need for salvation.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.800]   I repented of my sin, knowing that Jesus
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.960]   is the only one who could and did take my sins,
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.000]   die for me, and grant me righteousness and freedom.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.840]   For the first time, God broke my heart over my sin,
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.660]   compelling me to turn away from inherent dirtiness
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.700]   and rebellion against him.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.840]   He was already offering me the completed work of salvation
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.140]   if I would place my faith in him.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.640]   John 5, 24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.680]   "he who hears my word and believes in him
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.600]   "who has sent me has eternal life
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.040]   "and does not come into judgment,
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.260]   "but has passed out of death into life."
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:17.160]   I placed my faith in Jesus in late August, 2021,
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.180]   trusting that it is only by God's grace
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.880]   through faith I can be saved.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.780]   I am living life ever in awe of the love and grace
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.420]   that God has shown me as I look at
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.140]   what Jesus has done on the cross.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.060]   Romans 5, 8 says, "But God demonstrates
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.980]   "his own love for us in this.
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.800]   "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.620]   "There was nothing I could offer God,
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.900]   "nothing I could do to redeem myself,
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.620]   "nothing good or valuable in me,
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:44.820]   "and yet he sent his son to die for me
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.400]   "so that he would adopt me into his kingdom."
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.380]   I am learning more about God's character and works
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.260]   as I read his word and pray.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.940]   I am growing in praise and thanksgiving
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.740]   as he reveals his truth
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.460]   and continuously proves his faithfulness to me.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.660]   God is humbling me as he enlightens
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.700]   my weaknesses and need for him.
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.620]   I want to live my life in full submission to God,
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.780]   being sanctified and molded into his likeness
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.500]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:15.300]   Galatians 2, 20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.060]   "and it is no longer I who live,
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.340]   "but Christ lives in me,
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.900]   "and the life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.800]   "I live by faith in the Son of God
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.420]   "who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:26.260]   Thank you.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:30.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.320]   (people chattering)
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   (people chattering)
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.320]  , (people chattering)
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   (people chattering)
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:52.820]   (people chattering)
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:56:05.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.400]   (people cheering)
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:18.800]   - All right, thank you, Mary, for that great testimony.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.480]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 13,
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:32.240]   and we're gonna be reading from verse 10 through 14.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.760]   And yes, we're gonna be covering all of it today.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.400]   Hebrews chapter 10, verse 13, verses 10 through 14.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:49.360]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.720]   We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.520]   have no right to eat,
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.420]   for the bodies of those animals whose blood
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.680]   is brought into the holy place by the high priest
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:02.600]   as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.720]   Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.760]   through his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.080]   So let us go out to him outside the camp,
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.840]   bearing his reproach, for here we do not have a lasting city
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.280]   but we are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.100]   Let's pray.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:23.120]   Heavenly Father, we pray for deeper understanding.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.640]   We pray for grace to cause us, Lord God,
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.280]   to think more deeply of who you are,
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.960]   that your word would have its effect
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.240]   in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.520]   We entrust this time to you, asking for your blessing
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.620]   upon it, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:45.240]   You know, one of the blessings of living
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.600]   in the United States as a Christian
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.880]   is whenever we travel, we've spent so many years
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.920]   out in China trying to share the gospel
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.320]   with Chinese students who grew up
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.440]   under the communist regime,
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.480]   and they were never taught about Christianity.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.240]   There's some kind of religion,
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.600]   and yet they practice Christmas.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.560]   So they have Christmas trees and gifts
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.200]   and stockings and Santa Claus,
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.080]   and so they have all the decorations,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.480]   but they've never really been taught
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.800]   what these holidays mean.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   So whenever we go, obviously it's illegal
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.440]   to outright share the gospel with them,
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.040]   especially to minors, but it's not very hard
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.720]   to share the gospel because all we have to do
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.040]   is share about American holidays.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.920]   And so we would teach about history
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.600]   and various things and about grammar,
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.280]   but we would always make sure that we have
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.320]   one class that American holidays,
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.240]   and obviously we would share about Easter,
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.160]   Thanksgiving, Christmas, and so whenever we teach that,
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.200]   the gospel's gonna come out, right?
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.040]   And they say, "Hey, you're not supposed
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:43.880]   "to share the gospel."
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.120]   It's like, "Oh, we're just telling them
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.720]   "what Christmas is about."
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.560]   It's like, "You're not supposed to talk
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.400]   "about the resurrection."
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.200]   It's like, "Oh, we're just talking about Easter."
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.840]   Right, and so that's how we're able
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.560]   to share the gospel in all these years
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.520]   coming in and out of China,
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.840]   because it's embedded into this culture.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.800]   The Judeo-Christian principles and things,
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.560]   even though we may be moving away from it today,
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.120]   it's embedded into the culture.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.120]   And that's one of the benefits of being in a culture
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.360]   where even around us today, we have so many people
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.880]   practice Christmas, almost the whole world
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.480]   practices Christmas, not really understanding
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.640]   the significance of what it is.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.840]   And that's why we wanna take advantage of that,
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.080]   that while we celebrate Christmas,
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.600]   they're easy to ask.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.000]   Sometimes it may be hard to ask,
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.240]   like, "Do you wanna hear about God?"
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.800]   But when everybody's celebrating Christmas,
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.880]   to say, "This is what Christmas means."
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.560]   Right, and so the door kind of is open for us
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.760]   to be able to share the gospel.
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.640]   The reason why I share that is because
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.880]   Christmas is probably the most,
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.680]   I don't know if you wanna call it important,
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.000]   but the most celebrated,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.920]   that we make the biggest deal about Christmas.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.840]   You see it in decorations, commercials,
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.880]   everything that we do.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.920]   Our longest break, holiday break,
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.440]   is during the Christmas break.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.800]   The Jews also had something like Christmas
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.120]   in their culture, and what they had was
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.800]   the Day of Atonement.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.040]   So Day of Atonement was their biggest holiday.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.160]   So they would have the Passover,
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.480]   and that Passover would bleed into the Passover
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.800]   through the Day of Atonement.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.560]   And so they would take sometimes weeks and weeks off,
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.280]   sometimes months off, in order to travel
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.640]   to get to Jerusalem.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.120]   And so it was embedded into their culture
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.720]   so that every year they would share this with one another
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.000]   and remind each other of the significance of this.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   So at the center of their culture,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.200]   this Day of Atonement was embedded for a particular reason.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.560]   So here in Hebrews 13, 10 through 11, it says,
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.440]   "We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.080]   "have no right to eat."
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.280]   Let me stop right there.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.520]   If you studied with us the book of Leviticus,
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.520]   that's where the priests actually got their food.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.000]   People would bring sacrifices,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.160]   and they would take their livers
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.680]   and parts that they would normally not eat
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.040]   and take the meat part of it,
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.840]   and that portion belonged to the priest to eat.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.000]   So when he says, "We have an altar from which
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.400]   "those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat,"
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.560]   it's specifically relating to the sacrifice
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.400]   of the Day of Atonement.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.280]   Because that offering, they were not allowed to eat.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.480]   Every other offering, they were.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   So he's specifically referring to that.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.000]   And then verse 11, he said,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.320]   "For the bodies of those animals
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.420]   "whose blood is brought into the holy place
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.720]   "by the high priest as an offering for sin
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.080]   "are burned outside the camp."
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.120]   Again, any Jew who read that would right away understand
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.520]   he's referring to the sacrifice made
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.160]   on the Day of Atonement.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.520]   Most of you probably have heard
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.680]   the significance of this day,
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.440]   but I want to emphasize for you
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.560]   just how important this day is.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.160]   So if you can put up the chart for me, the next one.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.800]   So this is the chart of the tabernacle.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.840]   So right in there, you have the rectangle,
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   and that's the tabernacle.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.320]   So those of you who have bad eyes, that's what it says.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.240]   And then around that are the 12 tribes.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.000]   So those are the names of the tribes there.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.240]   If you read the Book of Numbers,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.920]   that's exactly how the tribe was organized.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.960]   So every time that they settle in,
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.200]   they are to be in that order.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.880]   And so the tabernacle was right at the center.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.840]   So whenever they moved, they would march like military,
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.960]   one tribe after the other.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.160]   And then when they would settle down,
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.680]   they would put the tabernacle, and everybody would settle.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.560]   So every time they settled in for any period of time,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.000]   and the tabernacle was established,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.800]   that's what the Israelites looked like
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.200]   in 40 years in the desert.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.120]   In the 40 years while they were in the desert,
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.680]   obviously God placed a tabernacle in the center for a reason,
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.560]   because everyone had equal access to the tabernacle.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.240]   So at the tabernacle,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.280]   what was at the center of the tabernacle?
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.120]   The sacrifices, right?
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.800]   The whole purpose of the Book of Leviticus
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.120]   was to give instructions on how to give sacrifices
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.160]   to be able to draw near to God.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.880]   In the sacrifices, what's at the center?
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.720]   Those of you who studied with us in Leviticus.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.400]   Day of Atonement.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.160]   So if you remember,
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.320]   as we studied through the Book of Leviticus,
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.640]   Leviticus is designed, is instructed to us
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.600]   in a chiastic format.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.120]   So some of you who are A students may remember that.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.600]   So if you can put up the chiastic structure,
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.360]   this is basically the outline of the Book of Leviticus.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.520]   Okay, and this is one of those books that,
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.360]   you know, a lot of Christians
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.520]   who've been Christian for many years
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.680]   still are very mystified by it
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.320]   because it's hard to understand.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.800]   But when you understand what God was doing
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.200]   in the Book of Leviticus,
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.920]   it really is very, very important
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.880]   in understanding what's happening in the New Testament.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.320]   He writes it in a chiastic form.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.000]   And so chiastic form basically means
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.280]   that it's kind of like the crescendo, right?
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.640]   Those of you guys who are into music, which I am not,
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.280]   but I know enough about to know what a crescendo is.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.440]   Crescendo is basically you're kind of,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.800]   the music is playing and it's building up to a peak, right?
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.520]   And so that peak, you're supposed to,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.340]   you'll normally hear the drums
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.560]   or the music getting a little bit louder
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.200]   or if you're playing the guitar
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.040]   and at the peak of it, you get the cymbals go boom.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.680]   And that's the crescendo.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.240]   And so when you think of the music,
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.560]   when there's a crescendo in the music,
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.200]   you know like that's kind of like the peak.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.560]   So the chiastic structure of a book
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.320]   is kind of like a crescendo.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.080]   So everything is building up to the center.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.080]   So the main point of the Book of Leviticus,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.600]   crescendo at chapter 16 at the Day of Atonement
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.580]   and then after that, it kind of re-explains
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.360]   the different laws pointing back to the Day of Atonement,
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.000]   how this ought to be practiced.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.360]   Now why is this so important?
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.800]   Because at the center of Israel was the tabernacle
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.240]   and at the center of the tabernacle was the sacrifices
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.340]   and at the center of the sacrifices
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.580]   was the Day of Atonement.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.840]   Now at the center of the Day of Atonement
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.040]   was the two sacrifices, the two goats
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.760]   that was offered up and one was offered up
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.520]   and the blood that that goat would shed,
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.000]   the high priest would take that,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.480]   take it into the Holy of Holies
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.800]   and sprinkle the mercy seat,
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.080]   which he could only go in once a year,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.480]   symbolizing that the blood of this goat
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.280]   is going to cover the mercy seat
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.960]   and atone for the sins of Israel where there was inaccess.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.240]   And all of this is role-playing
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.960]   so that we can understand that blood had to be shed
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.520]   for the purpose of access to God.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.820]   The second goat, where we call the scapegoat,
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:51.440]   where Aaron, the high priest, would put both hands on it,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.400]   representing the sins of Israel
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.240]   and take that goat outside the camp
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.080]   and remove it far, far away.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.700]   They said over 10 miles away
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.160]   so that they could no longer see it
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.920]   and cast it outside the camp.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.180]   So what it symbolized in the Day of Atonement was,
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:08.520]   because of the sacrifice of this goat,
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.400]   that sins of Israel is cast out of Israel.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.080]   So when the author of Hebrews says here,
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.420]   "We have an altar from which those who serve the tavern
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.600]   "have no right to eat,"
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.280]   the Israelites would have right away understood
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.440]   he's talking about the Day of Atonement.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.560]   What I just shared with you
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.720]   isn't just about the Book of Leviticus.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.800]   What about these two goats,
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.780]   one sacrifice and the other goat
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.420]   being cast out of the camp,
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.740]   is not only at the center of the tabernacle,
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.060]   it's not only at the center of the Day of Atonement,
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.360]   it's at the center of redemptive history.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.780]   All of this is to point to Christ
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.900]   in what he was going to do.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.180]   So as the Day of Atonement and the sacrifice
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.580]   crescendoed on that sacrifice,
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.160]   all of redemptive history crescendos
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.600]   in Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.120]   And then after that, everything in the Old Testament
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.900]   is the preparation for Christ's coming and his death.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.860]   Everything after the Gospels is pointing back to the cross
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.420]   of what happened and the effects of that.
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.040]   So all of this is being role-played to point to Christ.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.520]   And that's what he means by that those animals
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.220]   whose blood is brought into the holy place
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.800]   by high priests as an offering for sin
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.600]   and burned outside the camp, was taken outside the camp,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.000]   and he says, "Therefore, Jesus also,
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.080]   "that he might sanctify people through his own blood,
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.480]   "suffered outside the camp."
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.120]   In other words, he's saying Jesus is the fulfillment
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.000]   of that act.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.900]   That's what he's saying.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.360]   Everything that you've been learning about this
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.700]   was about Christ being taken outside the camp.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.260]   But you know what's interesting about this is
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:01.540]   that book crescendos and then it turns back,
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.540]   but the end of the book of Leviticus in chapter 26
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.440]   ends with a warning of blessing and cursing.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.300]   That if you obey, that here are the blessings
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.440]   that will come to you, and if you disobey and break the law,
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.800]   then here are the curses that will come to you.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.260]   But the interesting thing about this is
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.960]   there's about 13 verses that talk about God's blessing.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.080]   And there's over 50 some verses that talk about God's curse.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.820]   If you read through the book of Deuteronomy,
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.700]   you see the similar breakdown where you'll see
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.780]   a couple chapters about God's blessing
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.340]   and many, many chapters about God's curses.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.700]   It's almost like God already knew where they were headed.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.320]   Because everything that he's doing with the nation of Israel
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.280]   it says it is a shadow of the reality to come.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.360]   And so we already know that God gave them the law
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.080]   for what purpose?
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.200]   So that they can obey and have life?
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.560]   No.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.160]   He said God gave the law so that you may understand
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.960]   sin to be utterly sinful.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.340]   So everything that he's doing here is kind of a role playing
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.180]   so that when Christ comes that people would understand
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.460]   the curse that they're under.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:23.360]   And Israel's whole history is to demonstrate that
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.760]   so that it can point to the reality in Christ.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.560]   So what I want to do this morning is look at the text
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.640]   that he's referring to, look at the blessings
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.760]   that he desires for us and the curse he says
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.200]   that we're going to be under.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.360]   In Leviticus chapter 26 verses one to 13
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.000]   and it summarizes in three ways.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.160]   One, God will provide a rain in their season
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.860]   so that they will bear much fruit.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.460]   Two, verse six through eight,
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.100]   God will give them peace in the land.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.640]   And then three, verse nine and 10,
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.200]   God will grant them to be fruitful and to multiply
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.740]   because he will walk among them.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.980]   When you summarize the three points of God's blessing
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.240]   what does it sound like?
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.300]   Okay.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.860]   Think for a second, critical thinking for a minute.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.020]   What does those blessings sound like?
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.980]   You're going to be fruitful, you're going to multiply, right?
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.180]   And the Lord is going to be among you.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.820]   Sounds like the Garden of Eden, right?
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.680]   That was God's intent.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.700]   So when you are obedient and God blesses you
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.900]   and his presence is among you,
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.700]   that everything you do you're going to be fruitful,
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.220]   you're going to multiply because the Lord is with you.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.420]   But then he turns immediately to verse 14 to 39
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.980]   and he warns them, but if you do not obey,
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.140]   the curse of God will be upon you.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.340]   In verse 14 and 16 it says this,
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.380]   but if you do not obey me
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.900]   and do not carry out all these commandments,
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.940]   if instead you reject my statutes
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.460]   and if your soul abhors my ordinances
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.900]   so as not to carry out all my commandments
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:01.900]   and so break my covenant, I in turn will do this to you.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.180]   Now I want to emphasize here
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.920]   that each one of these warnings, these curses,
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.700]   emphasizes God saying, I will do this to you.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.860]   You know, again, we're in a culture
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.320]   where we want to minimize God's culpability
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.340]   to his punishment so he created heaven
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.060]   but we kind of minimize hell.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.980]   God blesses and he shows grace
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:30.460]   but in kind of like judgment kind of just happens.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.940]   So God's judgment is him just not blessing you.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.740]   That's not what it says.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.380]   He said, I will bless you if you obey my commandment
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:42.020]   but he says, I will curse you if you disobey.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.240]   So I want you to notice that there's five separate phases
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.420]   of God's curse in chapter 26
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.260]   and each one of these curses, he emphasizes, I will do this.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.300]   So the first phase comes in verse 16 and 17
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.080]   and he says, I in turn will do this to you.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.540]   I will appoint over you a sudden terror,
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.460]   consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.580]   and cause the soul to pine away.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.300]   Also, you will sow your seed uselessly
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.100]   for your enemies will eat it up.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.260]   I will set my face against you
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.180]   so that you will be struck down before your enemies
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.300]   and those who hate you will rule over you
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.520]   and you will flee when no one is pursuing you.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.620]   I think this section can be summarized
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.380]   by God disturbing their peace.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.260]   The shalom is broken, the Sabbath is broken
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.380]   and that's exactly what the Bible says.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.660]   As soon as Adam and Eve rebelled against God,
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.260]   the Sabbath that God took them into was broken.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.420]   So from that day on, mankind is walking around,
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.900]   we buy homes, we put money away in our bank accounts,
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.500]   all of it in order so that we may have some peace.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:59.460]   We look for jobs, we pursue, we fight, we struggle
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.700]   and at the core of it, we're trying to reestablish
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.820]   the Sabbath that was broken.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:05.300]   But God says, when you disobey,
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.900]   your peace doesn't come from living in a peaceful country
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.900]   or not being in war or having a nice home to stay.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:15.380]   He said the peace is disturbed because of sin.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.740]   Because true peace is only found in Christ
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.620]   and when he's there.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.900]   So when he says, I will take away my presence,
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.780]   he said even when the enemy is not pursuing you,
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:28.660]   you will flee because your peace has been disturbed.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:31.400]   And he said that's the first thing that will happen.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.520]   No sense of security.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.680]   There's always sense of anxiety.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.360]   Even when there is no turmoil,
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.960]   there is a sense that something's gonna happen.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.740]   So when you're rich, you're afraid
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.620]   that you're gonna lose your money
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.000]   and if you don't have money,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.640]   you're afraid that you're not gonna get it.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.260]   And so no matter what financial situation you're in,
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.660]   there's never any peace because true peace
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.820]   can only be found in the presence of Christ.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.460]   And so he says, when you rebel against me
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:02.020]   and the curse comes upon you, peace will be disturbed.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.020]   But secondly, verse 18 to 20, he says,
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.540]   but when that happens and you don't recognize that
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.580]   and you don't repent, you don't turn to me,
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.700]   he says in verse 18, I will,
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.720]   if they do not turn from their sins
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.140]   and after the first set of judgment,
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.900]   the punishment will increase sevenfold.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.620]   So it's not level one and level two.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.720]   He says, no, I've given you opportunity,
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.420]   but I really want you to know how serious this curse is.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.780]   And he says it will increase it sevenfold.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:34.680]   Verse 19 and 20 says, I will break down your pride of power.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.980]   I will also make your sky like iron
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.980]   and your earth like bronze.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.420]   What he means by that, he's gonna dry up the sky
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.660]   and the ground is not gonna bear any fruit.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.660]   So there's gonna be famine in the land.
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.160]   Your strength will be spent uselessly
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.440]   for your land will not yield its produce
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.240]   and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.020]   Do you remember in Genesis chapter three,
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.420]   when God brings curse upon mankind,
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.500]   he says to Adam that you will work the ground
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.300]   by the sweat of your brow
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.500]   and all it's going to produce is thorns and thistles.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.780]   And after that, you will go back to the ground
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.380]   and you will die.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.180]   So he's describing exactly the warning that he gave.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.260]   He said, this is going to happen.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:18.300]   He said, this is going to be fulfilled.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.100]   You're gonna labor all your life
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.780]   and you're gonna feel like you're not making any progress.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.020]   And he said, it wasn't simply
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.000]   because you made the wrong decision.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.260]   It wasn't simply because you didn't buy the right stock.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.280]   He said, it's because you rebelled against me.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.940]   And then he says the third one, verse 21 to 22,
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:38.160]   if you still will not repent, he says in verse 21,
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.000]   I will increase this judgment,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.560]   these plagues sevenfold according to your sins.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.460]   Verse 22, I will let loose among you beasts of the field,
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.600]   which will bereave you of your children
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.120]   and destroy your cattle and reduce your numbers
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.240]   so that your roads lie deserted.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.520]   Do you remember at the Garden of Eden
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.960]   what Adam and Eve was doing?
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.760]   He said, they were laboring
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.760]   and the animals would come to them
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.560]   and he would name these animals.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.200]   So not only were they living in peace,
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.520]   Adam and Eve were ruling over the animals
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.900]   because God told them to, to be fruitful,
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.960]   to subdue the land.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.300]   Instead, these very creatures that God created
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:21.280]   for our enjoyment in creation will turn against you,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.600]   he says, and they will reduce the number of people.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.240]   They will attack you.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.080]   The very creation that God created for his glory
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.560]   is going to turn against you.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.640]   Fourthly, verse 23 to 26,
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.280]   is after all of this, you still will not repent,
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.000]   he says, God will act with hostility against them
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.440]   and will strike them sevenfold for their sins.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.880]   Verse 25 to 26, I will also bring upon you a sword
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.040]   which will execute vengeance for your covenant.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.920]   And when you gather together in your cities,
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.820]   I will send pestilence among you
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.400]   so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.160]   When I break your staff of bread,
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.840]   10 women will bake your bread in one oven
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.520]   and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.540]   so that you will eat and not be satisfied.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.120]   He said he's going to, if after all of that,
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.440]   you don't recognize that this is a judgment coming from God,
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.280]   he said, I will bring upon you pestilence.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.780]   I will bring upon you a pandemic.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.460]   And in that, it's going to lead to financial ruin
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.880]   where you're not gonna be able to find bread to eat.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.560]   He said, but even after that,
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.720]   you don't recognize the curse that you're in.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:42.500]   He says in 27 to 39, he said,
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.640]   if the previous judgment does not bring them to repentance
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.960]   and God will act wrathfully and will punish them sevenfold.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.760]   So seven times seven times seven times seven times seven.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.480]   He says, I will bring it in order for you to repent.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.080]   And then verse 29, he says,
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.840]   further, you will eat the flesh of your sons
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.680]   and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.140]   That's like unbelievable.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.440]   People of God who saw miracles with their own hands,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.920]   who crossed over the Red Sea,
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.480]   who've eaten miraculous bread and quail,
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.960]   they've seen the 10 plagues, God conquering the enemies,
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.000]   that they are going to degenerate to the point
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.760]   where they're going to practice cannibalism
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.320]   to their own children.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.720]   It's unbelievable that they would fall this far.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.360]   If you read anything about the Old Testament,
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.580]   you know that this actually happened in Israel's history.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.160]   This actually happened in Israel's history,
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.580]   exactly as God said.
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:42.640]   Further on, he says, anyone who's left in verse 39,
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.680]   so those of you who may be left will rot away
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.360]   because of their iniquity in the lands of the enemies
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.720]   and also because of the iniquities of their forefathers,
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.180]   they will rot away with them.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:57.320]   As horrendous as this thing is,
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.760]   does this remind you of anything else in the scripture?
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.080]   Judgment sevenfold, sevenfold, sevenfold, sevenfold?
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.400]   Yeah, Book of Revelation.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.160]   Book of Revelation tells us
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.580]   that the judgment starts with seven seals.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.100]   And at the end of that,
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.740]   there's gonna be seven trumpet judgments.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.020]   And after that, there's gonna be seven bowl judgments.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.740]   And every judgment is increasing in manner
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.020]   year after year after year after year.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.060]   So all that he is warning them to the nation of Israel,
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.460]   all that has happened to the nation of Israel,
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.140]   all was a shadow,
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.900]   shadow of the reality that's coming at the end.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.380]   So if you obey and repent, this will happen,
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.560]   but if you do not, here's what's coming.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.460]   But if you notice, every one of these warnings
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.920]   ultimately is to bring them to repentance.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.420]   If after you've seen this and you do not repent,
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.260]   if after the suffering you do not repent,
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:01.340]   if after you experience hardship, you do not repent,
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.180]   after you've gone all that and you still will not repent,
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.140]   the true judgment doesn't come with warning,
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.020]   it just happens.
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.460]   The white throne judgment comes
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.940]   and there's not a lot of talk after that
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:12.980]   because it's over.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.700]   Because either you're in heaven or hell at that point.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.980]   And so all of this is role-playing
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.940]   for the gospel that we are preaching today.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:27.080]   In Galatians chapter three, 10 through 13,
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.700]   Apostle Paul summarizes all of this and he says this,
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.140]   "For as many as are of the works of the law
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.460]   "are under a curse.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.160]   "For it is written, cursed is everyone
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.100]   "who does not abide by all things
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.140]   "written in the book of the law to perform them.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:42.920]   "Now that no one is justified by the law
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.200]   "before God is evident,
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.600]   "for the righteous man shall live by faith.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.320]   "However, the law is not of faith.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.820]   "On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by them."
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.880]   And then verse 13,
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.520]   "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.120]   "having become a curse for us.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.760]   "For it is written, cursed is everyone
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.260]   "who hangs on a tree."
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:06.180]   All that drama of the sacrifices,
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.660]   all that drama of the day of atonement.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.820]   Every single year, sacrificing that goat
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:14.780]   and then allowing that scapegoat to go.
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.740]   All of it was to point to what Christ
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.420]   was going to do on the cross.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.820]   That he became the curse for us
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.540]   so that we might become the righteousness of God.
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:28.660]   And that's what he means in Isaiah 53,
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.860]   in the Old Testament, speaking about their Messiah,
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:35.300]   he was despised and forsaken of men,
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:38.420]   a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.500]   And like one from whom men hide their face,
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.900]   he was despised and we did not esteem him.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.740]   Surely our griefs he himself bore,
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.620]   our sorrows he carried,
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.200]   our curse he carried.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.460]   Yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken,
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:58.420]   smitten of God and afflicted.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:05.100]   Years ago, before my father passed away,
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.820]   he had a heart attack.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.100]   And so we took him to a hospital in Corona
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.260]   and he was there probably about 10 days recovering.
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.540]   And so we were bringing him back home
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.540]   and I happened to live in Corona at that time.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.020]   And so we had a nice backyard,
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:23.980]   so we kind of let my dad rest there in front of the pool,
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:27.060]   just enjoying and just relaxing before he can go home.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.820]   And so by that time, our children were very young.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.220]   So my oldest was probably no more than four,
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.260]   at most five years old,
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.660]   and they didn't know how to swim yet.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:36.860]   And so after we were resting,
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:41.500]   we all went inside to eat and only Jeremy, my oldest,
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500]   my father was sitting outside.
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.420]   And as we're inside, we hear this large splash.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.340]   And we knew it wasn't Jeremy
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.060]   because it was a pretty large splash.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:53.380]   And then we all in shock went out
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.020]   thinking something bad happened.
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.660]   And we got out just in time to see my dad in the pool,
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.760]   pulling Jeremy out of the water, right?
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:06.140]   And again, he had a heart attack and he was coming,
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:09.020]   he was just resting in our home and he was soaking wet.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:12.540]   And so we saw him grab him from the back of his shirt
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.540]   and just pulling him out of the water.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.780]   So obviously we're all shocked.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.540]   And if my dad wasn't sitting there,
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.140]   Jeremy would have drowned.
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:20.620]   He said, my dad just turned his head.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.660]   He said he was in the water just floating like this
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:23.760]   and didn't know what to do.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.520]   So he would have drowned.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.700]   So we're all in shock.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.900]   You know, it's like, oh my gosh, is Jeremy okay?
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:31.140]   Oh my gosh, is my dad okay?
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.540]   And we're trying to take care of them.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.660]   Jeremy comes out of the water and he shakes off the water.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.860]   He turns around and says, thanks, Harabuji.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.060]   And then he just walks in.
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.460]   (audience laughing)
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:42.700]   He had no idea what happened.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.980]   He almost died.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.340]   If Harabuji wasn't sitting there, he would have drowned
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.580]   'cause we're all inside.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.740]   And all he knew is like, thanks, Harabuji.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.740]   And he just walked inside, just changed his clothes,
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.340]   went out playing and ate and ran with the other kids.
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:01.040]   And to this day, like we freaked out because of that.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.940]   So we started locking our doors
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.580]   and we made sure none of our kids went out.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:07.060]   They said, we're never gonna buy a house
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.420]   with a swimming pool again.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.780]   Because we were so shocked by that.
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.060]   We were traumatized by that experience.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.900]   But Jeremy is like, thanks, Harabuji.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:19.940]   Now, because he was young, he was a kid,
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:23.620]   he didn't know what just happened.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:27.020]   And to this day, he doesn't have any traumatic experiences.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.700]   I asked him after the first service, do you remember that?
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.140]   He's like, oh yeah.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.100]   (audience laughing)
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:32.340]   You know, you almost died.
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:33.220]   He's like, yeah.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.860]   (audience laughing)
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.340]   'Cause it wasn't traumatic for him.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.960]   He just got a lot of attention that day.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.620]   The reason why I share this is because
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.300]   what is the purpose of the crescendo?
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.400]   Is to bring attention to the peak.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.700]   See, everything that God has been doing
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.160]   was to prepare for what he was doing at the cross
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.540]   so that we don't just come along and say,
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:58.140]   you know, God loved you, has a wonderful plan for your life
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:58.980]   and he died.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.460]   He said, oh, okay, thank you.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.620]   Part of the reason why the sacrifice of Christ
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:11.460]   and him taking the curse upon himself
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.380]   is because we don't fully understand the curse
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:18.060]   that we are under without Christ.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.620]   Everything that he mentions there
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.420]   about lacking peace, working hard,
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.440]   and everything turning into thorns and thistles.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.140]   Enemies coming after us, pestilence coming,
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:33.140]   fear of death, meaninglessness.
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:35.900]   All of this is a description of mankind
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.140]   outside of Christ that you and I deserved.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.260]   And he played this drama out in the nation of Israel
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.900]   year after year after year,
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.260]   animal after animal after animal,
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.660]   so that it would be so saturated in their psyche
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.820]   that when Christ came, that they understood
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:57.780]   that he came to take away that from me.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.940]   So that at his death, there would be celebration and praise.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:07.020]   But because the nation of Israel did not understand,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.060]   they praised him going to the cross,
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.360]   but they abandoned him when he was at the cross
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.860]   'cause they did not understand what was happening.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:17.180]   But the question is, do you understand?
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:22.260]   Do we understand that everything that was written here
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.300]   was ultimately for us?
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.280]   So that we would respond to him by saying, "Hallelujah.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.280]   "Thank you for saving me."
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.600]   Do you remember?
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.440]   Do you remember what it was like before you knew Christ?
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.440]   Have you forgotten?
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.360]   Maybe some of you just kinda grew up in the church
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.200]   and maybe there's a deep memory,
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.920]   but I think most of us have some recollection
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:54.200]   what it was like when you didn't know Jesus.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.920]   How desperate you were.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.560]   How lonely you were.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.320]   How hurt you were.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.460]   How bitter you were.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.040]   How angry you were.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.960]   Maybe some of us have forgotten
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.960]   what it is that we have been saved from
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.040]   and what it is that we have been saved to.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.920]   And that's the whole point of what he's been trying,
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.060]   saying all this time.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.340]   Why would you go back to the old system
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.640]   when all of that was to prepare you to bring you to Christ?
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.560]   All of Hebrew is to prepare for this passage
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.280]   so that you and I can understand
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.960]   and celebrate and to worship.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.100]   That's what he means when he says,
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.640]   "Live up to the gospel that's been given to you.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.240]   "Don't ever forget.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.120]   "Don't ever forget."
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.320]   That's why he says, "Because Christ has done this
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.520]   "and he took the curse that you and I deserved,"
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.800]   he says in verse 13 and 14,
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.460]   "so let us go out to him outside the camp,
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.460]   "bearing his reproach.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.740]   "For here we do not have a lasting city,
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.840]   "but we are seeking the city which is to come."
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.800]   As Christ came outside the camp,
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.660]   he turned what ought to have been a curse
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.140]   into the greatest blessing of mankind.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:19.120]   He took what anybody, every time in the Old Testament
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.560]   when it says he was taken outside the camp,
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.080]   that was the ultimate judgment to any Israelite.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.560]   That you can be reprimanded,
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.800]   you can be disciplined for a period,
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.440]   but once they go outside the camp, there's no hope.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.360]   So every time, only the harshest punishments
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.220]   were given outside the camp.
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:40.680]   And it was not by accident that Jesus was dragged
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.800]   outside of camp at Golgotha.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.340]   And he says, "As he was crucified,
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:49.480]   "as he took on the curse,
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.200]   "as he took on our sins,
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.180]   "he reverses this curse at the cross,
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:57.500]   "and he turns it into a blessing."
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:00.960]   Drinking the blood and eating the flesh,
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.320]   as Jesus says in John chapter 16,
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.120]   would have been the most sacrilegious thing
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.880]   that a Jewish rabbi would ask of his disciples.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.860]   And yet he says, "If you do not eat of my flesh
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:12.700]   "and drink of my blood,
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.320]   "you have no relationship with me."
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.720]   So he took one of the most sacrilegious things
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:21.080]   and turned it into a place of life.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.520]   He says, "He who seeks to be the greatest
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.060]   "in the kingdom of God will be the least."
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.380]   Think about how much we're trying so hard
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.700]   to get ahead in life, to buy a better house,
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.200]   to have better vacations,
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.200]   and we get trapped in this rat race,
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:41.200]   and Jesus comes in, and he turns this rat race upside down.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.920]   And he who tries to be the greatest will be the least,
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.060]   and he who is the least will be the greatest
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.320]   in the kingdom of God.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.340]   We try so hard to live and make something of ourselves,
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.020]   and he says, "He who finds his life will lose it.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:56.600]   "He who loses his life for my sake will find it."
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:02.660]   Only Christ has that power to change the curse of man
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:03.920]   into the blessing of God.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:10.280]   Those of you guys who are old enough remember
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.840]   the disaster that happened in Chernobyl reactor.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.160]   Some of you guys may have read about it,
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.680]   some of you guys lived through it.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.120]   Not that you were there, but you're old enough
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.680]   to remember when that happened.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.960]   In 1986, April 26th, one of the reactors blew up,
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.280]   and all kinds of radiation leaked out
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.620]   of this nuclear reactor.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:34.840]   And out of that, over 31 people died directly,
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.340]   and since then, they have counted.
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:37.820]   They believe it's much more than this,
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:42.040]   but they said that over 20,000 people contracted cancer
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.760]   as a direct result of this leak.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.440]   Over 40 years later, they're still afraid.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.780]   They don't know how long this effect's going to be.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.600]   But to this day, they're not gonna plant there,
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.840]   'cause they don't know how much radiation
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.280]   is still stuck on the ground,
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.040]   because it didn't just affect the air.
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.240]   It affected the building, it affected the cattle,
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.840]   it affected the roads, it affected the plants.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.180]   It affected everything.
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:10.780]   So even 40 years later, you would be out of your mind
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.640]   to buy property there.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.480]   But if you see pictures of Chernobyl,
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.120]   they've been trying hard.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.760]   They rebuilt the infrastructure,
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.960]   they rebuilt the buildings.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.500]   They're trying to get people to come back.
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.080]   And the property's cheap.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.320]   You can understand why it would be so cheap.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.520]   But they can't get people to come back.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.440]   Nobody in their right mind,
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.360]   unless they were born into that,
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.700]   no one's gonna move to Chernobyl.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:38.240]   Only missionaries would go a place like that
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.980]   to bring the gospel.
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:44.280]   We can understand why people would not move there.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.920]   We can understand why people would not invest there.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.340]   Because it's been affected by radiation.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:57.080]   When he says, "Christ went outside the camp
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.640]   "to reverse this curse,
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.440]   "and he invites us all to come outside the camp,"
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.280]   he's basically telling us,
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.440]   all of creation is under the condemnation of this sin.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.940]   It's under a curse.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.920]   So why would you invest and build
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.440]   and place your hope,
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.440]   no matter how cheap the property is?
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:20.120]   'Cause all of this is condemned.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.320]   That's exactly what it says in Romans 8, 20 to 24.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.120]   "For the creation was subjected to futility,
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.980]   "not willingly, but because of him who subjected it,
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:31.580]   "in hope that the creation itself also will be set free
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.740]   "from its slavery to corruption,
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:36.180]   "into the freedom of the glory of the children of God."
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:39.500]   All of creation has been directly affected
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.240]   by the sin of mankind.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.080]   And he said, "God will restore it when man is restored."
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:48.480]   And that's why he says, "Come out.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.480]   "Come out."
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.060]   If you recognize the curse of mankind,
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.240]   he said, "Come out."
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.440]   Because the place that you envy,
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.200]   the place that you covet,
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.240]   the place that you are putting your hope in
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.920]   has been condemned
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:06.420]   until he restores it when he comes back.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:09.560]   So in other words, invest in eternity.
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.760]   Come out.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:16.240]   How much of our struggle and anxiety,
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.320]   marriage problems, relational issues
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:24.240]   are directly linked to us coveting this condemned world?
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.480]   See, the Israelites, they prided themselves of Jerusalem.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.600]   This is the city of God.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.720]   This is where the Messiah's going to come.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.080]   And that's why they were celebrating,
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.320]   "Hosanna, hosanna," when Christ came.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.920]   Because they thought he was going to reconquer Jerusalem
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.440]   in the name of God,
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.640]   and they were going to be the top dog.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.560]   And when Jesus gave himself up,
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.140]   they could not understand.
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:55.320]   Why would you do that?
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.120]   You're finally gonna answer our prayers.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.500]   Finally, we're gonna be on the top.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.320]   And Jesus becomes a servant to the point of death.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.840]   They did not understand that our real sin,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.440]   our real problem was not the economy,
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.020]   was not the Roman government, but it's ourselves.
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:19.560]   We have been corrupted by our own sins.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:23.460]   And the only answer to that is Christ crucified.
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.040]   That's why he says in 1 Corinthians 15, 19,
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.120]   he says, "If we have hoped in Christ in this life only,
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.960]   "we are all men most to be pitied."
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.840]   To come out.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.800]   To come out.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:43.960]   Even if you work hard, make the right investments,
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.640]   put away enough money, and you become wildly successful,
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.920]   and you become the top dog,
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.440]   we become the top dog on a dong hill.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.400]   That has been condemned.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.760]   The reason why I think some of us
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.580]   don't get affected by this is either
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.640]   we have been so saturated with temptation of this world,
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.900]   and it's become so mundane
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:14.040]   that it's hard for us to muster up any emotions
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.460]   because we've become so inoculated
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:19.460]   by the truth that we profess to believe.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:24.400]   Or we don't really believe this.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:29.120]   And we're trying to pretend like we believe it.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.820]   So we're trying to pretend and go through the motions.
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:37.660]   But if you really believe this, how can this not affect you?
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:41.540]   How can we be so concerned
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:45.600]   about making it in this world?
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:51.500]   How can we be so concerned about building on land
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:54.080]   that is contaminated by radiation?
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.860]   Come out.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.620]   Come out.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.380]   Come to Christ.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.900]   Find His refuge in Him.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.840]   Embrace the Christ who reversed this curse.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.820]   In Hebrews 11, 13 to 16, it says,
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.740]   all these, all these men and women of faith have died
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:17.340]   without receiving the promise, but having seen them,
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.340]   and having welcomed them from a distance,
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.540]   and having confessed that they were strangers
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.340]   and exiles on the earth, for those who say such things
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:28.140]   make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:31.260]   And indeed, if they had been thinking of that country
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.300]   from which they went out,
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.040]   they would have had opportunity to return.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.060]   But as it is, they desire a better country,
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.340]   that is, a heavenly one.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.780]   Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:46.740]   for He has prepared a city for them.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:53.060]   Let's live consistent with what we profess.
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.740]   Because the whole world sees it.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:00.440]   You know, when we live in hypocrisy,
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.760]   everybody else notices first before we do.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.360]   We sing songs, memorize scripture, we celebrate,
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.320]   we tell people to come to church,
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.860]   but non-Christians see right through our hypocrisy.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:16.840]   You don't really believe what you're trying to tell me.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.720]   'Cause if you're telling me to come outside the camp,
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.080]   why are you in the camp?
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.060]   If you believe that blessing is outside the camp,
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:28.960]   why are you fighting so hard to make it inside the camp?
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.000]   To come out, to come out.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.140]   Our refuge is with Him.
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.040]   Our life is with Him.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.600]   Our life is now hidden with Christ.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.360]   But when He comes in glory, we will be glorified with Him.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.320]   So during this Christmas season,
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.480]   let's redeem what God has implanted in our culture.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.620]   Let's redeem this opportunity,
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:56.120]   so when people ask us, "Why do you celebrate Christmas?"
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.520]   that we can tell them the hope that we have in Christ.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.680]   Yes, we'll buy gifts, we'll celebrate,
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.280]   we'll get together with our brothers and sisters
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.400]   and family members, but in the midst of all of that,
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:11.400]   let's not forget why we celebrate.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.960]   Christ came, He who knew no sin,
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.480]   became sin for us, so that you and I
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:19.920]   may become the righteousness of God.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.720]   And let's have every part of that
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.460]   make an impact in our hearts and in our lives.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.680]   If you would take a minute to pray with me.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:36.440]   Again, as our worship team leads us,
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.480]   if I can ask you to take a minute
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.680]   to surrender your life to Christ,
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:48.960]   what have you coveted in your heart
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.560]   that's squeezing out and quenching the Holy Spirit?
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.520]   Coveting isn't just about material things.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.680]   You can covet other people's affections,
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.280]   you can covet your leisure time,
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.120]   you can covet material things,
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:10.280]   you can covet other families,
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.380]   you can covet the past, you can covet the future.
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:19.240]   But when coveting takes hold of our hearts,
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.940]   it squeezes out the powerful work of Christ.
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.840]   So let's come before the Lord and surrender.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.460]   If we really believe that Christ is life,
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.960]   does our life reflect our confession?
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.200]   So let's take some time to pray and to reflect
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.320]   and to surrender as our worship team leads us.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.160]   Let's pray.

[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:07.460]   help us, Lord God, to exalt Christ
