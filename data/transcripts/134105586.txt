[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Then to 1 Corinthians 5,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800]   I'm gonna read the passage for us.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.160]   And, you know, if you,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.940]   what's really interesting is, you know,
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.320]   there are parts of scripture where it's awesome
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.720]   to slowly and methodically go through
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.760]   every phrase and every word.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.200]   And then there are parts of scripture where if you do that,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.800]   you just feel like you're getting beat up, you know?
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.120]   And there's a sense in which we've been together studying
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.680]   now for over 10 weeks, this is our 11th week.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.480]   And for the vast majority of it,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.920]   it's been like, you prideful, you know,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.160]   like arrogant people competing with each other.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.480]   How dare you do this to the house of God, you know,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.720]   like the temple of the Lord.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.720]   And it's been really heavy.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.120]   And just to give you a heads up,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.960]   it's gonna be like that for a little bit, okay?
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   But there's a sense in which I always felt like
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.560]   there are different parts of the scripture
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.040]   that's like that.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.080]   There's a sense in which sometimes we have to go
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.960]   through that experience, not just so that, you know,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.640]   we feel ashamed, but through the whole experience
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840]   of like really seeing how heavy and how weighty
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.800]   some of the words of scripture are.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.000]   Really seeing then also by implication how heavy and weighty
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.440]   the sin and theological topics are.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.720]   It helps us appreciate all the more
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.360]   the kind of conviction we get
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.400]   and also it helps us appreciate all the more
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.840]   the kind of transformation that results
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.480]   from the end of that kind of conviction, okay?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.440]   I just wanted to say that 'cause there are parts,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.920]   for me too, as I'm studying, I'm like,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.840]   man, he's laying on thick, you know?
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.880]   And just wanted to mention that.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.360]   Now let's read this passage, chapter five,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.640]   verse one through 13.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.440]   It is actually, and you know what, actually,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.360]   you know what I'm gonna do?
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240]   I'm gonna start in verse 21 of chapter four.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.960]   What do you want?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.680]   Okay, what do you desire?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.800]   Shall I come to you with a rod or with love
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.080]   and a spirit of gentleness?
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.400]   It is actually reported that there is immorality among you,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.040]   an immorality of such a kind that does not even exist
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   among the Gentiles, that someone has his father's wife.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   so that the one who had done this deed
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   would be removed from your midst.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920]   For I on my part, though absent in body,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.960]   but present in spirit, have already judged him
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.520]   who has so committed this, as though I were present.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.600]   In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.240]   and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.920]   I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.040]   for the destruction of his flesh,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.600]   so that his spirit may be saved
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.520]   in the day of the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.160]   Your boasting is not good.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   Do you not know that a little leaven
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.080]   leavens the whole lump of dough?
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.440]   Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.720]   just as you are in fact unleavened.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.880]   For Christ, our Passover, also has been sacrificed.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.200]   Therefore, let us celebrate the feast,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.880]   not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.160]   and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.880]   of sincerity and truth.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.960]   I wrote you in my letter not to associate
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.640]   with immoral people.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.600]   I did not at all mean with the immoral people
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.800]   of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.520]   or with idolaters, for then you would have
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.480]   to go out of the world.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.720]   But actually, I wrote to you not to associate
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.240]   with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.360]   or covetous, an idolater, a reviler,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.200]   a drunkard or swindler, not even to eat with such a one.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.160]   For what have I to do with judging outsiders?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.920]   Do you not judge those who are within the church?
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   But those who are outside, God judges.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.720]   Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.560]   Okay.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.760]   So let's begin taking a look, a closer look
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.520]   at this passage that we've seen.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.020]   Pretty heavy hitting rebuke.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.160]   We look at verse one and two, and I would like you
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.280]   just to do a quick exercise.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.520]   In verse one and two, where it says,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.760]   it is actually reported that there is immorality
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.240]   among you, an immorality of such a kind
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.200]   as that does not even exist among the Gentiles,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.680]   that someone has his father's wife,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.860]   you have become arrogant and have not mourned instead,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.360]   so that the one who had done this deed
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.940]   would be removed from your midst.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.360]   What I'd like you to do is just simply underline
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.660]   the most important concepts in verse one and two.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.560]   Okay.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.000]   Okay.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.440]   So as you guys do that, remember all the things
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.200]   that we've been kind of, again, rehearsing
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.160]   with you guys and reviewing.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.280]   Main verbs are very important.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.660]   Significant broad terms.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.320]   Main phrases that he's getting at, those are important, okay?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.000]   Repeated words are important.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.760]   Okay.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.440]   Now, after you've done that, basically,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.360]   if you've underlined the most important terms
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.600]   in those first two verses, you're pretty much getting at
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   what is the problem Apostle Paul is addressing, okay?
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.960]   So my first question to you is, what is Apostle Paul,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.440]   oh, I wrote it like, what is Apostle Paul upset about?
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.500]   He is pretty upset, okay?
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.840]   But what problems is he addressing?
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.320]   Anybody?
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.000]   Immorality, okay?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.600]   So the first term you should have underlined
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.800]   is probably just immorality.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.760]   He says, this exists among you,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.120]   and then he starts defining immorality, okay?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.200]   So for your letter A, just write in immorality.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.000]   And how does he describe this?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   Just asking you to look at the passage
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.280]   and just throw out the, these are just, you know,
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   face value observations.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.700]   So how does he describe their immorality?
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.540]   Sorry?
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.500]   - Arrogant?
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.700]   - Does he describe the immorality as arrogant?
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.380]   In verse one, the little kind of dependent clauses
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.460]   that are there, the little phrases that are there.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.940]   - So bad, not even the pagans do it.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.180]   - So bad, not even the pagans do it, okay?
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.840]   So think about this immorality.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.260]   It's weird to think about that, right?
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.060]   That the church that's comprised of individuals
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.220]   who are supposed to be set apart,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.300]   drawn out from the world, set apart as holy to God,
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.980]   they're now practicing such things
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.740]   that aren't even named among the world, okay?
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.200]   And that namely is incest, okay?
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.340]   Now there's sometimes disagreement about,
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.320]   okay, does this young man have a woman
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.620]   that's like a stepmom?
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.820]   Maybe this is the father's second wife,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.020]   maybe the original mom died,
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.900]   or is he actually having sexual relations
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.180]   with his birth mom?
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.740]   Kind of crazy, right?
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.260]   A lot of, yeah, sorry, I saw your, yeah.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.580]   The cringe, like, ugh, it's nasty.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.460]   Well, the thing about it is, if you guys remember,
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.460]   like, in that culture, it wasn't uncommon for a man
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.500]   to marry like multiple times, okay?
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.460]   Secondly, in that culture, it wasn't uncommon
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.780]   for, let's say, a man to have a wife
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.400]   that's super young, right?
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.980]   'Cause you got these older men,
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.820]   and in that culture, the men had such kind of authority
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.460]   and power and say and all that kind of stuff,
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.420]   and women were so dependent, they didn't care.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.300]   Like, in our generation and culture,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.660]   it's kind of like, you know, we have an option.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.700]   The ladies can say, well, you don't fit the bill
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.460]   that I want, you don't fit the height,
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.660]   financial income, the look, and all that stuff.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.180]   It's like, forget you, you know?
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.300]   But back then, it was like, if you had a guy
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.600]   who owned a lot of property, but he just happened
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.720]   to be older, that wasn't like a deal breaker.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.280]   So you would have a scenario where, let's say,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.600]   because of certain reasons, the father divorced
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.840]   the first wife, he marries a second,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.520]   but the second wife happens to be the same age as the son.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.360]   So in this kind of scenario, number one,
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.200]   a lot of commentators, again, I'm not like,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.160]   just pulling this out of, oh, hypothetic, I guess.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.820]   A lot of commentators are saying, this family
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.820]   is probably a family that's pretty well-to-do,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.380]   and it could be a scenario where the mom
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.140]   actually is like similar age as the son, okay?
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.580]   Now, I bring that kind of stuff up because
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.020]   I'm just kind of saying like, this could be a real scenario.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.020]   Okay, it could be a real scenario.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.880]   But the thing about it is, even in that culture, though,
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   that was not only just no good, it was incredibly shameful.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.720]   It was shameful.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.320]   Not only was there a culture like that,
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.020]   but also, let's put in some more details into that culture.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.480]   That culture is an incredibly high honor society.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.700]   Everything is about honor.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.440]   Everything is about prestige.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.460]   Everything is about that kind of sense of nobility.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.400]   For a son to do that, that's incredibly shameful, okay?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.620]   And so, Apostle Paul is sitting here like, flabbergasted.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.200]   And he's saying, blah, this stuff is happening in the church
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.360]   that's pagan to the pagans.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.920]   How can this be, right?
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.240]   And really, that kind of shows to us
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.720]   the church can find itself very, very, very far
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.340]   from the holy standards that God has called us to, okay?
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.400]   Now, someone mentioned the other one.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   What's the other thing that Apostle Paul
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.080]   is really upset about?
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   So, step one, he's really upset about the fact
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.280]   that there is sexual immorality amongst the people
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.840]   who are supposed to be holy.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.640]   But what's the second thing that he's really upset about?
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.760]   Arrogance, okay?
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.880]   He is upset about arrogance, and there's a sense
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.320]   in which you can say maybe he's even more upset.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.880]   How many of you guys have the NIV translation?
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.920]   You guys work off NIV?
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.800]   Okay, cool.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.120]   Do you mind reading verse two for us?
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.780]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:39.320]   Okay.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.360]   Thank you.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.240]   Sorry, yes, that's right.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.040]   I'm remembering it a little wrong, I think.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.380]   But there's an exclamation after you are proud, right?
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.400]   Okay, so that's what I'm remembering, all right.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.340]   So, the point I was trying to make was,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.320]   Apostle Paul might be very well more upset at the fact
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.200]   not so much that there is sin,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.320]   but that the people are arrogant about it, okay?
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.800]   Not so much that there's sin,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.840]   but the way that they respond to the sin is arrogant.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.860]   And in the NIV, it kind of captures
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.440]   what the Greek is trying to show.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.360]   And I'm not saying, again, you guys have to be like
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.320]   masters at Greek or whatever,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.880]   but sometimes comparing the translation just helps us.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.100]   Is there any kind of difference
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.320]   or things that we should note?
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.680]   And he is like saying, you're so proud, you know?
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.360]   You're so arrogant.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.480]   And there's an exclamation at that.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.180]   Now, my question to you is,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.280]   what is Apostle Paul identifying as pride in this scenario?
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.120]   Okay?
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.040]   Take a look at the verses surrounding it.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.280]   Take a look at verse one and two again.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.140]   What are some hints, what are some things
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.080]   that could perhaps shed some light for us
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   as to what is he calling arrogant in this scenario?
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.840]   (pages rustling)
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:02.640]   Yes?
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.240]   - Is it like their response to that sin?
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.240]   - Good.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.840]   It's their response to the sin.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.080]   Now, my question to you is,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.980]   can you put into more detail, how did they respond
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.980]   that would make them now be called arrogant?
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.280]   - They didn't do anything.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.680]   Just accepted it.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.200]   - Interesting.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.440]   They didn't do anything and they just accepted it.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.340]   Now, is that something you would call arrogant?
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:33.020]   What do you think has to happen in the mind and the thought
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.760]   that all of a sudden, just like,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.000]   I'm not gonna do anything about it,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.680]   and all of a sudden that's arrogant?
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.760]   Wouldn't that be just called like apathetic?
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.600]   Maybe insensitive?
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440]   Yes?
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.520]   - Like the absence of the fear of God is often
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   a sign of being arrogant.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.380]   - Excellent, okay.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.000]   That could definitely, did you guys hear that?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.120]   She says, when you don't do anything about something,
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.680]   when the law of God clearly says to do something,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.340]   then by that sin of omission,
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.000]   all of a sudden you've relegated God's law
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.920]   and you've placed your standard now above his.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.240]   'Cause essentially, you could be telling God like,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.120]   God, this is okay, don't have a cow.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.480]   And that's something very arrogant.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.960]   What else?
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.040]   - Somebody in our people pointed out that
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.840]   there's an arrogance in thinking that it won't hurt us,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.360]   which fits later with the idea of the leaven
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.760]   affecting the whole batch of dough.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.600]   - Okay.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.000]   - So, they think that having a sin in the church
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.520]   won't hurt them, it won't hurt the church.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.320]   And that's arrogant, because it will.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.520]   - Right.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.080]   Not having a sense of fear of like,
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.040]   oh, this is dangerous, right?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.760]   It's kinda like a kid who just doesn't think
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.640]   he's gonna ever get hurt, even though he's riding around
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.160]   with no helmet, no nothing, you know?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.560]   He thinks that although this exists in the church,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.640]   it's not gonna affect us anyway, so we're fine.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.320]   That's arrogant.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.840]   Is there anything else, maybe?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:10.680]   - Well, so you read the last verse from chapter four,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.800]   in the last, it's kind of like how last week
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.880]   you were talking about, like in verse 18,
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.400]   chapter four, it says, "Some are arrogant,
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.480]   "so I will not curse you, but I will not curse you,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.240]   "for I hold it in my heart with fear of Satan.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.080]   "If they were aware that he's not there
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.920]   "to be overseen and watch him and check,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.560]   "they claim I do whatever they want,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.360]   "so they feel like they know what's best,
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.000]   "and they feel like they're not standard."
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.120]   - Okay, good.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.360]   Absolutely, there is arrogance in thinking,
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.840]   no consequences, we're gonna do what we wanna do,
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.720]   we're gonna let's lie what we wanna let's lie,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.400]   because Apostle Paul, or nobody, can say nothing.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.500]   Okay, that's arrogant, too.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.280]   What about maybe something from this passage,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.500]   if you look at verse two, he says,
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.400]   "You have become arrogant," and then he ties that
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.120]   by saying, "and have not mourned instead."
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.300]   Okay?
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.460]   So, all those things that you guys mentioned,
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.500]   I appreciate you guys mentioning those things,
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.840]   because that kind of mentality and thinking
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.360]   is arrogant before the Lord.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   But then, Apostle Paul adds here,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.380]   basically, "You have become arrogant,
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.160]   "and your arrogant thinking caused you not to mourn."
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   What's mourn?
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.460]   You, so then, here it is, like progress, right?
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.780]   You're arrogant, so you didn't mourn,
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.560]   and so the end result didn't happen,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.080]   which is you should have dealt with this and removed him.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.040]   Okay?
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.500]   So what does that kinda imply to us
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.520]   as what he views as arrogance?
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.680]   (silence)
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:50.520]   Brokenness of sin.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.920]   Okay, do you wanna elaborate on that a little bit?
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.600]   - Sin doesn't really affect that as much,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.480]   or doesn't really--
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.800]   - What kind of sin?
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.040]   Trying to push you to what I personally want,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.080]   but think about this.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.560]   Apostle Paul sees them as his children, you know?
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.720]   And when you see your children,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.820]   at least just one of them, okay?
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.000]   When you see them, even just one of them hurting,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.120]   and then one of your kids comes up,
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.560]   after, let's just say, hypothetical scenario,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.720]   you have a bunch of kids, they all playing together,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.520]   and with little kids, what always ends up happening
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.720]   is someone hurts their head, you know?
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.800]   They're playing around, and then they run into something,
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.680]   they're playing around, they fall, they hit their head,
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.280]   and they're hurting bad, and they're crying,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.200]   and stuff like that, you know?
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.440]   You come running in, and you're like, "What happened?"
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.280]   And it's like, "Well, so and so, you know,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.760]   "Johnny hurt his head, he fell on the ground."
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.600]   It's like, "What'd you do?"
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.440]   It's like, "Nothing, how could you, nothing?
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.160]   "It's not my problem."
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.040]   What do you say to the child who says, "It's not my problem"?
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.600]   Well done, selfless little man.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.640]   He's like, "Ugh," like, you just reek of selfishness, right?
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.280]   It's like, "Your brother's hurting on the floor,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.320]   "he hurt his head, you didn't even call for me, you know?
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.720]   "You didn't go to see if he's okay,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.840]   "you just said, 'It's not my problem.'"
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.600]   Right?
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.000]   So really, when you're saying, like,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.240]   there's no brokenness over sin, what's really interesting,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.160]   it says there's no mourning, but there's no grieving
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.200]   in the sense that there's no grieving
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.400]   in that kind of sympathetic, this is our sin kind of way,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.240]   you know?
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   Like, there is no hurting together,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.920]   that Apostle Paul so many times has commanded the church,
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.340]   "I want you to hurt together, I want you to cry together,
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.880]   "I want you to rejoice together."
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.720]   Why?
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.540]   "Because you guys are together."
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.000]   But when somebody who's supposed to be together
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.680]   all of a sudden says, "But it ain't my problem,"
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.560]   it's prideful for a community person
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.960]   to think individualistically.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.360]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.320]   It's prideful for a brother to think individualistically.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.560]   So he says, like, "Ugh, that's gross,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.500]   "you slept with your stepmom?
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.360]   "It's not my problem, I don't want anything to do with you."
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.040]   That's arrogant, right?
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.600]   He just judges that person and says, "Ew, you're gross,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.160]   "but not my problem."
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.080]   That's arrogant.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.240]   To think in that kind of individualistic way
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.680]   is arrogance before Apostle Paul and the Lord.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.720]   And so what he says is,
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   and so when you don't have that sympathy,
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.580]   you're not gonna do anything about it, right?
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.140]   You're not gonna do anything about it.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.240]   When you don't have that personal association
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.360]   and say, "This is our guilt, this is our sin,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.080]   "and we grieve together, we hurt together,"
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   then you're not gonna do anything about it.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.600]   And so what Apostle Paul is essentially saying,
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.780]   in the A and in his B, he says,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.320]   "Oh, this is what I wanted you to read, sorry.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.760]   "Can you read verse,"
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.000]   wait, never mind.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.760]   Can you read verse two again?
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.040]   I feel like I'm totally missing something here.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.840]   Can you read verse two one more time?
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.680]   NIV.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.280]   - And you are proud.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.200]   Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.760]   and sadness out of your fellowship than man to resist?
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.440]   - Thank you, okay.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.160]   So in the A and A and S and B, it reads like,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.280]   you became arrogant and you have not mourned
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.120]   so that the one who did this would be removed.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.960]   In the NIV, Apostle Paul is direct and says,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.000]   "You're proud, shouldn't you have mourned?"
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.760]   You see the difference?
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.640]   Apostle Paul is making an exhortation,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.560]   saying, "Shouldn't you have mourned with your brother?"
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.680]   Okay?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.180]   I'll tell you from a personal experience.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.520]   I remember in college,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.160]   I think I've shared with you guys a lot of times
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.260]   that I struggled a lot with various things in college.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.800]   And I felt like I struggled with all kinds of arrogance
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.320]   and I felt like I also struggled with immorality.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.720]   I felt like I struggled with lack of self-control.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.040]   I'm not gonna say who because it could be
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.440]   potentially embarrassing and whatnot,
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.480]   but I remember there was a point
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.920]   where I was just really broken
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.020]   because in my college years, I felt like,
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.440]   oh, so frustrated with myself.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.120]   I kept sinning over the same thing
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.160]   again and again and again.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.280]   And every small group time we had, week to week,
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.160]   it was like the same old story.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.120]   And I felt guilty, ashamed, and embarrassed
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.920]   that I had to say the same prayer request
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.840]   again and again and again.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.000]   And so at one point or another,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.720]   I pulled aside this brother
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.440]   and I just made one of those really awkward moments
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.440]   where I just started crying.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   And I just started crying and I said,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.580]   it sucks that I just can't win.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.500]   It sucks that this sin is beating me up every week.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.880]   And this brother looked at me
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.140]   and all of a sudden, he just cried with me.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.640]   He just started crying with me.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.980]   And I remember crying together
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.120]   and after that, feeling so motivated.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:16.240]   It hurts to wrestle with sin to this degree,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.880]   but feeling his sympathy made me all the more motivated.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.240]   I'm gonna keep persevering.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.200]   I wanna, in this moment,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.160]   just think about that for a moment and move on.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   Apostle Paul is not simply saying,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.720]   hey, you were supposed to get rid of this guy, what's up?
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.560]   'Cause that's not exactly what he was upset about.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.520]   His first statement in saying to,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.080]   addressing the church wasn't, he should've been gone.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.560]   Right?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.400]   Essentially, his exhortation to them is,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.280]   how could your heart be so selfish
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.600]   that you didn't care to mourn with this brother?
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.900]   Right?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.800]   Like, he is addressing the issue of the heart.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.200]   How could you be so careless?
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.300]   Yeah?
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.600]   Let's move to the next verses.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.400]   Okay, let's move to the next verses.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.760]   And what I'd like you to do really quickly,
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.260]   oh, you know what, I didn't give you the section heading.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.960]   Well, I actually wanted you guys to do that on your own.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.280]   Okay, so take a moment, summarize verse one and two.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.520]   What is Apostle Paul doing there?
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.840]   And just give it a little title, okay?
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.240]   And then after you're done with that,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.960]   go to verse three and four.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.860]   And what you're gonna do is, this sentence,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.480]   it's like actually one big, long, run-on sentence,
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.600]   is complicated because it has many dependent clauses
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.920]   attached to independent clauses.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.220]   What I'd like you to do is just circle
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.900]   the main independent clauses that you see in English, okay?
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.100]   Just so that you get what's the gist,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.940]   what's the main point.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.860]   And then you're gonna see that when you do that,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.700]   you'll notice how the dependent clauses
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.080]   attach to the main one, okay?
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.580]   How many of you guys don't know the difference
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.340]   between independent and dependent clauses?
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.420]   (laughs)
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.580]   I just started seeing people smirking, like,
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.480]   "Hey, I'm just gonna circle something."
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.560]   (laughs)
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.580]   - That was a PSL.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.660]   (laughs)
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.500]   - Eric, I'll give you a bye on this.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.900]   Someone lean over and help him.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.540]   (laughs)
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.740]   All right, so,
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.580]   it's just exactly what it sounds like.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.860]   Dependent clauses cannot stand on its own,
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.140]   otherwise, grammatically, it'll sound very awkward.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.340]   After going to the mall, period,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.580]   that's a dependent clause.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.700]   It cannot stand on its own.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.740]   An independent clause has both subject and predicate,
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.340]   and it can stand on its own, okay?
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.180]   A dependent--
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.260]   (laughs)
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.220]   It's like, it's, no, it's easy, just do it.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.420]   (laughs)
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.260]   All right.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.500]   (laughs)
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.420]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.340]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.260]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.180]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.100]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.020]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.940]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.860]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.780]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.700]   (clippers buzzing)
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.580]   So again, it's verse three and four together,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.180]   sorry, verse three to five together
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.460]   is actually kinda one section,
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.540]   indicated in your Bibles by, again,
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.380]   the numbers, when they're bolded in your Bibles,
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.020]   show you paragraph markers, okay?
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.860]   So that's one section together,
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.140]   and it is a little complicated
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.300]   because it's like a big run-on sentence
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.680]   with lots of little dependent clauses.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.340]   I'll tell you a funny story while you guys do that.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.660]   So when I started seminary back in 2006,
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.020]   I had a roommate who I believed to be a genius.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.260]   He was one of those guys who could read a book in an hour.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.100]   He's actually a, he has a doctorate in Greek
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.140]   and he's teaching on the East Coast right now.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.380]   But when we started seminary,
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.340]   we had to take a grammar exam
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.820]   because we work with languages so much, right?
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.900]   I was so scared, I was like, oh my God,
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.660]   his name is Sean, I was like, Sean, I'm totally a fob.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.700]   Like, you know, I was born in Korea, my English sucks,
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.780]   like I don't even read a lot, I don't write a lot and stuff,
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.660]   so I was like sweating and I studied so hard.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.700]   He's like, don't worry about it, be easy.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.380]   He failed. (laughs)
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.820]   And I passed.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.660]   And I went, blah!
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.540]   Anyway, it was pretty funny.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.140]   Everybody kinda, you know,
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.140]   grammar's like nobody's best thing, best subject, so.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.380]   Anyway, did you guys get the main clause?
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.380]   What'd you guys get as the main clause?
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.260]   How about somebody from the guys table
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.540]   right in front of me, right here?
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.980]   By the way, we have some--
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.900]   (audience member speaks off mic)
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.940]   - For I have already judged him.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.260]   - Okay, so in verse five, I have, wait, what?
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.100]   Oh, verse three.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.140]   - For I have already judged him.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.620]   - Good, for I have already judged him.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.860]   Good, that's one little segment right there.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.660]   What's the other one?
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.300]   - I have decided to deliver such a way.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.780]   - Great.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.140]   I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan, okay?
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.140]   So, if you were to simplify this,
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.420]   you would kinda put it together by saying,
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.060]   Apostle Paul says to them in the first section,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.380]   this is what you guys are doing.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.980]   You're allowing sin and immorality to exist among you,
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.540]   and you are arrogant, why?
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.380]   'Cause for I, I have already judged him, right?
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.460]   That's essentially what he's saying.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.580]   Now, as he's saying that, though,
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.500]   we have to now ask the question, but what does that mean?
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.420]   There are several interpretive ways
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.580]   that you can go about this, but in your own words,
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.460]   what do you think he means by what he,
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.980]   so the first question I have for you is,
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.180]   what is he saying that he has already done?
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.020]   Okay?
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:28:00.860]   Yes?
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.620]   - I think he has already identified that what that action
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:10.620]   is is sinful, so he cannot follow that church's principles.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.020]   He has already addressed it as that.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.420]   - Great, okay, good.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.260]   So did you guys hear him?
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.140]   He's like, although I'm not there,
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.740]   I have already spiritually assessed
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.220]   what that person has done, right?
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.840]   So he's given a verdict about the whole situation.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.320]   Now, looking at all the little dependent clauses
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.020]   around that, well, how would you summarize
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.300]   all those dependent clauses?
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.180]   What is he saying?
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.180]  , Yes?
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:55.580]   - He's one with them, even though he's not there
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:00.580]   and is acting in the power of Jesus
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:05.260]   for everyone's good.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.820]   - Okay, great.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.620]   He's acting in the power of Jesus for everyone's good.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.060]   Although I'm not there, this is what I'm doing, okay?
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.300]   All right, so as I thought about,
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.460]   what is Apostle Paul saying?
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.980]   What is Apostle Paul saying?
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   He's kind of, you know, when you want to convince somebody
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.140]   they need to do something, you know,
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.340]   you can use a lot of different argumentation
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.140]   as to why they need to do it.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.220]   Apostle Paul is stacking up the reasons
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.940]   why they need to do it, essentially, right?
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.220]   And in so doing, he's saying, you need to do this
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.900]   because this is in the authority of Christ, right?
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.420]   You need to do this because this is
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.460]   in the authority of Christ.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.980]   So as he's talking about this scenario,
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.540]   here's a guy doing some heinous act
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.460]   and they haven't done anything about it yet.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.780]   He's saying, you have to do something about it
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.020]   and you have to do this because it's
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.580]   in the authority of Christ, okay?
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.460]   So he's adding that authority to the exhortation
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.900]   that they need to remove such an individual.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.440]   Now, as we continue thinking about this,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:22.100]   you know, that's, question number two,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.580]   why would he talk about his spirit being with them?
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.500]   That's what I'm saying is,
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.620]   he's talking about his spirit being with them
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.840]   because it adds that element of weight,
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.100]   of authority of Christ, giving both the foundation
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   and the motive behind taking such an action, okay?
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.140]   And you gotta realize that the action is difficult.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.780]   Apostle Paul says that he's delivered such a one
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.780]   to Satan for the destruction of his flesh.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.820]   And as he's saying that, he is far, okay?
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.620]   He is far.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.140]   So, you can think that as he is saying,
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.340]   I am sending one out to Satan
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.020]   for the destruction of his flesh,
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.980]   he is desiring that the church execute that plan and idea.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.180]   Okay?
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.060]   Now, for your, because there's sometimes
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.560]   so many questions about that verse,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.300]   like what does it mean?
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.020]   I wanted to note that there are several meanings
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.540]   that some people have concluded to.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.020]   There are commentators who would say,
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.540]   one, Apostle Paul literally wants to cast him out
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.540]   so that he would die, like literally die.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.940]   Because this isn't so far removed
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.140]   from other scenarios where Apostle Paul said,
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.820]   for example even, even within this book
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.220]   when Apostle Paul starts talking about the communion
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   in chapter 11, you do realize Apostle Paul warns him,
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.380]   saying because people don't take the communion seriously
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.180]   and in a holy manner, they're gonna die, okay?
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.020]   The other thing, they think all he's doing
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.500]   is sending him out into Satan's sphere of influence.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.980]   He's gonna be no longer protected
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.460]   in the boundaries of the church,
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.780]   but he's going to send him out into the, you know,
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.620]   into the arena or kingdom of Satan, so to speak.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.140]   And the other one is to say that
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.780]   Apostle Paul is saying literally
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.540]   he wants that person to physically suffer, why?
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.860]   Because if that person doesn't have the community,
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.100]   he's bound to suffer, okay?
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.380]   Will the other people, the pagans outside,
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.420]   will they receive him well?
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.920]   Somebody who is even rejected by the Christians?
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.580]   Christians weren't so popular back then.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.820]   They were like, oh wow, Christians, you know?
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.380]   And so a lot of people are saying
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.020]   Apostle Paul wants this person to feel physical,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.640]   literal discomfort and suffering, okay?
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   Now, for me, obviously, I don't,
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.620]   from the passage, I don't think that
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.780]   he is talking about literal death here.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.100]   Although, yes, in the Bible, there are cases
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.580]   of literal death, why?
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.780]   Because even in the context in verse 11,
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:06.780]   it doesn't sound like the guy is gonna die, right?
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.320]   But if somebody is cast out, that individual
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.460]   is just simply going to be cut off
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.820]   from the brotherhood of Christ.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.180]   'Cause in verse 11, he says,
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.920]   don't associate with such a one.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.280]   Don't have fellowship with such a one, right?
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.740]   He's not talking about somebody
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.940]   who's going to literally die.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.480]   And so what's more, in this passage,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.820]   in that specific verse, in verse five,
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.740]   he says he's going to deliver such a one
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.780]   to Satan for the destruction of his flesh.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.700]   The NIV passage, the translation,
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.980]   does some of the interpretive work for us
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.860]   and interprets it for the destruction of sinful nature.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.140]   And so in doing that, basically, NIV is taking
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.740]   a position saying we're talking about
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.340]   something spiritual here.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.100]   We're not talking about the Apostle Paul
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.060]   wants that person to physically go hungry
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.020]   because he doesn't have the Christian community.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.180]   He's gonna be lonely, he's gonna be persecuted
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.740]   by the pagans.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.740]   No, he's talking about something spiritual, right?
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.020]   And so I definitely, for me, I take the position
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.300]   to saying Apostle Paul, he is saying
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.580]   what we kind of naturally would think about this passage.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.740]   If Apostle Paul is saying you need to mourn
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.700]   over this man's sin, remove him from your midst,
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.820]   he is doing that call of Christ to say
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.020]   take him out of your community
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.860]   and no longer treat him like a Christian.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.380]   But consider him someone still bound
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.340]   underneath the reign of Satan.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.360]   Okay?
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.580]   Question.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.780]   - What does it mean by that his spirit
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.100]   may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus?
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.020]   Is that Jesus is a creator of the world?
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.940]   - Right.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.140]   So Eugene asked, what does it mean though
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.940]   like that his spirit may be saved in the day?
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.460]   Why does it have this forward-looking aspect to it?
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.300]   I think it's because Apostle Paul,
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.300]   he says what he can say and then he sometimes
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.980]   prevents himself from saying what he cannot say.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.300]   He's gonna send this guy out like a pagan.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.060]   This guy is not a Christian.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.180]   He don't have a spirit within him, right?
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.000]   But there's a sense in which could God,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   could God use this means of excommunication
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.620]   to eventually restore his soul and save him?
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.940]   He could.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.660]   Not only that, but we could ask the question
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.000]   what is the goal of the excommunication here?
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.260]   From that little phrase that Eugene
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.100]   just kind of highlighted now,
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   what do you think would be then
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.780]   the goal of excommunication?
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.340]   - Restoration.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.780]   - Restoration.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.680]   You guys should write that in.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.340]   That there's a sense in which even in the casting out
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.660]   of the pagan, like the sinning individual,
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.540]   this guy who is sinning like heinously
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.260]   against his father and mother and the church,
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.380]   the goal is still redemptive.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.740]   The goal is still redemptive.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.580]   But I wanna read you a passage
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.740]   in 1 Timothy chapter one, verse 19 through 20, okay?
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.900]   1 Timothy chapter one, verse 19 through 20.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   I believe I have it in your packets.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.700]   And this is another passage of Apostle Paul,
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.940]   again a church letter to Timothy.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.900]   He says, "Keeping faith in a good conscience,
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.260]   "which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.980]   "in regard to their faith.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.540]   "Among these are Himenaeus and Alexander,
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.360]   "whom I have handed over to Satan
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.600]   "so that they will be taught not to blaspheme."
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.140]   Okay, they will be taught not to blaspheme.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.540]   "I just finished asking you what is the goal
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.160]   "of excommunication, and we said redemption.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.800]   "From that passage in 1 Timothy,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.940]   "what is the goal of excommunication?"
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:52.060]   Sorry?
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.340]   From the 1 Timothy passage.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.780]   - Yeah, being taught not to blaspheme
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.980]   is there a lesson, hopefully we're learning that lesson.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.100]   - Right, right, right.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.100]   So, in looking at both, absolutely.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.820]   There's a side of redemption, restoration.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.740]   But one of the things I want us to write down is both.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.420]   One is redemptive, but excommunication has to have
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.140]   its effect of the destruction of that sinful habit.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.580]   Okay?
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.180]   Excommunication has to have its effect
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.860]   of stopping the sin that's existent
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.060]   in the life of the individual in the church.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.940]   Okay?
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.940]   And so to the degree, I wanna read to you guys
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.700]   some passages in the Old Testament,
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.860]   because in this section, it has an Old Testament flavor.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.900]   Later on, Apostle Paul is actually going to quote
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.540]   a passage from the Old Testament.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.220]   But I wanna read to you a passage in Numbers chapter 15.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.860]   You don't have to turn there just for the sake of time.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.780]   I'm just gonna read it for us.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.460]   It says, "While the Israelites were in the desert,
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.580]   "a man was found gathering on the Sabbath day."
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.900]   Now, God has given commands not to work on the Sabbath day,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.220]   'cause the Sabbath day is to be meant holy.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.580]   In verse 33, it says, "Those who found him gathering wood
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.100]   "brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly."
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.780]   So this guy gathers wood, and then he gets caught,
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.900]   and he gets brought before the whole congregation,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.780]   the leaders and the whole assembly.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.220]   "And they kept him in custody,
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.440]   "because it was not clear what should be done.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.460]   "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'The man must die.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.180]   "'The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.'
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.680]   "So the assembly took him outside the camp,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.600]   "and the assembly stoned him to death
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.640]   "as the Lord commanded Moses."
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.820]   That's one of these crazy stories in the Bible
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.500]   where if you don't understand what's happening,
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.160]   it's like, what the, the guy was carrying wood.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.860]   Not only that, but if the whole assembly gathered together,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.740]   you're talking about not just like 10 people,
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.740]   but this one guy, he must have then had what?
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.700]   The whole tribes of Israel come together
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.220]   and stoned the man outside.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:17.140]   Now, I tell you the story because back then,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.060]   we know that sin was taken seriously.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.500]   And when sin was taken seriously,
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.700]   God made sure that the whole congregation knew it was serious
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.460]   by making sure that not only just the leaders,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.100]   but the whole assembly was involved in the execution.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.980]   Okay?
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   There are more passages,
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.940]   just jot these down for your reference for later.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.380]   Numbers 35, verse 24 and on.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.260]   Basically, there's a case of homicide, but it's accidental.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.100]   And then Moses essentially instructs the people.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.540]   Again, there is this community aspect
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.500]   where the assembly has to get together
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.540]   and carry out the punishment.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.780]   In Leviticus chapter 24, verse 13 through 16,
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.300]   another case where the assembly is gathered together
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.140]   and the assembly executes a man
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.840]   for blasphemy against the Lord.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.740]   Why do I talk about this?
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.740]   It's because we realize one of the implied aspects
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.340]   of biblical truth that we see here
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.360]   is that there is a community that needs to be kept in mind
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.200]   in the whole process of discipline and purity, right?
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.340]   That this is not the act of Apostle Paul.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.980]   This isn't the expectation of just the leaders.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.300]   But Apostle Paul says, "When you gather together," okay?
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.980]   Apostle Paul tells them that when they gather together,
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.620]   this is when they are to carry this out.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:48.420]   And so that needs to be kept in mind, okay?
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.580]   Now, in consideration of the community,
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.340]   we talk about the next section.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.660]   Let's read verse six through eight.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.980]   He says, "Your boasting is not good.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.660]   "Do you not know that a little leaven
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.820]   "leavens the whole lump of dough?
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:06.160]   "Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.040]   "just as you are, in fact, unleavened.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.000]   "For Christ, our Passover, also has been sacrificed.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.540]   "Therefore, let us celebrate the feast,
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.320]   "not with old leaven, nor with the leaven
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.300]   "of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.500]   "of sincerity and truth."
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.680]   Okay, sincerity and truth.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.540]   So we're on section three, and I ask you this question.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.020]   Apostle Paul gives one of these, you know,
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.620]   metaphorical, parable-like universal principles.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.780]   "When there is some leaven, it leavens the whole dough."
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.020]   Okay, what's the principle, like spiritual principle,
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.580]   that we're supposed to draw from that?
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.340]   And it's a pretty obvious one, but just,
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.940]   let's verbalize it and summarize it in our own way.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.700]   (pages rustling)
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:42:15.060]   Anyone?
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.380]   From verses six through eight, what I just read,
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.340]   he gives one of these, like, well-known Old Testament
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.740]   and New Testament teachings, Jesus Christ used it too.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.300]   Basically, you know, "When there's leaven,
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.360]   "it leavens the whole lump, don't you know it?"
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.420]   So what's the spiritual principle for the church
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.420]   that they're supposed to understand there?
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:41.140]   - A little bit of evil, rough, simple.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.740]   - Good.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.740]   That, earlier we mentioned how it's arrogant
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.680]   to think like, "Eh, it's a little bit,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.720]   "it's not gonna really affect me."
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.820]   That's arrogant, right?
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.040]   To be wise was to realize a little bit of leaven
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.000]   affects the whole lump, right?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.460]   To be biblical, to be God-fearing, to be humble
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.540]   would be to realize this principle that sin,
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.140]   there's a sense in which in no way is it ever small.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:17.580]   That sin, by nature of what it is, in no way is it ever,
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.280]   just a little bit, okay?
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.700]   That's the kind of principle they're supposed to learn.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.540]   And we're supposed to learn that this, the leaven,
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.500]   and do you guys know what leaven is?
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.220]   Or the yeast and all that stuff?
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.780]   I didn't know what that is, so I looked it up on Google.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:40.180]   It's actually a fungus, okay?
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.280]   And just like, you know, lately, like, yogurt's really big,
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.460]   and the culture and bacteria,
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.420]   and how it mixes the thing and all that kind of stuff.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:55.540]   Likewise, yeast is just fungus used to ferment the dough.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.700]   And in so doing, it causes the dough to rise.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.140]   The yeast is also used in a lot of different scenarios
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:04.020]   where the yeast is used for, let's say, brewing alcohol,
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:08.900]   alcoholic drinks and stuff, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.020]   But the whole picture you're supposed to get is,
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.460]   like, when you have that, let's say, dough,
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.420]   or when you have, like, the brew,
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.020]   the yeast doesn't just, like, stay in its little culture,
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.540]   and then it just kind of floats around in there.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.740]   It affects the whole thing, right?
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.340]   It permeates.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.860]   And so the whole picture you're supposed to get is,
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.580]   there's a sense in which we're supposed to look
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.500]   at the church as a collective whole.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.060]   And sin within the church is not just sin
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.940]   in one individual.
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.060]   It permeates.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:42.460]   That's the kind of lesson we're supposed to learn, right?
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:46.380]   And so there's a sense in which, many times in the Bible,
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.340]   the implications of that are taught.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:54.060]   So if there is sin in you, then there is sin in y'all.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.140]   And if one individual is culpable, y'all are culpable.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.620]   And so many times in the Bible, failure to deal with sin
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.580]   in an individual's life meant the incurring
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.740]   of God's displeasure upon the whole community.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.300]   And I talk about this a lot in BCC.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.100]   And the story, to me, is always profound and kind of crazy,
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.700]   is Joshua chapter seven.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.620]   In Joshua chapter seven, it tells of the story
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.220]   of the sin of Achan.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.020]   There was a ban, okay?
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.060]   Joshua, you know, you imagine him as the conquering guy
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.140]   after Moses, he's entering into the land of Canaan,
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.060]   defeating all these enemies and foes.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.540]   But then God makes a clear command,
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.860]   "I don't want you taking any of the spoil,
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   the plundering of the pagans, and taking all their riches.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.300]   'Cause you have to realize that God is the one
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.140]   enriching you, not the pagans, right?
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.980]   And in so doing, God says, "There's a ban.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.140]   "I don't want you touching any of that,
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.860]   "because I want you both to understand
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.820]   "that I'm the one blessing you,
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.000]   "and secondly, I want you to be pure,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.100]   "because much of the whole pagan land's wealth
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.580]   "is all idolatrous."
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.400]   But what happens?
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.260]   I mean, dang, these little idols, they're nothing.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.740]   But they're made of gold.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.300]   They're made of precious jewels.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.380]   They're beautiful, they're handcrafted,
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.780]   they're rare, they're precious.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.660]   So Achan takes something.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.460]   But what's crazy about the whole scene is,
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.700]   God in the morning says, "Moses, bring out everybody."
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.940]   So everybody, not just one tribe,
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.220]   but like every tribe has to get together.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.260]   And then God says, "Moses, bring out that one tribe."
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.060]   And so that one tribe comes out.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.440]   And then in front of everybody, God says,
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.540]   "Bring out that one family."
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.580]   And the whole family comes out.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.940]   And the next thing you know, you think,
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.640]   and bring out Achan, but he ends up
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.900]   judging the whole thing.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.220]   And then you kind of realize, like, dude.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.940]   And then his immediate family, they get judged to death.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.300]   And you're just like, dude.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.260]   And you just realize, God is not seeing us
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.180]   as like distinct individuals, so to speak.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.780]   Although God loves us individually,
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   and he knows us individually, he cares for us individually,
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.140]   he knows everything about us,
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.860]   everything that's unique about us, right?
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   But you just realize that God sees us
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.980]   as a heavenly father, as a family.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.400]   As a community.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.840]   And we, I think, in our individualistic American culture,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.760]   need to just scrap that
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.020]   and adopt the way the Bible views us.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:24.560]   So, the failure to deal with serious sin in our members
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.960]   is a major failure to deal with sin
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.640]   in our collective whole, okay?
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.000]   Just think about that for a moment,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.220]   that so far, just in the first couple chapters
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:42.140]   of 1 Corinthians, we had the analogy of the body,
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.340]   the building and the temple,
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.140]   now we have the analogy of the dough,
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.380]   and the lump of dough, you know, the bread.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.620]   And all that is like kind of Apostle Paul teaching,
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.620]   like, you guys are one.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.820]   And this is your identity, you know what I mean?
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.900]   And so again, he's giving a perspective,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.260]   he's giving the right perspective
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.580]   on how we're supposed to think about sin in our membership.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:09.260]   Now, you guys can give another section title to this one.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:14.160]   If you want the first couple ones,
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.560]   I just, you know, wanted to show you
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.440]   that there's a flow of Apostle Paul's reasoning and thought.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.080]   And in the beginning, I just labeled that
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.240]   as identifying their errors, okay?
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:31.380]   And then in the second, I just said this was,
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.580]   what did I title it as?
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.360]   My notes.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:43.680]   Oh, I put Paul's authoritative support, okay?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.640]   And number three, I labeled this as,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.840]   why do you need to do this, okay?
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.600]   Why do you need to do this?
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.240]   Why do we need to take the hard road
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.840]   of like excommunicating somebody?
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.560]   That's so harsh, it's so difficult.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.820]   Just correcting somebody is hard, you know?
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.060]   Sometimes, you know, when you talk to people
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.580]   in a casual setting and sometimes
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.300]   they like kind of mispronounce your name
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.900]   or they kind of forget which school you went to,
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.740]   sometimes you're kind of like,
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.980]   eh, is it worth correcting them?
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.300]   And you're just kind of, eh, whatever, you know?
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.900]   Correcting somebody even in a casual setting is hard.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.660]   Going through the process of excommunicating somebody,
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.900]   why do that?
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.820]   'Cause he's teaching us.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.540]   A little bit of yeast, a little bit of leaven,
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.140]   leavens the entire dough.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.740]   Ruins the whole batch, right?
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.800]   I want us to think about what he's saying
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.520]   and specifically also think about
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.680]   the seriousness of sexual immorality.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:45.800]   If you notice, in the next couple passages,
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.240]   let's take a look at section four,
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.300]   or the next section, in verses nine through 13.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.280]   It says here, I wrote you in my letter
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.240]   not to associate with immoral people.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.680]   I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.860]   or of the covetous and swindlers and idolaters,
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:06.380]   for then you would have to go out of the world.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.340]   But actually I wrote to you not to associate
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:13.920]   with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.720]   or covetous, idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler,
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.520]   not even to eat with such a one, okay?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.340]   I'm gonna read the next verses a little bit in a moment,
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.040]   but I want us to take a moment in this occasion
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.040]   as we're talking about sexual immorality
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.300]   to think about sexual immorality.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:36.000]   Apostle Paul, in his perspective about sexual immorality,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   in this portion, he is classifying sexual immorality
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.640]   as just as wicked and vile as the idolaters,
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.040]   revilers, drunkards, and swindlers, isn't he?
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.000]   Not only that, take a look at verse eight.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.040]   In verse eight he says,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.560]   therefore let us celebrate this feast not with old leaven,
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.240]   nor with the leaven of malice, wickedness,
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.240]   but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.920]   So how would Apostle Paul, in challenging this specific sin,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.360]   see the sin of sexual immorality?
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.400]   He would think it as same as malice and wickedness.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.940]   He would see it as same as insincerity and falsehood.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.680]   You see my point?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.200]   Now the reason why I wanna talk about this a little bit
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   is because we have definitely become a culture
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.380]   that has desensitized sexual sin,
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.900]   diminished the weight of sexual sin.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:39.200]   Now, the specific case that we're looking at
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.220]   in this chapter is incest.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:48.120]   But, but, although as kind of like vile
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.600]   and disgusting that is in our eyes,
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.360]   sexual immorality is sexual immorality.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.880]   And in an age and culture where sexual,
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.920]   like physical intimacy has been so romanticized,
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.880]   I definitely think that in the way that Christians
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.900]   and young people think about sexual immorality,
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.560]   it hasn't equated to biblical standards.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.880]   What do I mean by that?
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.380]   'Cause I feel like even for me when I was younger,
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.200]   there's a sense in which
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.600]   if you crossed boundaries with a girl,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.800]   you would call it that.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.000]   I crossed boundaries with a girl, I'm sorry.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.340]   If you lusted, you would call it
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.240]   just kind of like I lacked self-control.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.220]   If you had a girlfriend or a boyfriend
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.780]   and you were involved in sexually immoral behavior,
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.280]   you might think that as like,
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.000]   oh, that was just being romantic with each other.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.900]   You might think that as just being intimate with each other.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.640]   You might think that as just building up
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.440]   your companionship with each other.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.880]   But what I'm saying is,
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.560]   that's not the way Apostle Paul would see it.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.640]   You know what I'm getting at?
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.480]   One of the things that Apostle Paul is doing
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.740]   in this section is he is trying to address them
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.840]   and having them think differently about what's happening.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.040]   First, think differently about their own attitudes
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.920]   towards the person, but think differently
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.440]   about the sin itself as well, right?
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.360]   Apostle Paul's like, I want you to worship
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.600]   with sincerity and in truth.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.900]   The existence of a sin is complete contrary to that.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:28.280]   So, for us, the question is, are we seeing sin
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.780]   with the same kind of weight and same perspective
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.720]   that we need to be?
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.640]   Do we see sin as truly destructive to me and my church?
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.520]   Or do I see sin as like, yeah,
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.180]   but amongst dating people this happens,
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.960]   or amongst guys this happens, amongst girls this happens,
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.820]   amongst X, Y, and Z, this just happens.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.240]   Right?
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.680]   We have to challenge our perspective on the sin.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   It's not just romance.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.440]   It's not just, oh, I felt strongly,
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.200]   all this kind of stuff is not right.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.960]   And I wish that I would, you know,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.320]   as a, for me, when I was younger and stuff like that,
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.700]   I wish I had this kind of conviction,
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.560]   even at an early age.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.840]   I feel like this is the kind of stuff
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.040]   that we should teach and convict people at an early age
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   to accurately portray sin the way it ought to be.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.080]   Right?
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.520]   'Cause our minds are always playing tricks
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.080]   to diminish it.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.200]   Okay.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.300]   So, in thinking about that, we have that said.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.180]   Now, in verse nine through 13,
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.280]   in verse 12, he says this question.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.480]   For what have I to do with judging outsiders?
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.640]   Do you not judge those who are within the church?
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.600]   And I remember asking you this question
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   as part of your homework and your discussion
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.880]   at the beginning.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.520]   Are we to treat and judge outsiders differently
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.720]   or equally as insiders?
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.280]   And why would you say what you say?
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.920]   What did you guys discuss and say?
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.680]   (water dripping)
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:19.120]   What did you guys discuss?
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:19.960]   Let's see.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.320]   I'm calling on girls' table.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:27.440]   How about Mel, Christine, Carrie, or Jessica?
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.600]   What did you guys discuss about,
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.840]   are we supposed to judge and deal differently
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.440]   with outsiders versus insiders?
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:42.040]   - I would say yes, to the answer.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.160]   - Okay, why?
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.040]   - He said, within the church,
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.640]   it's, there's an accountability there.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.480]   And especially within the world of church,
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.320]   if you're signing on to the church,
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.360]   you have to ask for accountability in that sense.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.960]   It's more of a, it's more of a discipline.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.280]   And the work that's been done within the church
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.720]   or outside of the church, ultimately,
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.400]   there's a sense of they don't really know
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.920]   what the standard is.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.440]   So the level of the standard is different
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.280]   outside of the church.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   And ultimately, both groups are accountable to that,
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.640]   but especially the non-believers,
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   because in a sense, they don't know what is the standard.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.080]   So, like the way that,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.160]   I just don't know what judgment,
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.000]   in regards to factors, should look completely different.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.400]   - Right, okay, good.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.960]   So she says yes, should look completely different.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.720]   Different accountability, different standards,
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.600]   different resources, everything, right?
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.800]   Yes?
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.480]   - This is a question I've been meaning to ask,
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.680]   it's a follow up from what you just said.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.520]   - Okay.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.960]   - This whole Supreme Court ruling
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.920]   that make this applicable.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.760]   - Yeah.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.680]   - The whole Supreme Court ruling
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.720]   that seems to discourage,
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.000]   should Christians, should us Christians be,
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.080]   how should we respond?
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.400]   According to this past story.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.160]   - Christians don't know the standard.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.000]   - Yeah.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.520]   So he just kind of asked,
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.080]   how should we respond to recent political news?
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:24.320]   It was a huge kind of momentous decision.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.720]   How should we respond?
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.720]   Obviously I can't give a thorough answer to that,
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.360]   but I think definitely,
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.560]   both parts.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:40.080]   One, I think we all should care a lot.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.320]   And actually we should all voice our opinions a lot.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.200]   Why?
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.120]   Because you live here.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.000]   Because you have the privilege.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.640]   So exercise your privilege.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.160]   Thank God we don't live in a country
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.800]   where the government says, be quiet,
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.000]   we're gonna do what we do, you can't say anything.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.760]   But we live in a country where actually the opinion,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.160]   vote, and the perspective of the people matter a lot.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.720]   One person asked me,
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.200]   oh no, but there's separation of church and state,
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.160]   and you can never cross boundaries and stuff.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.360]   And it's like, that's foolish.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.960]   Because to tell you honestly,
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.880]   the vast majority of the laws
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.040]   are laws that are simply, in my mind,
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.160]   dependent upon what's enforceable.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.440]   Every law is moral, every law is ethical,
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.360]   and one of the major factors as to why it exists
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.840]   or doesn't exist is the question of,
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.160]   is it enforceable or not?
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:37.880]   So in either case, so that's one side.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.720]   But the other side is, the Bible taught us
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.820]   we don't wage war against flesh and blood.
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.920]   Our battle is spiritual.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:51.920]   Our battle is truly a battle of eternal trajectory.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.520]   There's a battle for the glory of the Lord.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.800]   And so we have to keep those two things in balance.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.200]   Where I don't think that,
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.040]   do I think that you should give up your careers
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.080]   and go fight this battle
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.520]   just on the grounds of homosexuality?
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.720]   No, I think you're wasting your life.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.220]   Because again, our battle is spiritual.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.880]   That's a brief summary, I think, of what I would say.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   But obviously there's so much more to be said about it.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.160]   But in line with that,
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.600]   actually what does matter is I've been reading
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:30.120]   a lot of articles about that subject to Christians.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.920]   Where some people have written articles and said,
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:33.760]   hey Christians,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   the world's gonna do what it's gonna do,
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.520]   but how come you're celebrating this?
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.200]   Right?
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.080]   I think that's a legitimate question.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.720]   A letter addressing the Christians,
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.240]   like how come you don't have an opinion?
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.480]   How come you haven't thought about it?
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.620]   How come you don't care about it?
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.360]   Or how come you are on their side?
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360]   Right?
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.800]   'Cause that's kind of the gist
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.080]   of what this passage is saying, huh?
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.480]   It's like, now,
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.640]   Apostle Paul obviously has taught this church before
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.600]   and said, you need to be pure.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.920]   Your church needs to be holy, you know?
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.360]   And he has said, don't associate with these pagan people
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.800]   who drink all the time, who celebrate in pagan ways,
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.560]   who swindle people, who are covetous
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.240]   and are adoratrous and all that kind of stuff.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.680]   And then he says, let me clarify your responsibility.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.360]   So that's the way I titled section four.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.340]   Let me clarify your responsibility, okay?
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:37.960]   He says, you're responsible for your church.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.620]   You're responsible for your brothers and sisters, right?
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:46.280]   So there's a sense in which I ask you this question
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.320]   in the section four, like,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.200]   what does he mean by I don't associate
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.000]   and what's the overall command here?
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.240]   How would you summarize his overall command?
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:12.800]   How about,
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.640]   I'm gonna call on
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.920]   Hannah Michelle.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.580]   (Hannah laughs)
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:32.960]   Okay, don't associate with the so-called brother
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.280]   who is an immoral person.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.640]   Think about that for a moment, okay?
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.960]   This is truly a challenge.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.080]   You know, I'm gonna admit to you guys,
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.160]   I am not a confrontational person.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.200]   I always lean on the side of being patient with people,
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.520]   giving them time to come around,
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.740]   understanding their situation, and that's all necessary.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.360]   But Apostle Paul is so concerned
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.380]   with the righteousness and holiness of the church.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.200]   He says, if there's an individual
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.440]   who calls on the name of the Lord
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.800]   and considers themselves Christian,
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.280]   then what is he saying?
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.720]   You need to go to the extent of not associating with them.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.760]   Like, whoa, is that not a kind of like a wake-up call for us?
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.160]   For me, it is.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.000]   He says, if a brother, so-called brother,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.040]   is sexually immoral, greedy, idolatrous,
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.920]   slanderous, drunkard, or swindler,
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.760]   he says, don't associate with that person.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.720]   And you guys understand what don't associate
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.680]   with that person means.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.720]   It's like, don't have regular fellowship,
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.280]   don't just shoot the breeze with that person,
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.520]   don't have social just like, oh, let's have fun together,
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.880]   that kind of stuff, right?
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.200]   But at the tail end of it,
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.640]   he would even give an extent over in verse 11.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.120]   Don't even eat with such a one.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.980]   Don't even sit down and do what is so common,
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.700]   you do three times a day, eat, right?
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.400]   And so, this is the part where I do wanna talk
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.880]   a little bit about church discipline,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.480]   because this is actually one of the longest segments
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.160]   in the Bible about church discipline.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.400]   Casting someone out, removing them from your fellowship,
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.000]   okay, this is a passage that has so many implications
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.800]   about how we practice church.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.680]   In order for us to say, hey, leave us,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.880]   there has to be a us, and that's part of the reason
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.800]   why we practice membership, right?
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.840]   And the way we practice membership,
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.760]   we have committed here at Berean
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.200]   that we will do everything that the Lord commands
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.360]   to the extent that we will cast out somebody
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.940]   and go all the way to the point of excommunication, right?
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:51.760]   Well, in this, he says, what that looks like is,
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.360]   if you come to a point where you have
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.800]   to excommunicate somebody, don't even eat with such a one.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.640]   There was a time in our church history
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.720]   where we had to go through this entire process,
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.680]   for those of you who are new at our church,
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.600]   we have done this process at our church, you know?
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.160]   And we had to encourage the church to be strong in this,
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.640]   to have the right perspective in this,
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.360]   to have a redemptive, corrective,
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.400]   transformative agenda with this.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.480]   But we also had to challenge people,
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.400]   but don't take this lightly either.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.640]   Don't be like, oh, yeah, the church excommunicated you,
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.560]   but do you wanna watch a movie on Thursday?
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.320]   You can't do that.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.160]   Why?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.840]   Let me read you a passage here in 2 Thessalonians,
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.800]   chapter three, verse 15.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.960]   We hear that some among you are idle.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.800]   There are people who are not working,
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.400]   who are just bumming it.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.200]   They are not busy, they are busybodies.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.800]   Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.680]   to settle down and earn the bread they eat.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.740]   And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.920]   If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter,
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.580]   take special note of him.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:03.040]   Do not associate with him in order that he may feel ashamed.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.780]   Okay, so he says here,
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.480]   do this practice of not associating with that individual
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.200]   so that he might feel ashamed.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.160]   He has to feel things are not right.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.080]   He has to recognize I am not right with God
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.280]   and I'm not right with God's people.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.680]   Does that make sense?
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.200]   But if a church says, hey, church, congregation,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.000]   membership, we're gonna get together,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.960]   we've prayed about this, we've talked to the individual,
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.440]   we've gone through the process,
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.440]   we're excommunicating this individual,
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.680]   and members of the church are like,
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.080]   yeah, that's what the leaders are saying,
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.760]   but he's my friend and I'm gonna go hang out with him.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.620]   We're gonna go play golf.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.880]   We're gonna go bowling.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.480]   You can't do that because what you're saying is
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.020]   the spiritual reality that does not matter.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.920]   That's what you're saying.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.720]   So again, I don't wanna belabor this point
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.820]   because we're not in the process right now,
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.120]   but the whole idea is,
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.840]   in thinking about the weight of sin
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.480]   and all that we've, oh, I just realized
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.560]   I've gone really long, all right.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.400]   In thinking about this whole idea,
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.720]   you just realize the weight behind it, right?
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.000]   To call every single member in the church
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.860]   to adhere to this, to call every single member
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.880]   in this church to be careful in how you interact
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.440]   with that person, you just realize the weight of sin, right?
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.320]   The other passage that we have to read
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.800]   because it's so important to us is this in Matthew 18.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.440]   If your brother sins against you,
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.520]   go and show him his fault just between the two of you.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.740]   And so there is that principle.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.320]   You always wanna keep it as small as possible.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.160]   Why?
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.980]   Because if the person repents, you've won him over.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.280]   You don't need to go tell everybody.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.680]   You don't need to go overly shame the guy
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.160]   when he's repentant.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.020]   So keep it in the smallest possible, just the two of you.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.080]   If he listens, you have won your brother.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:04.360]   But if he will not listen, take one or two others along
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.280]   so that every matter may be established
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.560]   by testimony of two or three witnesses.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.600]   If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.560]   And if he refuses to listen to each,
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.520]   even to the church, treat him as you would
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.640]   a pagan or a tax collector.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.880]   will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.340]   will be loosed in heaven.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.720]   Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.960]   agree about anything you ask for,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.560]   it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.400]   For where two or three come together in my name,
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.080]   there am I with them.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.360]   Okay?
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.360]   So, in this passage, we just think about,
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.920]   in talking about like, what needs to take place
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.840]   in the church, I wanna say something to you guys
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.320]   as an important application.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:57.320]   Sin is just as bad now as it was in the days of Moses.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.200]   Think about that, okay?
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.720]   I read to you guys passages where someone sinned,
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.600]   and because of their sin, they were stoned
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.520]   outside the camp by people's, essentially, hands.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:16.440]   People picked up stones and they actually partook
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.640]   in the judgment of that sin.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.520]   The execution of the punishment for that sin.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.880]   But you realize, just because we're in the New Testament,
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.700]   it has not diminished the severity of sin.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.620]   Because, literally, Apostle Paul is quoting
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.300]   Old Testament scripture and saying,
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.440]   remove the wicked man from yourselves.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.520]   And so, if you go with me in your Bibles
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.960]   to, let's say, Deuteronomy chapter,
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.880]   just let's do a quick run through
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.860]   of some of these passages.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.500]   I'm gonna wrap up here with this.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.660]   If you look at Deuteronomy 17, verse seven,
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.800]   he talks about this.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.720]   Verse six, actually, he says, well, I'll start from
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.340]   those first five.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:03.080]   "Then you shall bring out that man or that woman
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.200]   "who has done this evil deed to your gates,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.700]   "that is, the man or the woman,
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.100]   "and you shall stone them to death.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.540]   "On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses,
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.560]   "he who is to die shall be put to death.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.520]   "He shall not be put to death on the evidence
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.620]   "of one witness.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.860]   "The hand of the witness shall be first against him
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:22.100]   "to put him to death, and afterward, the hand of who?
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.020]   "All the people.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.060]   "So you shall," what?
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.860]   "Purge the evil from your midst."
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   That's repeated in the next verses.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.460]   I'm gonna, let's go over to chapter 21, verse 21.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:42.280]   And it says here, I'm gonna start reading from verse 20.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.000]   "They shall say to the elders of the city,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.840]   "this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.820]   "He will not obey us.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.540]   "He is a glutton and a drunkard.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.200]   "Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death,
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.760]   "so that you shall remove the evil from your midst,
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.920]   "and all Israel will hear it and fear."
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.100]   And fear, okay?
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:08.240]   There is a sense in which, at our church,
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.980]   in any Christian church, we shouldn't create
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.060]   an environment where people are afraid
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:18.220]   to be open and vulnerable, to be real and honest, right?
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:21.900]   But also, we shouldn't create an environment
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.200]   where people are not afraid to sin.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.940]   Right?
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.860]   We should not create an environment when people,
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.300]   if they sin, they're too afraid to come out with it
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.400]   because you're just gonna destroy them
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   and plaster them on the wall with rebuke and embarrassment.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.420]   But neither should you create a community
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.420]   where it's so lax, they're not afraid to sin anymore.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:50.340]   And so anybody who comes into our church,
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.500]   if they are dedicated to their sin,
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.800]   they should not feel okay being at our church.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.280]   We should care so much about their well-being
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.320]   that they should realize it's just not okay.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.400]   I don't feel comfortable with these people
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.040]   if they're committed to their sin.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.480]   But if they're committed to change,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.080]   if they're committed to transform,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.240]   if they're committed to be sanctified,
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.240]   then they should feel absolutely,
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.760]   like perfectly fitting into this community.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.500]   Does that make sense?
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.120]   So today we're thinking about this topic,
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.800]   Apostle Paul is addressing a scenario
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.200]   where there was sin in the church
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.020]   and the sin was heinous and he was upset.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.160]   But he was also livid about the way
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.840]   that people were so insensitive,
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.200]   they did nothing about it.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.800]   It's a challenge for us that we care enough
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.300]   about the standard of God and God's holiness
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.760]   that regardless of the way we make people feel,
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.800]   God's standard might be upheld.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.460]   What's more, we should love the brother so much,
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.440]   we should mourn with him in his sin.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.620]   This is our sin, this is our pain.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.520]   Any questions about this passage
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.640]   or the process of discipline and stuff?
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.480]   Yes.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.840]   - I have one.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.240]   So when you pick a church discipline,
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.080]   it's clear what happens with somebody who's a member.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.400]   What happens hypothetically with somebody
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.600]   who is involved in the church
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.120]   but doesn't go through the membership process yet
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.800]   and then they leave because somebody
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.880]   confronts them about a sin?
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.720]   - Yeah.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.680]   - So in your perspective, is that still
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.500]   more or less the same situation
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.000]   in terms of like there's such a person
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.240]   who do not even eat?
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.080]   - Right.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.920]   - So he professes to be a Christian,
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.040]   they just didn't go through the membership process.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:34.880]   - Yeah.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.960]   So two parts.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.320]   One, because if that person is coming into the church
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.040]   as a visitor or someone who's a regular attender
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.980]   and says that they're a Christian,
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.040]   there's still our responsibility.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.980]   So we should still go and address the individual.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.280]   And maybe even go to the extent of saying,
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.600]   I don't know if you are a Christian,
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.320]   and help that person think through it.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.520]   And let's say they just bounce to another church.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.080]   Our elders have talked about this and said,
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.960]   you know it's our responsibility to contact that church
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.940]   if we find out.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:11.680]   And so we have to tread carefully
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.040]   because when you talk about people and stuff like that,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.100]   it's always kind of touchy, you know?
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.460]   So we're trying our best to again,
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.500]   to keep that principle of people who kind of need to know
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   and should know and care enough to know.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.260]   And then, but typically then it's the leaders
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.180]   of the next church that they've gone to.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.020]   And continue just to follow up on that person
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.560]   if at all possible.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.860]   So, but obviously we can't like practice
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.540]   that kind of excommunication.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.860]   If the sin itself happened to be so detrimental
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.660]   that we felt like, so case by case,
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.100]   we felt like we had to address that to the church,
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.500]   then we would, yeah.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.580]   So, yeah.
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.380]   Other questions or?
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.220]   - I have a quick question. - Yeah.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.500]   - You know how like there's a whole positive church
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.780]   discipline for someone who like after meeting up with them,
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.820]   like they still don't turn away from the person
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.660]   that you're still living with,
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.220]   but they don't see a problem in it.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.260]   And you're saying to like not even associate, right?
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.100]   - Yeah.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.060]   - Through like not hanging out with them at all.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:13.260]   And the purpose of that is so that they can,
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.180]   they'll be ashamed and so that ultimately
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.980]   maybe that will be restored, right?
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.500]   But, so are you, I guess in that situation,
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.100]   are you saying like to kind of just leave them alone
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.220]   so they kind of deal with it themselves,
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.700]   that you're not allowed to like support them
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.220]   or give them like, I don't know,
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.020]   just like pray for them or?
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:33.980]   - Oh, okay.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.980]   So his question is like, so let's say he's gone
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.100]   through the whole process of church discipline.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.700]   What does that leave him alone look like?
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.660]   Does that mean just like literally just leave him alone
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.100]   and hope that he comes around?
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:51.340]   So the whole idea of that individual being excommunicated
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:54.580]   is that he cannot partake in the life
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.020]   of the church anymore.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.500]   So that person can't just come into service.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.800]   That person can't just come into Bible study.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.340]   And when we have church fellowship and stuff like that,
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.820]   that person is not just, hey, come on in,
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.620]   we're gonna have dinner together, right?
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:11.980]   So what's kind of expected of the church members
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.300]   is that if they have contact with that person,
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.720]   since the goal is redemptive,
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.540]   that the church member then continues to try to instruct
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.900]   and win that person over.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.900]   I'm pleading with you, man, just humble yourself and repent.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.820]   Like, I don't know why you're being so defensive, you know?
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.980]   And just talk with the individual, plead with them.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:35.220]   Like, I'm not sure if you feel it,
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.420]   but you're hardening yourself and, you know,
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:40.500]   look at all the consequences and stuff like that, you know?
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.220]   So, yeah.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.060]   Yes.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.260]   Sure.
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:06.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:06.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:21.900]   All right, okay.
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.460]   All righty, then I hope you guys
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.940]   have a good discussion time.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.620]   I just try to think of some questions here about,
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.760]   you know, was there anything that was convicting and stuff?
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.780]   Just to kind of explain one of the questions,
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.980]   I kind of phrased funny.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.580]   It's the, when do you warn a brother
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.140]   or reason with him as a parent
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:43.300]   or treat as a pagan or tax collector?
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.540]   So, what's really interesting, obviously, is like,
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:54.960]   like, yes, it does matter at what process
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.960]   of church discipline you're at,
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.060]   but also the Bible kind of teaches us,
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.040]   it's like in different scenarios and circumstances,
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.420]   you just like talk to people differently.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.460]   So, how do we exercise wisdom to say,
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.900]   hey, in what context do I become harsh,
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.940]   not harsh, but like strong, and say,
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.300]   hey, I'm treating you like,
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.860]   I'm talking to you like you're an unbeliever,
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.560]   like we're not on the same page,
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.780]   or at what times do we warn them as a brother
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.260]   and stuff like that, okay?
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.020]   So, that's what I mean, it's just like,
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.460]   there's different scenarios that we function
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.000]   or try to win them over differently, okay?
