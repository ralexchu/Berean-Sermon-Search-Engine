[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [silence]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Hebrews 10, verse 32-39.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Again, this is a continuation of the text that we were looking at last week
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   about the warning of judgment that's coming.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   But again, the conclusion of that, verse 32-39, is going to be a two-part message.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   The first part today is going to be focused on verse 32-34,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and then next week it will be 35-39.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   "But remember the former days when after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of suffering,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   For yet in a very little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   But my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   but of those who have faith to persevering of the soul." Let's pray.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Gracious God, we pray that you would anoint this time, allow your word to go forth,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and affect our hearts, our lives, our thoughts, that it may overflow in all that we do.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We pray for your blessing over this time. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   As you guys know, this week, especially in the United States, but all over the world,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   there was a remembrance of what happened in 9/11.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So some of you guys probably saw that online or at work or wherever it was.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And it's the 19th anniversary of what took place.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Some of you guys who've been to New York may have seen the monuments, you know,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and the thing that you see all over is that we will never forget, right?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And I think the reason why, when there's these specific things that happen in history,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   where whether it is by creating a holiday or monuments or just taking time to remember these things,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   is because by remembering, there are certain things that we want to make sure that
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   whatever it is that we're thinking or doing now, that we wouldn't forget about it going forward.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So obviously when we think about 9/11, one of the first things that we think about are the people who lost their lives.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You know, over 3,000 people were killed that day, and out of the 3,000,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   343 of them were firefighters who ran into the building to save lives,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and 71 of them were NYPD law enforcement who went in to basically help the people come down.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And as a result of their sacrifice, obviously, you know, they ended up losing their life.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And so part of the reason why we remember is to remember the people who gave their lives in the context of saving lives.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You know, it's interesting now that even though that was 19 years ago, just even probably a few months ago,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   you know, we were praising people, you know, especially the first responders, the police officers and firemen,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   you know, they're sacrificing in order to be in the front line to save lives, just like they did in 9/11.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But obviously, the environment has changed drastically overnight,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   where even saying Blue Lives Matter or support of the police is happened, you know, became controversial just overnight.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And it is all the more why it's important for us to remember, right?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   In order for us to remember the people who've sacrificed, but at the same time, to resolve,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   to remember so that stuff like that does not happen again, right?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And the reason why is, again, for us to remember that we have a common enemy.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So some of you guys may remember at that time after it happened,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   the Democrats and the Republicans stood linking arms at Capitol Hill saying that we're united,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   that we're going to fight this together, you know, and that was 19 years ago.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Compare that to what's happening today.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And so it's important for us to remember, remember the sacrifices, remember why that happened,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   remember our common enemy, so that it would affect the way that we view the world today
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and view the world going forward, so that we are cautioned not to allow that to happen again.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Now, all of this to say, this is really, that's really the point that he's getting at, at the text that we're looking at.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Last week we ended with probably the harshest warning that we see in the New Testament.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Basically, he says that if you continue to keep drifting, that there is no sacrifice for sins, right?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And so there is a warning of intense judgment that's coming if you don't take this seriously
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and you continue to drift and thinking like this is okay, you know, and he said there's consequences.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But remember, we also said that the reason why he says this is not simply to make you feel bad
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and feel guilty and feel heavy about your walk with God.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It's to bring sinners to Christ.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So if you are an unbeliever, that there is a judgment, there isn't, you don't just, you know,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   die and then just go into oblivion. The Bible says that you will meet a judge
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and he will judge us based upon all our sins, those that we know of, those that we do not know of.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But even for those Christians, and particularly for those Christians who are drifting
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and is not taking it seriously, that I have all the time in the world, whenever I desire,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I just do whatever I want and I'm just kind of waiting to get to heaven.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And again, it serves as a warning to take this seriously.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   But the goal of what he says is really to bring them to him.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And that's why he says in 32 to 39 to remember.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So there's three things that he tells them to remember. He says to remember the past,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   which is what we're going to be looking at today. And then he says to remember the future,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   the reward that's coming with Christ. And then at the end, he says to remember your current state,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   who you are, right? That we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Remember your identity. So it's to remember your past, remember your future,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and remember the present. So today we're going to be looking at the past, right?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And why he tells us to remember the past, right? So number one,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   exhortation to persevere by remembering the past.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He says in verse 32, remember the former days.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   He's talking about when you first heard the gospel, when after being enlightened.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Obviously, he's not saying remember when you were saved.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   He's talking about when you first heard the gospel.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   We hear a similar talk in Hebrews chapter 6, 4 through 5,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   where he says once you've been enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, have tasted the good word of God
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and powers of the age to come, and then to have fallen away.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So when he says remember when you have been enlightened,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   what he's talking about is when you first heard the gospel.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   For the first time, you were confronted with the resurrected Christ,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and that Christ died for your sins. Remember the impact that that had on you.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   You know, when I was thinking about how, you know, obviously most, if not all of us,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   you know, we're privy to this. We've heard the gospel.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Many of you, multiple times. You've probably presented the gospel.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But when you think about a group of people who have been privileged with God's word,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   there's no other group of people ever that have existed in human history
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   that has the privilege that you and I have.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   We live in a free country. You know, I know we're inconvenienced
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   by sometimes going outside, coming inside, wearing masks,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   and you know, we can't gather here, we can't do this, but you know,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   at best, these are inconveniences.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   But we live in a free country where we can gather together.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   We can worship God freely. We're not worried about police officers
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   or anybody, you know, coming through our door.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   We don't have to worry about our neighbors, you know, attacking us
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   because we happen to be Christians. We live in a free country.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Not only do we live in a free country, the access that we have to the Bible
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   is unprecedented, ever.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   You know, we wrestle with which translation that we're going to have.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And if we don't like this pastor, we go to that pastor.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   If we don't like this church, we go to that church.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   If the church is too far, we want a church that's a little bit closer, you know.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And we wrestle with, well, if you like this book or that book.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We can go online. You wake up three in the morning
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and you happen to hunger for the Word of God, three in the morning.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   You can get the best speakers of our generation
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and you can pick and choose which sermon to listen to.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   You can go to any Bible study that we want.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I mean, the access that we have to the Word of God is unprecedented,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   ever in history, ever.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   There's nobody that has ever lived in human history
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   that has the kind of access to God's Word that you and I have today.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Yet, one of the biggest problems that we have in our generation
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   are people who have access but are not interested in reading.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   You know, one of the challenges of doing ministry in Orange County
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   in our generation is constantly trying to get Christians who are bored
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   to pay attention.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   People ask me, you know, because we were so involved with China
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   for so many years doing missions.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   You know, at one time I counted, when we had about 200 people at church,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I counted up to about 160 plus that went to China for short-term missions.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And then we had over 30 to 40 people who actually lived there
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   for a short term, for half a year to a year and a half to two years.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So we were heavily engaged in China.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And so, obviously, people ask me,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   "What caused you to have a heart for China?"
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   It wasn't China per se.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I remember in 1993 I went in there with my seminary professor
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   and a small group of the students, and we went there for a vision trip.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And I remember going further away from the main city.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   We were traveling the Silk Road, and I happened to be at a small university,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and we were speaking English, and one of the students there
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   heard us speak English and was intrigued.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So he came down and started having a conversation with us.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And then, so obviously, I took that opportunity to try to share the gospel with him.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And then I mentioned the name Jesus, and he said, "Never heard of him."
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I said, "This is a university student. How can you have never heard of the gospel?"
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I know this is a communist country, but this can't be right.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So I thought maybe my accent wasn't good enough,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   or maybe his English isn't good enough.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   So I tried in every way, you know.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And I know that Chinese is closer to Korean,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   so I started using the Korean word "yesu,"
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   because the Chinese word for Jesus sounds more similar to that.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   So I tried everything, and sure enough, after about 15, 20 minutes of conversation,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   he never heard the name Jesus.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   He kind of heard vaguely about Christianity,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   but he had no idea what that was about.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And that just blew my mind, that I ran into somebody
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   in this world that has never heard the gospel.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Now, I've heard of that before, and I always thought that they were way deep in the jungles,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   that we don't have any access to, but this was in a city.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And this is a guy in a university, and he told me he never heard the gospel.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So when I came home, I was thinking, "Wow, we live in a place where
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   we're fighting to keep Christians interested,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   while there's people all over the world who's never heard the gospel."
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   In fact, the actual statistics that the missionaries give
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   is there's over 2 billion people currently
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   who have never heard the gospel.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   2 billion people.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   People ask me about even India,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   like, "What caused you to start going into India?"
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Again, never had interest in India.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's not a place that I was on my bucket list to go and visit.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Happened to have an opportunity to go to teach the--
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   train the local church pastors, and then I realized that through these trips
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   that the most heavily concentrated,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   unreached people groups were in India.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And so that was what caused it.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   "Well, they need the gospel. We have opportunity. Let's go."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And that's kind of what started to open the door.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Because we have so much access to the gospel,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   so much access to the Word, to the Bible study.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Our problem is we take for granted what it is that we have.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And that's really what opened the door to do the ministry out there.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   But when he says he's reminding them, because they're drifting,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   he goes back and he says, "Remember, after you have been enlightened,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   remember the first time you heard the gospel, how precious it was to you?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Remember the first time you heard the gospel."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   If you are a genuine believer now, if you grew up in the church,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   you may not remember the very first time you heard it,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   because you probably heard it from your parents, your Sunday school teachers,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and at some point it made more sense to you.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And it may have been gradual.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   But whenever that point was,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   whether it was a specific time that you can remember,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   or whether it was a period that you remember,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   all of a sudden your ears became open.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And the impact that it had on your life,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   all of a sudden your paradigm of how you looked at the world completely changed.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And it wasn't because of discipleship.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It wasn't because you were sitting through good teachings for years and years and years.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It was just the impact of the reality of Christ and what He has done.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And you were literally enlightened.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Something that you didn't know became real to you all of a sudden.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   He said, "Remember that."
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And the reason why He starts at that point,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   He doesn't point to discipleship,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   He doesn't point to years of training.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Again, there's nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   But He says, "The reason why you're drifting is because you have forgotten this.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   You have forgotten the power of the cross when you were first enlightened."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And then He says, "Because you were enlightened, remember verse 32,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   how you endured great conflict of suffering."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Verse 33, "They became public spectacles through reproaches and tribulation."
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   It wasn't simply that they didn't get accepted in society
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   or people were pointing fingers or snickering at them.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   He said it was a public spectacle.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Remember the text that we're looking at in Thessalonica?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Apostle Paul got chased out of there.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Again, Apostle Paul was no coward.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   He was not afraid of hardship.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   He was willing to give his life.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Remember when he was in Lystra,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that's where he picks up Timothy,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   he was dragged out of town and stoned,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   and they left him there thinking that he was dead.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Remember what Paul does? He doesn't die from that.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He gets back up, he shakes off the dust, he goes back into Lystra.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And then he preaches the gospel.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   So Apostle Paul didn't run out of Thessalonica
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   because he was afraid of the persecution.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So imagine how intense this persecution was in Thessalonica.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   He didn't leave because of himself.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He left because they were starting to persecute Jason
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   and the other Christians who converted,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and in order for their safety, he ended up withdrawing,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and he writes that letter in order to check up on them
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   because he had to leave.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   So when they're talking about this persecution,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   it's nothing that I think any Christian in our generation
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   have experienced, at least where we live.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He said they were public spectacles.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   When they say they were public spectacles,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   it means that's how bold they were.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   This wasn't just, you know, just snickering or stabbing you
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   or doing something in secret.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   They were very open about their hatred toward these Christians.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   He says, "Remember when you first enlightened,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   "you became a public spectacle through reproaches
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   "and tribulation."
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And then he says in verse 14, "They accepted joyfully."
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Remember when the intense persecution--
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Remember how joyfully you accepted the seizure
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   of your property.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So I want you to let that sink in,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   the degree of persecution that they faced.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And the purpose of him writing this
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   is so that they would remember that
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and help them to persevere going forward.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Now think about that.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   If your goal is to encourage them
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   in the midst of intense persecution
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   to go forward, why would you remind them of that?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   You say, "You know, I know it was hard in the past.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   "I know it was intense."
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   But keep praying.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Keep enduring because God is faithful.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   He's going to protect you.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You know people are going to come to Christ
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and the persecution is going to die down eventually.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   The church is going to gain power
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and eventually that's going to die down.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   So don't worry about it.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   He doesn't do that.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   In order to strengthen them to persevere,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   he reminds them, "Remember when your property was being taken?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   "Remember when you were like public spectacle?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   "Remember when it was intense?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   "Remember how difficult that was?"
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   But the key to what he is saying is,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   he says, "Joyfully."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   He's bringing that back up
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   because in the midst of all of that suffering,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   he's reminding them the joy that they experience
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   in this suffering.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   See, to a non-Christian,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   this makes absolutely no sense.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Why would you encourage people to persevere
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   in their faith in the midst of suffering
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and reminding them of the intense suffering in the past
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   in order to get them encouraged to continue to go forward?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Because the key to this wasn't suffering,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   wasn't their circumstance.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It was when they were enlightened.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The gospel made such a big impact in them
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   when they first heard it
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   that even in their suffering,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   they experienced tremendous joy.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   That's what he was reminding them.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   He wasn't reminding them of how happy they were
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   because their possessions were being taken
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   or some of them were being dragged to jail
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   or losing their life.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   That wasn't his point.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   He said, "Even in the midst of all of that,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   "remember the impact that the gospel had on you,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   "that even in the midst of this,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   "you were joyful?"
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   He says, "Remember that?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   "That's what you've drifted away from."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So the problem wasn't the circumstance.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   He wasn't encouraging them saying,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   "Hey, the circumstances are going to change,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   "so your outlook in life is going to look a lot better."
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   He doesn't promise them any circumstance.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   He doesn't promise these people
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   who are facing intense suffering and saying,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   "If you just hold on just a little bit,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   "God's going to answer your prayer
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   "and take care of your kids,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   "and things are going to be okay."
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   He doesn't promise any of that.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   He says, "Remember when you were in a similar circumstance,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   "but you were joyful."
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   But where did that joy come from?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Were they better trained in the beginning?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Did they know their theology better in the beginning?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Did they have better discipleship in the beginning?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Was the church better organized in the beginning?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   No.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He said the impact of the gospel,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   when they first heard it, was so powerful.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It was the gospel that impacted them so deeply
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   that it changed them and looked at,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   even in the context of suffering,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   they saw God, and they had hope.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That's what he was reminding them of.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   See, in Acts 5, 40-41, you see the disciples,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   who just a few weeks earlier,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   they were cowering because Jesus was being crucified.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Their master who protected them,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   he goes to the cross, and they're confused,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   and then they're hiding.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   They're running.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It's Acts 5, 40-41.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   After they encounter the resurrected Christ,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   the Holy Spirit comes and gives them the power
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   that he promised.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   They preach the gospel,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   and those same people who crucified Christ
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   drags them into their presence,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   beats them, and warns them, and says,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   "If you keep doing this, possibly you may lose your life."
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And this is what it says, Acts 5, 40-41.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   "They took his--and after calling the apostles in,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   they flogged them and ordered them not to speak
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   in the name of Jesus, and they released them."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Verse 41.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   "So they went on their way from the presence of the council,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   rejoicing that they had been considered worthy
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   to suffer shame for his name."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Not only do they refuse to stop,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   they went out and said,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   "Wow, God considered me faithful.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   He allowed us to suffer.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Even after their failure,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   he allowed me to suffer."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Now again, for a non-Christian,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   this is ridiculous.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   There's no way to explain this to a non-Christian.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Unless you have, yourself,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   have been enlightened by the word of God,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   unless you have been impacted where your paradigm
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   of what is good and what is bad
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   has been radically changed,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   this just sounds like a bunch of crazy people.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Just like your master was crucified,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   we have the power to crucify and kill you too
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   if you continue this, and they come out rejoicing
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   that God considered me faithful, that I would suffer as well.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Philippians 1, 29-30, Paul says to the Philippians,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   "Sitting in prison, for to you it has been granted
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   for Christ's sake, not only to believe in him,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   but also to suffer for his sake.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Experience the same conflict which you saw in me
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and now hear to be in me."
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   He says, "It's been granted to you."
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Compare that to the way that we typically pray.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   How much of our prayer is about protection?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   When we travel, pray for me for protection.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   The weather is bad, pray so that we will be protected.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   The air quality is bad, so pray that we will be protected.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   We're raising our kids, so we pray for our children
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   to be protected.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   How much of our prayer is about being protected
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   from harm outside so that we can live
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   a comfortable, safe life?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Considering that Paul, sitting in prison,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   writing a letter to the people who are outside,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   he says, "It has been granted."
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Completely different than the way that the world thinks.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   It has been granted for Christ's sake.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   He longed for it.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   He desired it, not only to believe in him,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   but also to suffer for his sake.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   He considered it a blessing to be in prison.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   That's why the book of Philippians is about joy.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   In the midst of, in the context of sitting in prison
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and being beaten, why he's reminding the people outside.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   He doesn't say, "Come and get me. Where are you?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   How come you've abandoned me?"
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   The letter is about joy in Christ,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   no matter what circumstance.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   "I've learned the secret of being contented in every and all situations."
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Only an individual who has encountered the resurrected Christ
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and has been enlightened can say what he says.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Otherwise, this is a crazy man.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   It doesn't fit any kind of paradigm that this world teaches.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's not to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Keep on rejoicing.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Keep on rejoicing.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   "So that also at the revelation of his glory,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   you may rejoice with exaltation."
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   you are blessed.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Because the spirit of glory and of God rests in you.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   He said, if you suffer for his name,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   if you want assurance of salvation,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   it's not the only assurance.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   The fact that you are suffering for the name of Christ
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   may be a good indicator that the spirit of Christ is in you.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Because only an individual who has truly been enlightened,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   who has met the resurrected Christ,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   his life no longer is as important.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   When we live the rest of our lives looking for safety and comfort,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   that may be an indicator that our paradigm has not shifted,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   that our hope may not be in the future, but here.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And Christ is only an avenue to have a better life here.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But suffering for Christ makes no sense.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Why would you follow Christ if it means a greater suffering,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   a public spectacle, taking away of your possessions?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   But he reminds them of that.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   He says, remember.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Remember that. Remember when that happened.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   But not only does he say that, he says,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   they experience true fellowship.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   In 33b, he says, becoming sharers with those who are treated.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   The word "sharer" is a word that you probably are very familiar with,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   koinonia.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   you've probably heard that term a lot.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Churches are named koinonia.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Bible studies are named koinonia.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Anytime that Christians gather together for anything,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   we're going to have basketball koinonia,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   we're going to have hiking koinonia,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   we're going to have chess koinonia.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   People throw that word around,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   sometimes not really realizing the significance of that term.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Koinonia basically means to share.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And he's using that term as if you experience true koinonia
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   in the context of suffering.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   If you've ever suffered together for the same thing,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   you experience a glimpse of what that means.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   That's why you see a lot of guys who go to war,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   you know, in the military.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   They come back and they ask, you know, like,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "Oh, were you fighting for the country?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Were you fighting for that?"
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   The common answer that you get from them is,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   "No, I was fighting for my brother.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I was fighting for the guys in the foxholes."
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Because they became brothers.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   No matter what the background was, no matter what skin color,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   they come out of that foxhole after suffering together
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   and fighting together, risking their lives together,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   there's a bond that they have for the rest of their lives.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And it may have been 40 years ago,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   but every time they got together, they always tell the story
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   of how they suffered together
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   because they became family in that foxhole, suffering together.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So he reminds them, "Remember the koinonia that you had?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Not only did you suffer, but when they suffered,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   you suffered with them.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And you sympathize with them, those who are in prison."
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   The word "sympathy," "sumpateo,"
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   the word is "sumpateo," means "together in emotion."
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   So he didn't just observe people who are suffering from a distance
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   and say, "Thank God that that's not me."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   We worry about the Christians in India,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   we worry about Christians in North Korea and China.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He said, "Thank God that that's not me."
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   But he said, "Remember when you sympathize with them,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   when you suffered along with them,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and as a result, you were sharers with them?"
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   1 Corinthians 12.24, "And if one member suffers,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   all members suffer with it.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   If one member is honored, all members rejoice with it."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   In fact, in Philippians 3.10, Paul says that,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   "I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and the fellowship," koinonia, "of his sufferings,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   being conformed to his death."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   This is why he points to the past.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   This is why he points and says, "Remember in the beginning,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   not because of your hard work, not because you were more determined,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   but simply because you were enlightened
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and the power of the gospel made such an impact on you
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   that fellowship happened."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Suffering, even in the midst of suffering,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   you are rejoicing together,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and you experience what it meant to be a follower of Christ
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   because of the impact of his word in our lives.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And he said, "That's what you've been drifting from."
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Remember when you were first in line, how you suffered.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Public spectacle.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   The fellowship that you experienced.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So that you would stay on track.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   You know, how often we make excuses and say,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "I'm the way I am because I don't have enough of this."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   If I was just at a better church, if I had just better leaders,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   if I had this, if I had better teachers,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   if I had better fellows, if I had older brothers,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   if I had younger brothers, if I had more peers,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and how often do we say, "I'm the way that I am
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   because the circumstances around me are this way,"
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and then just waiting and hoping that if the circumstances would change,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   then I would be much better spiritually.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   But he doesn't point to the future.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   He doesn't say, "Hey, you're missing out on this. Hey, try this new method.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Oh, this church down the street got this new way of organizing small groups,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and that's been working fantastic. Maybe if you did that,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   your spiritual life would be better."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   He doesn't point to any of that.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   He says, "Remember, in the beginning, in the beginning,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   they weren't more trained in the beginning.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They weren't more theologically astute in the beginning.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   They don't have years of bearing fruit in the beginning.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   The churches were not organized in the beginning.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   They didn't have any of that.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   They didn't have formal established leadership in the beginning.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   The only thing that they had was they encountered God
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   through the preaching of the Word.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   When you were enlightened, the impact of the Gospel caused you to react.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   He said, "Remember that. Remember that.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Remember what you had.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   If you have Jesus and you have the Word of God,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   you have everything that you need for a life of godliness.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Everything else is extra."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   No Christian, especially in this generation,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   can ever come before God and say, "I am in the condition that I am
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   because my circumstance is this way.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I have everything that I need in Christ."
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Because everything that he's explaining about these Christians,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   they had in the beginning.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   In the beginning.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   So he's reminding them, "Remember Christ.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Remember Christ that you drifted from."
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   See, if you study the Old Testament in particular,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   go back and when you read through the Old Testament,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   circle how many times God says to remember.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Circle how many times. I challenge you.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   There isn't a single book, single letter that you will read
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   that isn't saturated with that term or something similar to that to remember.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Because God already knows our tendency to drift.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   In Deuteronomy chapter 4, 9, way before they ever entered into the Promised Land,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   God is reminding them.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   After he showed them all the miracles,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   after he delivered them in a fantastic way,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   in challenging the idols of Egypt,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   crossing the Red Sea,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   and giving them the law, this is what he says.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   "Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   so that you do not forget."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   You notice how he says, "Give heed to yourself."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   How much of our time and effort is giving heed to what's going on around us?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Who we're surrounded by?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And he says, "No, the greatest danger is yourself."
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   The greatest danger is not politics.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   The greatest danger is not the protest.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   The greatest danger is not what's happening around us.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   He says, "The greatest danger is in you."
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "Give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently."
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   This is just another way of saying, what?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   "Hold fast the confession of your faith," which he just said previously.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   "Give heed to yourself, keep your soul diligently,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   so that you do not forget."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   In other words, if you're anchored in Christ,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   if you're anchored in Christ,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   no matter what happens outside of us,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   you will experience joy.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Even in the midst of intense persecution,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   even in the midst of getting your possessions taken,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   if you're anchored in Christ, and you do not forget,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   you have everything you need.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   But the moment you drift from your anchor,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   all of a sudden your possessions become an issue.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Your health becomes the issue.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Your relationships become the issue.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Your business becomes an issue.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Everything becomes a greater problem,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   because naturally that's the world that we live in.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   But the only way to live in a paradigm unlike this world
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   is to be anchored with the One who radically changes this paradigm.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And that's what he's getting to.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   That's why he says, "Remember," Deuteronomy 8, 10-14,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   which I command in you today."
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And then verse 12, "Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   and have built good houses and lived in them,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   and when your herds and your flocks multiply,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have multiplies,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   then your heart will become proud.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   You will forget the Lord your God,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   who brought you out from the land of Egypt,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   out of the house of slavery."
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   He says, "I'm going to take you into a land
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   flowing with milk and honey, and I'm going to bless you,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   not because you're great, not because you're many in number,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   but because of the covenant that He made with their forefathers.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   So I'm going to be faithful to myself, and I'm going to take you in.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   But once you experience that blessing, be careful,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   because your heart's naturally going to think,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   'I don't really need Him.'"
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And again, that's a challenge where you and I live.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   We want Him, but we don't feel like we need Him.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And so, when we drift, we want Him, we should have Him,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   but there's no urgency, because we've forgotten that we need Him.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And that's exactly what happens to the nation of Israel.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   God sends Hosea to the nation of Israel,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   telling them why judgment is coming.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He's telling them, "It's coming.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I've loved you like Hosea was loving Gomer, the prostitute."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He said repeatedly, He sends Hosea to love this unfaithful wife.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   All of that to illustrate this was the relationship with God
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and the nation of Israel.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   No matter how much I showed grace,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   no matter how much I was patient with you,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   you kept on going and kept on going, kept on going,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   because you forgot.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And this is what He says, Hosea 13.6,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   "As they had their pasture, they became satisfied.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And being satisfied, their hearts became proud;
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   therefore, they forgot me."
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   That was the summary of the nation of Israel
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and why judgment was coming.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   That's a challenge that you and I have,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   because we have a good job, we have a good home.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Our biggest problem is the weather.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Our biggest problem is the political environment,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   getting a better job, getting a better car, safety,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   our families, and again, in the eyes of the world,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   of course these things are important.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And it would make no sense to say rejoice in suffering,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   because it would make no sense in the world.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Only those who have encountered the resurrected Christ,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   that even in death there is hope in Christ.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   That's the Christ that the disciples encountered
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   that caused them to be willing.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Before the resurrection of Christ,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   even as they were following Christ, who's the greatest?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   When the kingdom comes, let me sit on the left,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   let me sit on the right, that's what they were consumed with.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   But after the resurrection, after they encountered
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   this resurrected Christ, that even in death,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   there is glory.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   In fact, if you die in the name of Christ,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   for His name, there's greater glory for Him.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Only a Christian who've encountered this Christ
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   can even understand what's being said here.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   That's why it says in Revelation chapter 2, 5,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   to this church who is just going through the motion,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   who lost and forsaken their first love, he says,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   "Therefore remember from where you have fallen,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   "and repent and do the deed you did at first,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   "or else I am coming to you and will remove your lambs
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   "and out of its place unless you repent."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   This is how important it is.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   It is not just one of many things that we need to deal with.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   It is at the heart of everything that we're doing.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   If we've been waiting for circumstances to change
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   or things to happen or when our children get a little bit older,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   when my bills are paid, my relationships get a little bit better,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   then I can give my full attention to Christ.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   This is a reminder, he said, "No, remember the height
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   "from which you had fallen.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   "Remember when you first encountered Christ.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   "Remember the joy that you felt.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   "Remember even as other people were suffering,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   "the fellowship that you experienced."
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   As I was preparing the sermon, I started to kind of comb through,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   in my mind, trying to remember for myself.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I started thinking about, even for me,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I remember when I first met Christ.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I was just singing.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I was just--it's just mind-blowing.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   God is real.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   I grew up in the church memorizing Scripture, the Lord's Prayer,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   things that I had no understanding.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I just repeated because I just taught.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   And then at the age of 16, my eyes got open,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   and I remember just thinking, like every day I was thinking about
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   some verse that I memorized at BBS or the Lord's Prayer,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and all of a sudden it started making sense.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   It's like, "Oh, that's why. Oh, that's what that means.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   "Oh, that's what that means."
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And I remember coming down from that mountain thinking,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   "Nothing's going to be the same."
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   It changed everything.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Bitterness I had.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And I remember, like, the thing that I struggled with the most
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   is, like, where do I fit in?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   I'm not a Korean. I'm not American.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   And I just wanted to be normal.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   You know, most people want to exceed other people.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   That was not my dream. My dream is to be normal.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I want to be normal height, normal weight.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I just want to be normal. You know what I mean?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   So I don't have great aspirations.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I just want to be average and walk into a room
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   and nobody looks at you. It's like, "Who's that guy?"
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Because I struggled with fitting in.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And I remember meeting Christ thinking, like, "Wow."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   But that burden was lifted instantaneously when I met Christ.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And whatever that was so important to me was no longer important.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And all I wanted to do was to go to Bible study.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   All I wanted to do was sing songs and pray with these people
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   and fellowship and, you know.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   I remember early in college, there's a--
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   in Biola, there's this chapel called Rosemayor Chapel.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And it was in between the classes. I was going back and forth.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   And it was always open, you know.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   So I remember how much I loved being in that room
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   because Christ was--He was so real to me
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   that sometimes I didn't have anything to pray about.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   But I prefer being with Christ in that room
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   more than whatever else that was going on outside.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And I remember there were times that I would sit for an hour
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   or two hours just sitting there, just thinking about who He is
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   and just conversing with Christ. And it was never a burden.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   It was just something that I preferred, you know,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   than my friends just having silly, goofy time outside.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   I think about how I wanted so much to share the gospel.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   You know, I dreamt about meeting non-Christians
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and sharing the gospel, bringing gospel to the lost.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And I remember reading Jim Elliott in his journal
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   right before he went out to Ecuador.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   He says in his journal, and this is not verbatim, he says,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   "Lord, I'm not asking for a long life, but passionately,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   courageously, live fully.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   And even if I die early, that I would be burnt out for Christ."
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And I remember reading that being so challenged
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   that that's what I want.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I'm not asking for a long, safe life.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   I want to just run as hard as I can, as fast as I can,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   and share the gospel to as many people as I can
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and then burn out for Christ and die.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   But I have to admit, since then I've gotten married.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   I've got--raised four kids, pay the bills.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I have responsibilities in the church.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Too many relationships that went sour, you know.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I get PTSD in relationship, PTSD in church.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   And constantly being concerned and trying to overcome
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   the jadedness that kind of creeps in in my heart.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And at times it just kind of kills the joy that I have.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   When I hear somebody's a Christian,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   my first reaction isn't, "That's awesome."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   My first reaction is, "What kind of Christian are you?"
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And to be honest, there are some days
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   where I catch myself just trying to ride this out till the end.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   And as I was thinking about what he was saying here to remember,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   and I remember, I remember many of you
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   when you first came to Christ.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Some of you wrestled with being forsaken from your family
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   because you were making a decision to follow Christ.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   I remember praying with you and crying together.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I mean, I have so many memories.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I can't jot it down.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   You know, I wanted to share some, but it would take too long.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   It is our natural tendency to drift.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And this is why we need to take some time to remember,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   to think about what it is that we value.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Remember when you first met Christ?
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Remember how these songs meant so much to you?
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Remember when you wanted to literally give your life
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   to share the gospel?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   How fellowship meant so much to you?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   How you wanted to pray,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   "Lord, I want to be burnt out for Christ."
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And then life happened.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Had children, responsibilities.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Now we're just making it from week to week, month to month, year to year.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   You know, thinking like passion for Christ is something that kids do.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And now that I've gotten to a certain age,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   we're just going to ride this out.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And I notice a danger even in my own heart,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   not to allow myself to drift in that way.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   This is why he writes this.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   All of this really is summarized in the next chapter,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Psalm 11 verse 1, where he says,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   "Now faith is assurance of things hoped for
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   and the conviction of things not seen."
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   If we live by our flesh,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   it's natural that we're going to drift.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   It's natural to be discouraged when you can't pay your bills,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   your work doesn't go right,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   your relationship with your husband and wife
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   isn't exactly what you want it to be.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   If we live by our flesh and what we see,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   our discouragement and encouragement, our joy, our sadness
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   is going to go up and down based upon what is happening around us.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   But we do not live by sight.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   We are people of faith.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And so we live with a conviction,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   an assurance of what we do not see.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And that's what he's trying to remind them of.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Remember when you first heard the gospel.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Remember how joyful you were.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Remember how excited you were.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Do the height from which you had fallen.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Repent and redo the thing that you did at first.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Let's pray.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Heavenly Father,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   we are weak creatures in need of your grace, even now.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Even after 36 years,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I am desperately in need of you.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   I pray, Father God, that you would help us as a church not to drift.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   To heed the warning that you've given us,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   that our view of what we hope for,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   what we value, what we believe,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   will recalibrate our mind, our thought, our hearts, and our lives.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   That whether we live long,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   or even just a few months,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   help us, Lord God, to truly live for your glory.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   So I pray, Father God, in the midst of this chaos,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   that we would not run to the hills for safety.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   That you would remind us to be anchored in Christ,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
