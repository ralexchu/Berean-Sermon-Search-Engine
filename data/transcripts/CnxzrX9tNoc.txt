[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   So live from an undisclosed location with the sultry filter on
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.960]   Very sultry filter on
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.880]   Yeah
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.400]   Having a great hair day. Yeah, that is a good hair day for you. Great hair day my pal and
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   your
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080]   Favorite CEO and Twitterer. Mr. Elon Musk. How you doing pal?
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080]   [Applause]
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:50.680]   Appreciate you coming to the event and coming zooming in. Yeah, what's new in your world?
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   Well, let's see, I guess right now I'm sort of debating the number of bots on Twitter
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.680]   With Prague on Twitter
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   and
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.080]   The currently I'd like to what I'm being told is that the there's just no way to know
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.480]   The number of bots it's like as unknowable as the human soul basically
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.480]   [Laughter]
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   Witchcraft and alchemy is needed to determine these bot percentage
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.840]   I said like why don't try calling people, but I haven't got a response, you know, like if you try calling people or something, you know
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.840]   like maybe
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   Do they answer? It's not a bot?
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.720]   No, I don't know
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.480]   But I think like that would be one of the things to do to say like
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.280]   Have you tried calling them as opposed to trying to read the tea leaves here? That's like impossible
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280]   you know
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.280]   Obviously you can have an account that looks exactly like a human account or is being operated where one person is operating a thousand accounts
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.760]   or something
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.240]   But that person can only buy one toaster. They're not gonna buy a thousand toasters
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.660]   So you care about like number of unique real people that are on the system?
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.040]   it's extremely fundamental and anyone who uses Twitter as well aware that
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.800]   the their comment the comment threads are are full of spam spam and and
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.920]   Just a lot of you know, fake accounts. So
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   it seems
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.560]   Beyond beyond reasonable for Twitter to claim that the number of
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.000]   Essentially the number of real said another way the number of real unique humans
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   That you see making comments on a daily basis on Twitter is above 95%
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   That is what they're claiming. Does anyone have that experience?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   I mean...
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.480]   *applause*
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.280]   There's a bridge I'd like to sell you, you know
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   *laughter*
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   *laughter*
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   And also you can buy the Brooklyn Bridge
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   *laughter*
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   What do you think it is?
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   What do you yeah, what's the I mean
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   If it's not 5% what is it?
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   I think it's a number that is probably at least four or five times that number
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   I'd say at
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   if you did sort of the
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   the lowest estimate would be probably 20%
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   and this is a bunch of
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   quite smart outside firms have done analysis of Twitter and
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   looked at the sort of daily users and
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   their conclusion is also about 20%
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   but that's a lower bound
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   it's not an upper bound
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   if you look at say
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   the most liked tweets on Twitter
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   so I have the honor of
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   having the most liked tweet of any living human
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   Thank you everyone for liking my tweet
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   including you, some of the bots out there
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   but
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   that tweet is less than 5 million likes
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   it's like 4.7 or something like that
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   and that was the
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   where I tweeted about
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   that next time buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   it's clearly something that the public really wants
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.280]   Coca-Cola Corporation should really think about going back to their roots
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   from O.E. Coca-Cola
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   I mean this I guess is the reason why our grandparents could
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   sort of walk 20 miles in the snow
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   because they had Coca-Cola with cocaine
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   this is real reasoning
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   *laughter*
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   anyway that is literally the most popular tweet
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.280]   of any living human
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   but Twitter says that the sort of monetizable daily active users is 217 million
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   so why would it be that the most popular tweet ever basically is
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   only 2, 2.5% of the entire user base
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   this seems a very, very low number
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   and the most popular tweets generally are clustered around that 4 million like level
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.280]   so it's basically 2% or less than 2% of the daily active users
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   and technically monetizable daily active users is how Twitter refers to it
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   so it just seems, how is this possible?
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   surely there's something that maybe 10% of people would like
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   not merely 2%
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   well actually if you think about it Elon
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   there's a corollary on YouTube
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   what's the total user base of YouTube
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   and what have the most popular videos gotten there
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   and I think there's a billion or two, maybe a billion people using YouTube
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.280]   and the most popular videos have tens of billions of views
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   that might be instructive
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   exactly, that ratio makes a lot more sense
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   so something doesn't add up here
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   and my concern is not that is it like 5% or 7% or 8%
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   but is it potentially 80% or 90% bots
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   I mean I certainly know there's some real people on Twitter
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   but is it an order of magnitude
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   is it 50% instead of 5
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   and that's obviously an incredibly material number
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   especially since Twitter relies primarily on brand advertising
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   as opposed to specific click through advertising where you make a purchase
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   if you make a purchase it doesn't really matter that much
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   but for brand advertising which is really just awareness advertising
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   it matters if real humans are seeing that or not
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   yeah and so I guess stepping back for a second
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   people are curious why you want to buy Twitter
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   why is this so important to you
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.280]   and then I guess what are the chances you think the deal gets done at this point
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   so a two-parter
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   why is it so important to you
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   I mean some of this I've articulated before
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   but I think there's a need for a public town square
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   digital town square where people can debate issues of all kinds
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   including the most substantive issues
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   and in order for that to be the case
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   you have to have something that is as broadly inclusive as possible
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.280]   that has as much of the people on the platform as possible
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   where it feels balanced from a political standpoint
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.280]   it's not biased one way or the other
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   and where the system is transparent
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   this is why I think it's important to put the algorithm on GitHub
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.280]   and actually allow the public to see it and critique it and improve it
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   and if there are any manual changes
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   sort of shadow banning as it's called
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   or increasing or decreasing the prominence of a tweet
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   that's done manually that that should be noted
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   so you know what has happened
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.280]   and it's not just you know
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   you're just where it is right now
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   we don't know what the heck is going on
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   why is one tweet doing well
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   why is another tweet not
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.280]   is it the algorithm
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   did someone manually intervene
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   why are some accounts banned
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   with no recourse apparently
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   and you know the reality is
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   that Twitter at this point you know has a very far left bias
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   and I would classify myself as a moderate
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   neither Republican nor Democrat
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   and in fact I have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats historically
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   overwhelmingly
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   I'm not sure
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   I might never have voted for a Republican just to be clear
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   now this election I will
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   [laughter]
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   well David you okay?
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   David Sachs is fainted
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.280]   keep going keep going he's fine
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   we're going to resuscitate him
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   we're going to resuscitate David Sachs
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   I mean let me ask you a personal question
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   the point I'm trying to make is that this is not some sort of attempt to
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   you know it's not some right wing takeover
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   as say people on the left may fear
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   but rather a moderate wing takeover
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   and an attempt to ensure that people of all political beliefs
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   feel welcome on a digital town square
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   and they can express their beliefs
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   without fear of being banned or shadow banned
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   and that we obviously need to get rid of the bots
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   and scams and trolls
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   and people that are operating huge bot armies
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   in an attempt to unduly influence the public opinion
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   so this is what I think is very important that we have that
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   like the some of the smartest people in history have thought about it
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   and said like free speech is important
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   for a healthy democracy it is important
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   and free speech only matters
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   [applause]
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   like say when does free speech matter most
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   it's when someone you don't like
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.280]   saying something you don't like
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   that's when it actually matters
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.280]   so you know obviously
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   and it's pretty annoying when someone you don't like
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   says something you don't like
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   that's bad but it's actually a good sign
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   that you have free speech
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.280]   so I mean I get trashed by the media all the time
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   it's fine I don't care
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   do it twice as much I couldn't care less
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   but it's indicative of the fact that even though
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   I have like a lot of resources
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   I do not actually have the ability to stop the media from trashing me
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   and that's actually a good thing
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   yeah I have to ask
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   with regard to this current administration
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   I know how hard you work on the car company
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   and then Biden you know
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   you've been a lifelong democrat
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   you've donated to Obama and to everybody
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   probably never voted Republican
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.280]   and yet
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   and the same is true for Joe Rogan
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   Joe Rogan is you know a Bernie Sanders supporter
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   and that the Democratic Party has been openly hostile to Joe Rogan
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   and Biden can't even say the word Tesla
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   or invite you to the White House when they do an EV summit
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   I'm curious just on a very personal basis
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   what does it feel like to have that experience
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   where the party you supported
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   won't even say the name of your company
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   or invite you there
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   they should be celebrating the work you're doing
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   yeah I mean it definitely feels like this is not right
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   like this is
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   the issue here is that
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   there's just
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.280]   the Democrat Party is overly controlled by the unions
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.280]   and by the trial lawyers
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   particularly the class action lawyers
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   and generally if you'll see something that is not in the interest of the people
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   on the Democrat side it's going to come because of the unions
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   which is just another form of monopoly
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   and the trial lawyers
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.280]   that's where actions will be happening
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   from the Democrat side
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   they're not in the interest of the people
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   and then to be fair on the Republican side
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   if you say like where is something like not ideal happening
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.280]   it's because of corporate evil
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   and religious zealotry
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   that's generally where the bad things will be coming from
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   on the Republican side
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   that are not representative of the people
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   so in the case of Biden
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   he is simply too much
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   captured by the unions
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   which was not the case with Obama
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   so in the case of Obama you could have
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   he was quite reasonable
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   and I think he took more of a view
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   that obviously you need to take the concerns of the unions into account
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.280]   but there are bigger issues at stake
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   and unfortunately Biden does not do that
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   Elon I have a Tesla question
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   I read today it's incredible
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.280]   there was a Bloomberg article that said the following
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.280]   so the setup is this
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   it said since you went public
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   Tesla is up 22,000%
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   11 quarters of sequential profitability
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   so hitting on all cylinders
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   but the public analyst
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   we had cylinders
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   that's a car joke
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   that's a combustion
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   we're stepping on the gas pedal
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   firing on all cylinders
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.280]   people judged
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   but analysts
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   when they put out their projections
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   it's one of the most enormous bans for any company in America
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   the price targets for Tesla
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.280]   despite all of this success
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   some have it at 200, some have it at 1600
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   it's all over the place
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.280]   you tweeted a couple of months ago
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.280]   Tesla is not a company
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   it's like 6 companies inside of a company
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   you've had to build this
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.280]   can you just explain to people
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.280]   all these companies inside this super company
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   just so folks have a sense of what had to be done to get here
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   okay
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   this question requires thought
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   and I'll probably be leaving out quite a few things
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   but if you look at say what
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   what does a typical car company do
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   what they do is they
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   they assemble vehicles
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.280]   and they send them to dealers
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   and they manage the supply chain
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   they might make the engine
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   typically will make the engine
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   but most of the parts are made by suppliers
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   and a lot of the actual technology development is done by suppliers
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   and most of the vehicle software is done by suppliers
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   so the actual amount of real work done by car companies
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   what you think of sort of like a GM or Ford
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   is not actually that much
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.280]   so they don't do sales
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.280]   they don't do service
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   so in the case of Tesla for example
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   we do our own sales and service
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   we don't have dealerships
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   then Tesla also has by far the biggest network of superchargers
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.280]   sort of the electric equivalent of gas stations
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   so we built an entire global supercharger network
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   which is still the most advanced and by far the best
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   way to charge your car when traveling long distance
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   or if you live in a city
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   and don't have the ability to charge your car
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   because of street parking or an apartment
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.280]   so the whole supercharger network
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.280]   we developed the supercharger network
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280]   we deployed it
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   I think we have 15,000 superchargers globally
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   you can travel anywhere in America right now
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   with the Tesla supercharger network
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   then in terms of vertical integration
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   we make the battery pack
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   the power electronics, the drive unit
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   we're more integrated in the parts
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.280]   we actually make so much of the car internally
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   we're vertically integrated
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   not necessarily because we think
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   there's some religious reason to be vertically integrated
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.280]   but because the pace at which we needed to move
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   was just much faster than the supply chain could move
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   and to the degree that you inherit the legacy supply chain
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   you inherit the legacy constraints
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.280]   including their speed, cost, and technology
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   and then Tesla is as much a software company
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   as it is a hardware company
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   so the software that runs in Tesla
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   operates the car, operates the screen
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.280]   does the charging
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   all of that stuff is developed by Tesla
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   and so we have sort of a car
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.280]   a Tesla OS in the car
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   I could go on for a long time
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   and then very importantly
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:14.280]   Tesla has built an autopilot AI team from scratch
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.280]   that is the best real-world AI team on earth
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   and if anyone else has got a better one
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   I'd like to see it demonstrated in a car
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.280]   the full self-driving beta at this point
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   can very often take you with zero interventions
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   across the Bay Area from San Jose to Marin
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   so through complex traffic
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   it's really quite sophisticated
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   and I invite anyone to join the beta
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   or look at the videos of those who are in the beta
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   we've got like 100,000 people in the beta
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   so it's not tiny
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.280]   and we'll be expanding that to
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   I don't know, probably a million people
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   or a million, I don't know, on that order
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   by the end of the year
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   so it's...
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.280]   You had the slide
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   We also built a chip team
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   because there wasn't hardware
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   that we could run the friggin' AI on
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.280]   we couldn't just fill the trunk
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   with a whole bunch of GPUs
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   and, you know
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   because they would have created a trunk full of GPUs
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   that would have been very expensive
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   and take a massive amount of power and cooling
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   just to be able to do what the Tesla-designed
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   full self-driving computer can do
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   so and we started a chip team from scratch
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   designed it, it was the best in the world
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   and still is the best in the world
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.280]   several years later
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.280]   and we're also then developing
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   we're designing a dojo supercomputer
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   to be able to process the
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   all the video that's coming in
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   from billions of miles of data
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   because just sort of like the way that
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   it's pretty difficult to compete with Google
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.280]   because they have so much data
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.280]   and they have all these people doing searches all the time
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   and humanity is training it
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   the same is true of Tesla
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   you really need billions of miles
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.280]   ultimately tens of billions of miles of training data
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   combined with a sort of vast training computer
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   and then optimized inference hardware in the car
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.280]   and state-of-the-art AI and training
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.280]   and specialized software across the board
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   to be able to achieve a full self-driving solution
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.280]   I just want
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   when he opened Tesla Gigafactory
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.280]   remember this six or seven years ago?
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   I'll just tell the audience a story quickly, Elon
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   he puts a slide up there and he says
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.280]   guys, we're not actually building a factory
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   we're building a machine that makes machines
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.280]   and he puts the layout of the factory
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   and it looks like a chip
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   and it was basically like how you would actually
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.280]   lay out a microchip if you were
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   or you know, you were like a layout engineer
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   it was the craziest thing I'd ever seen
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.280]   I was like, that was when I first got it
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.280]   you know, you walk on 10 and you see what's happening
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   and you have an insurance company
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   now you're doing insurance for Tesla owners
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   and an Uber competitor
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.280]   right, and eventually a robo-taxi Uber competitor
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   RIP
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   yeah, I mean, insurance is not quite significant
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   now are you okay?
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.280]   I'm okay
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.280]   the car insurance thing is a bigger deal
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   than it may seem
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   a lot of people are paying
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   you know, 30, 40% as much as their lease payment
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   for the car in car insurance
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   so the car insurance industry is incredibly inefficient
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   because they're just
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.280]   first of all, you've got like so many
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   sort of middle entities
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.280]   you've got from the insurance agent all the way to
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.280]   the final sort of reinsurer
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   there's like a half dozen companies each taking a cut
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   and then the
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   it's all very statistical
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   so that there's
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   even if you're a very good driver
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   like you could be like, you know
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   20 years old and a great driver
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   but it's all statistical
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   so you can't get
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.280]   you either can't get insurance or it's extremely expensive
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   so, but Tesla allows for real-time insurance
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   based on how you actually drive the car
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   you can actually
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.280]   if you drive the car
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   in a safer way
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   you actually have lower insurance
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   so ours is
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.280]   insurance is based on how you actually drive
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   not how
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   you know
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.280]   historically people that
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.280]   you know
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   fit your whatever demographic have drive
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.280]   and then you can close the loop
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   around your
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   insurance rate by simply driving better and looking at your score
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   and lowering your insurance in real time
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   and people do it
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.280]   actually promotes safer driving
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.280]   I actually have had this experience because
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   in my household two people drive my car
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   and one of them has a 93 score
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.280]   and the other one does not
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.280]   they have like a 60 score
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.280]   and you may have met this other person
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   but I've been trying to work with her
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   on the aggressive turns and stops
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   in advance
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   of our insurance bill
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   which we're hoping will go down
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   at some point
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   you didn't
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   oh the one question
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   is this Twitter deal going to get closed do you think?
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280]   what are the chances here?
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   well
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   I mean it really depends on a lot of factors here
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   I'm still waiting for
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.280]   some sort of logical explanation
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   for the number of
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.280]   sort of fake or spam accounts
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   on Twitter
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.280]   and Twitter is refusing to tell us
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.280]   so
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   you know
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   this just seems like a strange thing
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   wait sorry are they refusing to tell you
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   or you don't think they really know?
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   I mean
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   there's a good chance they may just have no idea
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   they claim that they do know
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   yeah
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.280]   and they claim that they've got this complex methodology
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.280]   that only they can understand
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   [laughter]
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   but the guy who landed two rockets simultaneously
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   you can't understand
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.280]   you stir this cauldron
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   and then you throw the nubble at him
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   and um
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   [laughter]
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   double double
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.280]   hogsworth
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   and then suddenly it comes to you in a dream
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   I don't know
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.280]   [laughter]
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   but there should be some
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   you know objective way to
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   so the thing
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   because this is a this is a material
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.280]   public statement
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.280]   it's a threshold issue yeah
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.280]   it you know it's it's a
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   you know it's a material adverse
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.280]   misstatement
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   you know if they in fact
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   have been
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.280]   vociferously claiming less than five percent
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   of fake or spam accounts
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   but in fact it is four or five times that
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   number or perhaps ten times that number
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   this is a big deal
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.280]   it's not this
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   it seems like if you said okay
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.280]   I'm gonna
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   I agree to buy your house
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   you say the house has less than five percent termites
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   that's
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.280]   that's an acceptable number
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   but if it turns out it is 90 percent termites
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   that's
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.280]   not okay you know
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   it's not the same house
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.280]   [laughter]
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   this house is made mostly of termites
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   [laughter]
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   termites leave
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   it literally
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280]   your house will disappear
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   because it's mostly made of termites
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   um
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   so you know that would obviously just not be appropriate
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   so in making the twitter offer
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   I was obviously reliant upon the the truth
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   and accuracy of their public filings
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   if those those filings are not accurate
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   it's simply
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.280]   not that's that it's
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.280]   it's not you you can't pay the same
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   price for something that
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   is much worse than they claimed
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   and you know they say
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   Elon life's a negotiation so
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   at a different price it might be a
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   totally viable deal correct?
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   I mean that
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.280]   [sigh]
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   I mean
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.280]   it's not out of the question
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.280]   but I really would
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   you know the more questions
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   I ask the more I
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.280]   the more my concerns grow
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.280]   so
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   you know at the end of the day
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   acquiring it has to be fixable
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   and fixable
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   with reasonable time frame
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   and without revenues collapsing along the way
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   and all that sort of stuff
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   and so
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   you know I really need to see
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   how these
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   things are being calculated and it
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.280]   can't be some deep mystery
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   that is like more complex than the human soul
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   or something like that
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.280]   it's gotta be you know
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   I think we can apply the scientific
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   method to this and try to figure out
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   what's really going on
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   and
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.280]   Twitter's revenue is primarily
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   dependent I think 70% or some
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   that order on brand advertising as opposed
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   to specific purchase advertising
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   this is a big deal because brand
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   advertising is not
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   a purchase that results from
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   that so it's basically you know
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   how much mind share or
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   basically if you're a big company how often
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   do they hear your name
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   as opposed to something where you can directly
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   measure the outcome
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   so that means that they're somewhat going on
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.280]   faith and if that faith
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   is undermined or reduced
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   because of the reality of the situation
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   coming to the fore then
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Tesla's revenue
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   Twitter's
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   revenue
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   will be
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.280]   significantly impaired
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   and that's a major problem
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   Elon did you have a chance to ask these questions
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   during your negotiation
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   the
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   I would like to say I was relying upon
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   their public filings
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   to the degree that their public
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   and this is normal for a public company
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   if you make
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   a formal filing
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   that is
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   what investors are relying
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.280]   on whether they are making an
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.280]   acquisition offer or simply buying some
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   shares so
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   the accuracy of these filings
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   is important whether you're buying one share or
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   the whole company and
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   so if these filings are inaccurate
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   if they're
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   potentially blatant
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   it's a big
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.280]   deal. Elon do you have a sense
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   of why this has been such a
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   persistent problem for Twitter do they
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   not have the technical capabilities
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   to solve the bot problem
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.280]   or is it more of like just a
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   they've underprioritized the issue or
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.280]   been unwilling to because potentially there are
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   implications for
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   ad revenue
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   I don't know it's sort of speculative
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   at this point so the
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   the worst interpretation
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   would be that they don't want to look too closely
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   at the thing because they might not like the answer
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   that would be the worst interpretation
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   I'm not sure
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.280]   what the best interpretation is
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   but the least bad interpretation would be
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   maybe they thought it was this way but
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   the way they were doing it was wrong and
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   they didn't realize they were mistaken and simply weren't paying
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   enough attention. It does seem as
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   though it should be a lot easier to get rid of the bots
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.280]   and spam and trolls
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   than, like this is not some
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   we're not trying to split the atom here you know
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   we're not trying to get to
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   the moon okay we're just
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   trying to
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   limit the amount of obviously
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   scammy accounts
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   if it's like
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   a bitcoin giveaway
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   you know probably
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   it's a spammer you know
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.280]   like
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.280]   maybe you know
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   wait you're not giving away a hundred bitcoins?
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   I just
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   sent you ten either
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.280]   if you send me
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   two bitcoin I'll send you one back
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   right that's my
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   what if I send you twenty
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   actually I thought one of
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.280]   the interesting things that came up in
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   your product roadmap or
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   I guess this was released and
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   people covered it was the
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   possibility of
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   Twitter becoming kind of a super app with
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   payments included
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   perhaps even doge or something
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   this seems to me based on
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   your work with David at PayPal
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   a pretty brilliant idea what's
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   the vision there in terms of if you were
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.280]   able to buy it you know perhaps at the right price
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   what would it
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.280]   look like if you know I could
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   add Jason to add Elon Musk
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.280]   you know ten bucks or something if you know
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   we were splitting a check or something
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   sure well
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.280]   for those that have used WeChat
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   I think that's WeChat's actually a good
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   model if you're in China
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   it's basically you kind of live on WeChat
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   it does everything
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   it's sort of like Twitter plus PayPal plus
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   a whole bunch of other things and Oral
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.280]   is one with actually a great interface and
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   it's really an excellent app
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   and we don't have anything
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.280]   like that outside of China
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.280]   so
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.280]   I think such an app
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   would be really
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   useful and
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   just like the utility
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   of it of sort of
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.280]   a spam free
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.280]   thing where you can make comments
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   post videos
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   I think it's important for
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   content creators to have a revenue share
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   now this does not
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.280]   need to be done on Twitter it could be done from
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   something that's created from scratch
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.280]   so it could be something new
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   so really but I think this
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   thing needs to exist whether it is
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   converting Twitter to
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   be the sort of like
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   kind of all encompassing
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.280]   app that like I said everything
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   from digital town square where important ideas are
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   debated
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   you know maximally trusted and inclusive
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   and at a point where you
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   sort of have a high trust situation then
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.280]   payments whether it's
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   crypto or fiat
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   can make a lot of sense
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.280]   you just want
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.280]   something that's incredibly useful and that people
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   love using
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.280]   so that
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.280]   it's either convert Twitter to that
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   or start something new those are the two
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   but it does need to happen
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   somehow well it's interesting
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   you bring that up because the price of
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   Twitter is pretty high
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   and you've built a couple of companies
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   and some engineers like to come work for you
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.280]   and you've now gone through the
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   intellectual exercise of studying all this
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.280]   if you're looking at the two
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   choices now fixing Twitter given
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   all these problems and maybe just starting
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   your own version which one are you
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   leaning towards because I have watched
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   you build a couple of companies and the
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.280]   products have turned out pretty good
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   so is it easier for someone like you to just start
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   from scratch I mean
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   it's certainly
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   my default inclination
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   is to start things from scratch
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   I'm not really I don't buy things
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.280]   like there's still this sort of
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   you know
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   like SpaceX was started from scratch
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   you know
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   in the case of Tesla
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   you know it
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   was like five people
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   this guy who's the worst guy I've
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   ever worked with who tries to claim like sole
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   credit essentially for creating
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.280]   Tesla and if he's so damn great why don't you just go
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.280]   you know create another car company when he was fired
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   but anyway
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.280]   so
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   I mean that's a pretty good story I mean
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.280]   yeah I remember
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.280]   I mean no but
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   I remember having this conversation with you
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   we were having a conversation about the
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   Roadster I think I can tell the story
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   I said how's it going pal and you said well I got one
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   problem
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   it turns out the Roadster parts
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   and putting it together cost a hundred and ninety thousand
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.280]   and I said I gave you a hundred
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   and fifty for number sixteen so
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   if you make two thousand of these you're going to lose eighty
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   million dollars and you were like yeah
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.280]   or double that I mean they basically
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.280]   the parts of the car
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   cost more than they were selling it for
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   when you were starting to get involved
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   that's it was this
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   I got involved well before that
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   well before that yes
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   when Tesla was
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   nothing but a piece of paper
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   let me be crystal clear
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.280]   crystal fucking clear
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   no they didn't bring me in
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.280]   either
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   I was going to
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   start an EV
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   company with JV Struggle
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.280]   based on the AC propulsion
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   T0 and when I
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.280]   asked AC propulsion if it was
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.280]   okay to do that they said well
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   there's also some others who want to
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   create an EV company but have not created
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   one yet would you like to
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   join forces with them and I said
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   okay well we'll do that that was a huge
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   mistake JV and I should have just started
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   the car company ourselves instead
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   we teamed up with
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.280]   Eberhard Toppening and Wright
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   big mistake
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.280]   the actual moral error here
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.280]   was me trying to have my cake and eat it too
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   which is like I just want to work
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   on the technology and the product
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   and have someone else be the CEO
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   and sort of run the business operations
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   because I just like working on technology and product
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   and design and
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   also I was like doing SpaceX
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.280]   at the time in Iraq as we were blowing up
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   so it seemed like okay
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   this is like I always wanted to do an electric car
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   company this is how I can have my cake and eat it
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   too that was a huge mistake
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   and fundamentally a moral error
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   and
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   so
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   in the end I had to friggin
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   be CEO and I didn't want to be basically
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   so
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   but it's either that or the company's going to die
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   so we started with really
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   just nothing and
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   the T-Zero
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   prototype from AC Propulsion
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.280]   that's the precursor
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   to Tesla
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   to be one half second clear
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   once again
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   when we created Tesla
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   when I joined
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   there were no employees
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   there was no intellectual property there was no prototype
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   there was no nothing
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   to be crystal fucking clear
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   [Laughter]
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   [Applause]
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   and
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   it almost bankrupted you
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   that sent you to the cliff
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.280]   of insolvency
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   yes we were on the ragged edge
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   of bankruptcy so many times it was ridiculous
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   so
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   2008
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   was one of the worst years where basically
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   the GM
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   and Ford
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   Ford almost
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   went bankrupt and
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   trying to raise money for a startup
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   electric car company in 2008 while GM
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   was going bankrupt was
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   difficult to say the least
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.280]   people were angry that I
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   even asked them
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.280]   for money
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   they were like fuck you and hang up
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   [Laughter]
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   so
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   the only way that
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   Tesla actually made it through 2008 was
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   a subset of the existing investors
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   which
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.280]   includes people like Antonio Gracia
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.280]   and you know
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   Steve Jovitson and
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   a few other key people Ira Aaron Price
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   who
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   I hold a debt of gratitude to this day
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   and
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   I put in all the money I had left
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   and they said everything
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.280]   literally everything
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   I didn't even have a house
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   so
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   this is my ex-wife at the house
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   so I was like staying actually in Jeff Skoll's
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   bedroom, spare bedroom
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   [Laughter]
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   and
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   the
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   subset of the investors would say
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.280]   okay they're putting as much as I put in
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   everything and then we
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   closed that round 6pm
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   Christmas Eve 2008
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.280]   it was the last hour of the last day that was possible
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   because after that people were like breaking for the holidays
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   and we were to bounce payroll two days after Christmas
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   It was
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   pretty... That's doorstep
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   It was an incredible moment in time and people
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   also forget at the time
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.280]   that the first two rockets SpaceX
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   sent up didn't exactly
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   make it to orbit like one of the first three
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   the first three and
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   I remember having dinner with you at that time
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   and I asked you hey how's it going
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   I heard your gawker says you got four
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   weeks of payroll left and you said that's not
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   true and I said thank god and you said we have two
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   [Laughter]
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   [Laughter]
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.280]   I said
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   I mean both SpaceX
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   and Tesla in 2008 if we'd simply
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   paid our suppliers on time we would have gone bankrupt
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   immediately
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   Tell us actually
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   [Laughter]
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   It was a pretty crazy moment in time because I also
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   remember asking you at we were
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   having dinner at BOA and I said
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   well certainly it's got to be some good news
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   and you took out your Blackberry to date
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   the conversation I don't remember it
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   and you said
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   don't tell anybody Jay Kyle
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   no problem and you showed me the clay version
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   of the Model S
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   the most beautiful car I'd ever seen and I said
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   oh my god it's stunning
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   how much is it going to cost you said I think I can
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   make it for 50,000 I remember it was yesterday
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.280]   I said if you make that car for 50,000 you'll change
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   the fucking world and you did it
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   and I was a little more than 50,000
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   but
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.280]   [Applause]
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   [Applause]
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   Let's ask about SpaceX
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   okay well let's ask about SpaceX but I want to ask
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.280]   one more personal question has life
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   gotten easier for you as these
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   companies have hit scale or
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   has the complexity made life
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   even more challenging because
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   those early days it was just fighting
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   to survive nobody knew who
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   you were you were anonymous
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   and it was really just about the work and now
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   let's face it you're the world's
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   most famous guy
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   and everybody's watching everything you do but these companies
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   are also very big so what's life like
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   for you today are you enjoying what you're
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   doing every day
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   well I mean it's somewhat of a
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   roller coaster so there are like
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   good days and bad days
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   and there's always like crisis issues
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.280]   and you know
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   like sort of you know knock on wood like we're not
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   like
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   facing you know death
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   in the face like it's definitely
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   like quite stressful when like
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   you know death is like trying
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.280]   to eat your face off and like the foam
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   is like you know just getting
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   and like yeah right there
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   you know
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   you know that's
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   it's pretty stressful in that situation
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   so
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.280]   like right you know both
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   SpaceX and Tesla have
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.280]   you know significant cash reserves
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   so like you know it's not
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   we're staring death in the face we can sort of see it over
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   in the horizon you know so I don't want to get complacent
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   or entitled because
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   but if it's not like just
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.280]   sort of foaming at the mouth
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   gnashing trying to eat your face off on a daily
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   basis that's certainly
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   we've moved on from that point
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   and hopefully never
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   return
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   but there are a lot of issues that need to be
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   it's just
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   if you're a CEO of a company
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   the chore level is high and if you don't
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   do your chores then the company goes
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   to hell and I hate doing chores
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   frankly so
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.280]   who does
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   so that's the real
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.280]   like there's a whole bunch of sort of
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.280]   you know personnel issues and legal
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   issues and things that I
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   don't find
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   enjoyable to work on but if I don't work on them
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   the company suffers so it's more
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   like just the sheer
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   volume of work is insane
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   and then
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   go do something go add to it
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   with twitter or something like that
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.280]   yeah I mean honestly
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.280]   extra processor
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   I mean I have a habit
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   of biting off more than I can chew and then just
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   sitting there with like chipmunk cheeks
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   tell us
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.280]   a little bit about
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   where we are at SpaceX like how
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   you fund
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   the ability to go to Mars
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.280]   but then also commercially still build
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   a conventional
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.280]   space business domestically
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   I think this Russia thing was probably
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   really good for SpaceX if you want to just tell us
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   a little bit about that
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   sure
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   well the
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   goal of SpaceX is to develop the technology
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   that enables life to become
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   multi-planetary and
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   make humanity
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   a space faring civilization which I think is
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   a very exciting
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   inspiring thing and it's like some one of those
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   things where you can that I think
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   just makes kids like be excited
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   about the future and
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   we need things that are inspiring
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   and exciting and make the future seem
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   like it's gonna be better than the past
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   life can't just be about solving one miserable problem
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   after another it's got to be like like what's
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   what's inspiring and exciting and I think that
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   a future where we are space faring civilization
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.280]   is one that
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   we can all get excited about
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   and we can go out there
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   and find out what's out there
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   in the universe and what's the meaning of life
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.280]   and where are the aliens and hopefully
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   they're friendly
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   so
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   you know
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.280]   it's interesting I do get asked about the aliens
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   question a lot and I've
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   not seen any evidence of
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   aliens and I'll
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   be the first to you know tweet
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   about it or whatever if I see some
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   I mean you'll tell us if you find them
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   I will definitely tell you
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   if there's aliens
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   and
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   you know I think we're
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   quite helpful for you know
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   like if we found
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   aliens like probably SpaceX will get
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   a ton more revenue because people like oh
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   man aliens we've been upgraded our space technology
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   pronto because what if you're unfriendly
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.280]   you know
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   it's like you know
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   that's quite true
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   is the idea that you build
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   basically the ability
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   to do orbital
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   cargo take all those profits
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   launch Starlink take
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.280]   all those profits and move it all
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.280]   into building something that can get
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   to Mars is that the kind of
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   rough plan
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   pretty much it's if it was like
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   a three step three slide PowerPoint
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.280]   it would be pretty much as you
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   described which is
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   develop rockets that are
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   capable of taking
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   satellites to orbit and
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.280]   crew to the space station
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.280]   basically
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   servicing government commercial space
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   launch needs and then
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   build a global communication
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   system in space that
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   obviously it does a lot of good for Earth
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   by providing internet
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   connectivity to the least
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   served because a satellite system is
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   really great for remote locations
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   and you know countryside
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   or remote islands
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   or places where someone's
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   trying to cut off their internet
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   as a prelude to a war
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   we take them to the system
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.280]   like in Star Wars
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   so it's like you know so it can
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.280]   be pretty helpful like I think
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   like a satellite basically I think is a
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.280]   sort of forceful good in its own right
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.280]   by providing
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   connectivity to
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   the least served where they've got
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   either no connection or a very
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   expensive or poor connection
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   you know
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   like we're connecting a lot of
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.280]   schools remote schools in Brazil
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   right now I'm actually going
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   to be headed there to sort of kick things
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   off but they've got a lot of schools
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.280]   that have no connectivity at all and
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   in a modern age how
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   do you learn with no connectivity
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   I mean you get I guess old textbooks and
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   stuff but it's really
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   you're at a huge disadvantage if you
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   have no digital connectivity
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   so I think there's
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   just a lot of good that Starlink can do
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   in it just by itself but
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   then the revenue generated
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   from Starlink is what can enable
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   the creation of a
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.280]   permanently
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   crude base on the moon
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   which will be the next step from Apollo
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   which is like let's not go there for a few
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   hours and then head back let's have a
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.280]   permanently occupied science
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.280]   station on the moon
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.280]   and we could also build
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   some pretty epic telescopes
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   on the moon
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   that would enable us to learn more about
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   the nature of the universe and figure out what's
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   going on and maybe detect those aliens
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   do you
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   do you think that there's enough profit
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   in those businesses to fund all this
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   or do you need Wall Street
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   and other investors to come share the load
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   with you
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   is going to Mars a partnership with the government
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   does it need to partner with governments to get there
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   well I think technically it does not need to partner with governments
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   but of course government support would be helpful
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.280]   so
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   it's going to be very expensive
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   to build a self-sustaining
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   city on Mars like in order for us to
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   become multi-planetary in a way that's meaningful
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   the key threshold is
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   at which point does the city become
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   self-sustaining such that
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   if the ships from Earth
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.280]   stop coming for any reason
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   it could be any reason, it could be World War 3
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   or it could be just civilization
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.280]   subsided
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   and just gradually got
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.280]   decrepit or something
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.280]   but if the ships stop coming
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.280]   if the resupply ships from Earth
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   stop coming to Mars for any reason
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   does the city still survive
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   and that's like really a large
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.280]   base of resources that are
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.280]   needed on Mars
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   you can't be missing any one
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.280]   critical ingredient
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.280]   and think of this like there are
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   these various great filters
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.280]   that perhaps stop civilizations
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   and one of the
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   great filters is will we become
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   a multi-planet species or not
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   will humanity be one of those
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.280]   species that passes the great
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   filter of going beyond one
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.280]   planet and being a multi-planet species
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.280]   and this is certainly something we will have to do at some point
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   because the sun is expanding
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   and will eventually boil the oceans
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   and destroy all life on Earth
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   so if you care about life on Earth you should really care
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   about life becoming multi-planetary and ultimately
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.280]   multi-stellar because otherwise
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   you're basically saying
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   you're signing the sort of
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   death warrant for all life as we know it
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.280]   it's inevitable
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   and then there's also the various things
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   that kill off the dinosaurs
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.280]   and I mean if you look at the fossil
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   record there have been five major extinctions
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   that are sort of on the order of
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   80-90% of all creatures on Earth
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.280]   dying for a
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   wide range of reasons
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   and then humans
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   can also, you know, with the
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   World War 3 danger
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   that other creatures didn't have
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   where we could do ourselves in
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   by sort of misusing
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.280]   advanced technology and sort of
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   just having some
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   radioactive hell hole that's all that's left
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   after World War 3
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.280]   so you know
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   you could even characterize it potentially
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   as which will come first
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   World War 3 or
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   life becoming multi-planetary
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   on Mars
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   I'm sorry I was going to
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   shift but you know
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   when you think about the importance of going to Mars
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.280]   versus solving
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   critical energy and climate change
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   problems here on Earth obviously the effort with
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   Tesla is related to sustainable energy
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   and I think going back to like
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   probably the 1950s there were engineering designs
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.280]   around plasma fusion
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   or fusion based systems that have evolved to these plasma
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   systems, to these tokamak systems
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   and every year, every decade
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   it's like hey next decade we're going to have it
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   what's your point of view
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   on where plasma fusion
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   systems are? Are we going to have fusion
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   energy
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   this century, this decade
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   and does it create limitless energy
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   where the electricity production goes up
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   by 10,000 fold and the price
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   of electricity drops by 10,000 fold
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   and then what does that world on Earth
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   look like if that happens
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   I guess the question is like is that technology
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.280]   real, when does it happen and what happens
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   to the world here when and
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   if that happens? I'll answer that question
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   but then I'll, let me sort of point
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   out what the actual issue is
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   if the question is like
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   is it possible to solve fusion
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   energy 100%
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   yes, definitely
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   definitely, definitely, definitely, for sure
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.280]   so the
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   and really just using a tokamak
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   style which is like basically a donut
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   ring with
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   electromagnets that control
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   the plasma
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   the way to solve that is simply scale
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   up the tokamak. Fusion is
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.280]   very much a scale
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   based thing. You want
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   to minimize your surface to volume ratio so
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   as you scale up a
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   tokamak you reduce your surface to volume ratio
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.280]   which means like the
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   volume you have relative to
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   the surface
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   you now have much more
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   like you can basically have a hot
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.280]   zone in the center that's relatively far away
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   from the walls and more of
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   a hot zone
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.280]   so
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   it's not in my mind a question
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   as to whether fusion can work
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   but there is a question as to whether
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   it is economically viable
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   and whether it is competitive
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   with alternatives
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   I think the economic viability
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   of fusion is a much
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   bigger question and I think the
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   answer probably is that
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   fusion
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   is not competitive
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   economically. I think that is
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   I would say it's
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   probably not competitive economically by an order of magnitude
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   Is it a
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   materials breakdown or where does it break
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   down?
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   Well, so
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   you can't just
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   use
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   normal hydrogen
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   you need to use like deuterium and tritium
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   like unusual forms of hydrogen
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   helium-3
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   you know
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   there are
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   some other
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   types of fusion that could be used
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   but
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   these are just not
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.280]   there's not a lot of this raw material
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   it's quite difficult to get the raw material
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   so first you have to get the raw material
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   that's expensive raw material
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   and then
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   it's not just about generating
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   the energy you've got to
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   turn that energy
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   into usable electricity
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   you can't just have a hot thing
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   so the hot thing has to translate to
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   usable electricity
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   so I think
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   you've got a cost of fuel
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   issue which is very significant
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   you've got to have a whole bunch of knockdowns
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   from when you generate
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   the heat to when you actually convert
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   that into electricity
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.280]   you've got some very difficult
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.280]   maintenance issues with
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.280]   a fusion reactor
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   so
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   and that should be then compared to alternatives
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   the sustainable energy
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   alternatives that I think are overwhelmingly
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   more competitive are
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.280]   solar energy
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   wind, geothermal
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   hydro, some
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   tidal energy but it's
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   really primarily solar
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   and wind
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   you can really say like
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   why bother creating
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   fusion on earth when we have a gigantic
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   fusion reactor in the sky that
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.280]   just works with zero maintenance
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   and it shows up every day
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   and it's pretty consistent
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   but Elon can we scale to
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.280]   1000x or 100x our electricity
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   production here using solar
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.280]   and other renewable sources
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.280]   yes so
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   the amount of surface area you need
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   to power the United States
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   is remarkably tiny
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   so you need like basically
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   roughly 100 miles by
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   100 miles of territory and it
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   obviously doesn't need to be in one place
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   in the United States to power the United States
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   it's like a little corner of Texas
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   or Utah, the entire country
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   and then
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   if you
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   you could basically power
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   you probably 10x
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   just with solar alone
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.280]   without displacing
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.280]   anyone's home
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   power and economy 10 times the size of the United States
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   in the United States, on land
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   when energy prices
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.280]   if you extend that to water
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   because earth is 70% water
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.280]   I mean you could
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.280]   say okay now we could probably have
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   a civilization that is
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   100 times as energy intensive
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   as we currently have it. So what does that look
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   like was the last part of my question which is
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   a world where energy costs are say like 100
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   times cheaper than they are today and we have 100 times
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   more energy production capacity
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   what changes about civilization
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   what do we do differently and what do we see
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.280]   change most kind of
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   dramatically? Well
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   currently we're not
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.280]   because of just generally
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   low birth rates almost worldwide
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   civilization
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.280]   is not headed to
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   have a population
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   that is an order of magnitude greater than
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   where we're currently headed towards
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.280]   a population decline
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   and this is almost everywhere
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   in the world
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   so
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   it basically seems
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.280]   as though as soon as you have like
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.280]   urbanization and
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.280]   education beyond a certain level
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   and income beyond a certain level, birth rates plummet
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.280]   and so
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   as countries get wealthier
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.280]   their birth rates plummet. It's somewhat counterintuitive
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   people will say like well it's too expensive
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   to have a baby. Nope, the wealthier
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   you are the fewer kids you have
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   the more educated you are the fewer
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   kids you have so
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   it's
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   the inverse
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.280]   so I'm not sure
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   who would use all that energy
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.280]   unless there's a significant change in the birth
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.280]   rate or we have
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   a very robot
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   oriented economy. So that's also possible
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.280]   so if we've got a lot of
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   you know four wheeled robots
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   in form of cars and
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.280]   androids, humanoid
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   robots, then you can certainly
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   see that there'd be perhaps
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   a need for an order of magnitude more energy
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   but it's not coming from the
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   humans unless something
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   major changes on the human
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   birth rate level
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   this by the way is I think the biggest single threat
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   to civilization right now
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   is the... Why do you think societally
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   people just make those decisions when
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   they become more affluent? Is it that they just become
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   more selfish or there's more
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   things for them to do and they have more money to spend
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   on themselves and they say you know what
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   I don't want to have a large
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.280]   family I want to you know go to
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   Coachella
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   Yeah well
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   there is this like weird like
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   mind virus-y thing where some people
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   are they think like having fewer kids
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.280]   is like better for the environment
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   Yeah that's crazy. This is total nonsense
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.280]   The environment is going to be fine
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   They're going to be fine even if we
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   doubled the size of the humans
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   and I know a lot about environmental
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.280]   stuff so you know
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.280]   we can't have
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.280]   civilization just dwindle into
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   nothing and
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   you know Japan's leading indicator here
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   like the Japan's population
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   declined by 600,000 people last year
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   They had the lowest birth rate in history
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   It's you know it's pretty bad
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   So
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   I don't know
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   I think
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   so
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   one element of it is
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   a lot of people just think that having kids
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.280]   is somehow bad for the environment. I want to be clear
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   it's not. It's essential for
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   maintaining civilization that we at least maintain
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   our numbers. We don't necessarily need to grow
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   dramatically but at least
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   let's not you know gradually
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   dwindle away until
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   civilization ends with us
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   all in adult diapers
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   and a whimper. Like we don't want
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   civilization to end in adult diapers
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.280]   with a whimper. That would suck
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.280]   Kind of suck yeah
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   Bleak and sad
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.280]   Well I mean and you and I have had this conversation
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   I mean in Japan I had two people tell me
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   when I was there like I think
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   it's immoral to bring humans into
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.280]   the world. I mean people have gotten very
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   sad about the future
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.280]   It's kind of crazy. The world's
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   great. Life's awesome
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.280]   Yes. No
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.280]   there's literally I've heard many times
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   like how can I bring a child into this terrible world
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   I'm like have you read history
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   because let me tell you it was way worse back then
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   Okay. Yeah
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   Now's a good time
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   Now's a good time to be bored
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   Hey you know listen I know you're super busy
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.280]   but I wanted to ask you about the move to Texas
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.280]   because I've been thinking about it
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   Austin. California
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   I don't know some senator told you to go fuck yourself
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   and like you know
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   I think it's been a couple senators
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.280]   that actually
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   It seems to be turning into a bit of a trend
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   but how has
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   building the Tesla
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   Gigafactory
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.280]   which I got to see in Austin a couple weeks
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.280]   ago and it was one of the most
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.280]   inspiring things I've ever seen I mean
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   I don't know how many
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.280]   months it took to build there but
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   how long did it take to build that
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.280]   dreadnought and then
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   what would have taken to build that
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   in California under
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.280]   Gavin Newsom? So we
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   built the
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   Gigatexas which is the biggest
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   factory in North America I think possibly the biggest
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   factory in the world
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   and it's three times the size of the pentagon
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   to give you a sense of scale. Okay.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   This is friggin big. It's like
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   it's weird. It's like so big it's weird.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   I was trying to find
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   you in it and I was trying to
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   drive around and it took me about 45
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   minutes to find you. Yeah
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   like no you have to like call so you can't
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   find someone in the building you have to call them on their cell phone
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   and say where are you you know.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   So I mean the building is like
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   just under a mile
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   long and we're actually going to extend it it will be like
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   literally a mile long and
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   about a quarter mile wide
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   and it's 80 feet
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   tall so it's
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   just ridiculously big
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.280]   and when you
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.280]   think about it like for manufacturing situation
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   like what are the
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   two things that really define manufacturing
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   competitiveness are economies of scale
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   and technology
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   and so if you got an ace on economy
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   like if you sort of maximize your
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   ace level on technology
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   and you maximize your ace level on scale
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   this is obviously going to be the most competitive
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   situation and that's why they're so friggin giant
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   and
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   the giga Texas
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   will go all the way from
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.280]   cell raw materials like
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.280]   basically rail cars of cell raw materials
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   coming in and then forming the battery
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   cell then the battery pack
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   building the motor
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   casting we're also
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   have introduced a major innovation which
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   is to cast the entire front
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   third and rear third of the car as a
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   single piece. I got this idea
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   from toys actually because I was like how do they make toys
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.280]   those are cheap they just cast them
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   I was like well can you pull the casting machine
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   that big and they're like well no
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.280]   one ever has I'm like is it are we breaking physics
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   like no well let's just ask them
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.280]   and there were six major casting machine
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.280]   suppliers in the world and five of them said no
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   and the six said maybe I'm like I'll take that as a yes
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   [Laughter]
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.280]   Well I mean you wanted to do this for
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   the model three but it was just too soon huh
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   and now it's almost
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   there. Actually this
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   partly comes from the model three which is
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   actually a fantastic car in many ways
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   but we were rightly criticized
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   for an inefficient design
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   for the front and rear
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   body like
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Sandy Monroe who I think is really
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   has excellent from an engineering
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   standpoint and really a very fair
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   critic
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.280]   he pistol whupped us for
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   the design of the battery
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.280]   He ripped it apart and piece by
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.280]   piece told you why you suck and then
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.280]   he did the why and told you why you were awesome
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.280]   He took it apart and told
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.280]   us exactly why we sucked and
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.280]   he was correct and then
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.280]   and I was like well that's
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   pretty embarrassing so
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.280]   he was complimentary of other parts of the car
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.280]   not the body design and
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   so it's like okay we're going to go from
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.280]   like you know
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.280]   it's just an incredibly
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.280]   difficult body to make. It's made out of like
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.280]   120 different pieces with dissimilar metals
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   that are joined and you've got galvanic
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   corrosion challenges. It's very
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   difficult to make. To a single piece
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   casting that's one piece so like
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   120 pieces went down to like one
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   so
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   it's a huge
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   and the model
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   Y body shop especially the new one where we cast
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   both the front and rear is 60%
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   smaller than the model 3 body shop
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.280]   so it's you know gigantic
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.280]   it's quite a lot of innovations
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   of Tesla besides the stuff that is
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.280]   obvious
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   so anyway so yeah
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.280]   and really
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   you know to refer
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   to Gavin Newsome like
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.280]   you know
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.280]   if you
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.280]   had a gun to Gavin's head
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.280]   and said we need to
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   start building this factory in California right
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   now he couldn't do it because
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   there are so many regulatory
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   agencies
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   and so many litigators
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.280]   in California that want to stop you from doing
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.280]   anything that even if you're the
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   governor of the state you cannot
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   get it done
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   so something's got to be done
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   to
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   because California used to be
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   a land of opportunity and
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   it's a beautiful state and I loved
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   living there I still spend a lot of time
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   in California even though every time I go there
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   I get literally every day I
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   go there I get the Jesus tax
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   tax bill by day
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.280]   cost per day of me going and working
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280]   in California today boggles the mind and I still
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   do it you know
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   but the California's gone from land of
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   opportunity to the land
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.280]   of
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   sort of taxes
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   over regulation and litigation
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   and this is not a
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.280]   good situation and really there's got to
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   be like a serious
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   cleaning out of the pipes in California how many months
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   was it to get the gig
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.280]   at Austin done took a year and
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   a half two years yeah 18
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.280]   months to build something three times the size of the Pentagon
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.280]   incredible and you just
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   basically the answer to how many months it would
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   take in California's infinity
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   we would still be working on the permits
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   yeah
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   this begs a good question
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   which is
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.280]   I'm not exaggerating
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   can you keep signing paperwork
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.280]   we have one more form for you
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   what's a better model
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   what's a better model for government
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280]   so you know like all governments tend to
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   increase in complexity
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.280]   dictatorship capacity
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.280]   is the dictatorship the right model
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.280]   and
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.280]   you know like how do we solve this let's say you go to
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   Mars or let's say you have to fix California is California
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   permanently broken is there
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.280]   a way to fix it or like how do you set up a better model
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   so that you don't end up having this
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.280]   this kind of special interest complexity
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.280]   situation that eventually kills
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.280]   the population
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.280]   I mean I think ultimately with California
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   the people of California just have to get fed up
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   and demand change
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.280]   that's the thing that really has to happen
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   and there's
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   got to be an above 0% chance
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.280]   of the Republicans
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   winning in California if
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.280]   it's just the Democrats every time
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   it's got to be
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   and this is like occasionally
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   the thing is
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.280]   that right now
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.280]   plus the level
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   of gerrymandering
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   which is basically just treating the people
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   like sheep and
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   it's terrible
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.280]   that's gone on in California is outrageous
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.280]   so California the Dems
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.280]   have a super majority
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   in the House and Senate in California
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   and the governor and everything
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   how responsive is any political party
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   going to be to the people if they are
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   guaranteed to win
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   it's a one party state
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   I'm not saying
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280]   that you know
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   sort of elect the Republicans
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   every time but if it's never
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.280]   you're just making California a one
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   party state they will no longer be responsive
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   to the people and will only be responsive
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280]   to those that funded their political campaigns
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.280]   clip Elon saying that 30 seconds on
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   TV over and over go ahead
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.280]   so Elon shifting gears to
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280]   the economy you know we saw
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   this surprise report of
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   negative 1.4% GDP
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.280]   growth in Q1
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280]   interest rates been rising that increased the
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.280]   cost to the consumer of getting loans things like
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.280]   that we've had a stock market
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.280]   correction really a crash in
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.280]   a lot of growth stocks software stocks
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.280]   from where
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   you sit and the data that you see
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.280]   where do you think the economy
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   is headed right now do you think we're
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.280]   in a recession or is it just a risk
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.280]   how do you how do you assess our current
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   economic situation well predicting economic
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.280]   macroeconomics is always difficult
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.280]   and one should assign probabilities to these
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.280]   things but ironically
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.280]   I did last year people asked me
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.280]   what I think about the economy I said well I think we might
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.280]   enter a recession in approximately
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.280]   spring
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   of 2020 of
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.280]   2022
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   called it nailed it
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   yeah
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.280]   so
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   the thing is that recessions are not
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   necessarily a bad thing
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.280]   they you know
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.280]   what I've not
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   been through a few of them and what has
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   happened is if you have
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.280]   a boom that goes on for too long
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   you get misallocation of capital
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.280]   it starts raining money on fools
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.280]   basically it's like any dumb
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   thing gets money and I'm sure you've seen a few of those
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.280]   so
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   at some point it gets
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   just out of control and you just have a misallocation
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.280]   of human capital
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.280]   where people are doing things that are silly
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   and not useful to their fellow human beings
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.280]   and then those companies
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.280]   there needs to be sort of an economic enema
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   if you will
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   to have everyone sort of shift
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   uncomfortably in their seats
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280]   so
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   but the
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   sorry it's just I'm visualizing it
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.280]   the economic
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.280]   enema I mean listen it's got
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   alliteration
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.280]   so
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   this too
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   shall pass
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   eventually the economic enema
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   does its job
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   clears out the pipes if you will
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   yes
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   and sort of the
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   bullshit companies
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   go bankrupt and the ones that
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   are doing useful products
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   are prosperous
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.280]   but there's certainly a lesson here
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   that if one is making useful product
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.280]   and has a company that makes sense
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   make sure you're not running things too
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.280]   close to the edge from a capital standpoint
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   that you've got some capital reserves to
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.280]   last through irrational
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   times because in the past when there's
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.280]   been a recession
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   it's amazing it's flipped like a light switch
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.280]   I mean David do you remember this from
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   the PayPal, you know ex-PayPal days
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   when we
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   raised a hundred million dollars in March of
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   2000 and we literally
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   we had the
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   demand was so high we had
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.280]   people like
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   VCs like just literally without even a
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.280]   term sheet wiring money into our
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.280]   account
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.280]   we'll send the term sheet later
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   they literally were like sleuth out
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.280]   our bank account number and wire
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.280]   money in and we're like where'd this come from
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.280]   and it's like oh
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   so
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   it was like they were just literally
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.280]   raising money in March of 2000
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   and then in April 2000
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.280]   the market went into free fall and it went
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   from money, raising money was trivial
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   to even good companies could not raise money
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.280]   in a month
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.280]   so it's just important to
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.280]   bear in mind like that you know PayPal
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   almost went bankrupt in 2000
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   we came close
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   but thankfully we'd
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   raised that hundred million dollars in March
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   2000 without which we'd
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   be game over basically
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.280]   and we
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.280]   kind of saw it coming so it's like we
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.280]   got that the X
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   confinity merger done in like three weeks
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.280]   and raised a hundred million dollars
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.280]   because we were all like uh oh
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   we see this coming to an end pretty
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.280]   soon and then a month later it was like
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.280]   you know a nightmare basically
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   and
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.280]   so it's just important to
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   make sure if you're a healthy company you got some capital
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   to get through things
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   and then what's your
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   loss and if
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   it is a recession which
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   more likely than not it is a recession
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.280]   I'm not saying it is but it probably
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   is then
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   just
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   watch your cash flow and get to
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   positive cash flow as soon as you can
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   so
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   yeah
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   but I think we probably
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.280]   are
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   in a recession and that
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   recession will get worse
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.280]   but you know these
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.280]   things pass and then there will be boom times
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   again so it'll
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.280]   probably be some tough going
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   for I don't know a year
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   maybe
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.280]   12 to 18 months is usually
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.280]   the amount
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   of time that takes for a
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.280]   correction to happen
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   what do you
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   guys think?
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   David how do you feel about it?
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.280]   Yeah I mean it feels like it started
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   you know what started as a slowdown
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.280]   earlier this year now
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   seems like I mean technically I guess we need
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   two quarters of negative growth to be in a recession but it
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.280]   feels like we're in one. Feels like it started
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.280]   you know the
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   growth stock the software businesses that we invest in are
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.280]   sort of the canaries in the coal mine
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.280]   and there's a lot of dead canaries
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   not dead but
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   having a hard time breathing?
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   How much do you get?
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280]   It's not
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   dead it's just napping
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.280]   It's napping
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   Wake up little birdie
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   Wake up
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.280]   It's just high
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   It's just stunned
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.280]   It got stunned for a brief moment
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.280]   and it'll be fine
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   It sort of reminds me of the parrot
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.280]   you know the Pet Shop sketch with the parrot
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.280]   with Monty Python
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   It's pining
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.280]   this parrot is pining for the fjords
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   Hey Elon
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   a lot has been talked about as we wrap here
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.280]   and you've been incredibly gracious giving us so much
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   time thank you for that
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   a lot of talk about American
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.280]   exceptionalism over the last couple of years
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.280]   waning
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   and maybe this country had seen
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.280]   its best days and
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.280]   we see the work you're doing and other people
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.280]   in this great country are doing and the
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   debates we're having about the future
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   and yeah China's doing
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.280]   pretty fantastic Russia's on the ropes
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   but it does
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   seem like America
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   is still producing some
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.280]   of the greatest companies
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   the world has ever seen some of the greatest innovations
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   what are your thoughts on
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.280]   America and our future and what we need
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.280]   to keep this country
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.280]   and this beacon of hope that
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.280]   you know four of the five of us
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.280]   were not born here you know two of you came from
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   South Africa and no three of you
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   three of you came from South Africa one of you from Canada
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   I don't know what they're putting in the law from Sri Lanka and from Sri Lanka
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   and through Canada via Canada
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.280]   he came through Canada too
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   yeah I know it seems
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.280]   like that's the way Canada is a gateway
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.280]   it is a gateway
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.280]   how do we
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.280]   well I'm hinting at the answer here but
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.280]   you know it does seem like our immigration
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   policy is absolutely insane
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   and maybe
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.280]   we need to keep collecting
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.280]   some of the great individuals that I get
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.280]   to share the stage with here and yourself
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.280]   we need to keep bringing great people to this country
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.280]   why can't we get that
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.280]   in our heads that
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.280]   yeah it's not immigration it's talent recruitment
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.280]   no absolutely
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   I think it's incredibly important
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.280]   that the United States be
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   the destination for the world's best talent
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280]   I mean you can think of this like
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.280]   a pro sports team if you want to win the league
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   and
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.280]   you know you want the best players in your team
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280]   now there are obviously
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.280]   a lot of very
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   talented people born in the United States
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.280]   but if you can add a few aces
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.280]   from
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.280]   outside the country to the team
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.280]   you're going to win the league
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.280]   and here's the thing those aces
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.280]   actually want to work for your team
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.280]   they don't want to compete against you
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.280]   they want to be on Team America
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280]   and so it's like
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.280]   we have to like fight them off
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.280]   to not be on Team America
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   that's the crazy thing
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   and so it's like if you have some aces
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.280]   that are the difference between winning and losing
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.280]   we should be like really
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.280]   recruiting them like you'd recruit
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   a star basketball
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.280]   player or football player that's what
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.280]   we should be doing
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   active recruiting
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.280]   just like if you're a company that wants to succeed
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.280]   you actively recruit the best talent
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.280]   and that's
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.280]   the way to win and
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   if that stops happening America will stop winning
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.280]   and we have two
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   administrations in a row
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.280]   Biden and Trump who don't want to
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   let the greatest minds
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.280]   the most talented people into this country
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280]   it's absolutely insane
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.280]   you deal with this every day
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.280]   reality is like
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   anyone who wants
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.280]   to work hard and
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.280]   do useful things
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.280]   and we
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.280]   want in the United States
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   and it's not just people
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.280]   who are sort of intellectually strong but it's
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.280]   just anyone with a strong
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   work ethic
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   if they're coming from Mexico
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   or if they're coming from
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.280]   Europe or China or wherever
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280]   if they're going to come here and crank hard
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   and contribute more than they
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.280]   take, hell yeah
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.280]   that's just a no brainer
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280]   Have you been
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.280]   disappointed in the
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.280]   similarities between Biden and Trump
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   on this? Maybe you could have
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.280]   expected it from Trump because that was the rhetoric he
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.280]   needed to use to get elected but it's
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.280]   not as if Biden has flipped the script and said
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.280]   we're going to go 180 degrees in the other direction
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   he's kind of kept it the same
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280]   which has been really surprising actually
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.280]   Man, it's hard to tell what Biden is doing
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   if you're totally frank
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.280]   [laughter]
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.280]   [applause]
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   It's weekend at Bernie's
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   The real
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.280]   president is whoever controls
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.280]   the teleprompter
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   it's like
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   the path to power is the path to the teleprompter
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.280]   because
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.280]   then he just reads the teleprompter
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.280]   so I do feel like
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   if somebody would accidentally
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280]   lean on the teleprompter, it's going to be like
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.280]   Anchorman, it's going to be like
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.280]   QQQ ASDF 123
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.280]   type of thing
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.280]   [laughter]
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280]   In fairness to Biden, he hasn't been
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.280]   napping as much as he needs to but
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.280]   [laughter]
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.280]   It's an incredibly hard job
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.280]   getting done
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   this administration, it doesn't seem to
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.280]   get a lot done
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.280]   and whatever
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.280]   the Trump administration
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.280]   leaving Trump aside
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   there were a lot of people in the administration
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   who were effective at getting things done
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.280]   so
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.280]   this administration seems
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.280]   to not have the drive to just
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.280]   get shit done
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   that's my impression
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   so
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.280]   um
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.280]   we definitely
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   need to fix immigration policy, we had COVID
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   which was an issue and so that was
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.280]   one reason to
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.280]   clamp down on it
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.280]   but now we've moved on
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   so let's just make sure we're getting
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.280]   top talent in the United States
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.280]   and really I'd say
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.280]   broadly it's anyone
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   who wants to work their ass off
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   and
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   contribute more than they take to the economy
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   that's just necessarily going to make
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.280]   for a stronger, better society
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.280]   in America. Elon, did you see
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   Jeff's,
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.280]   Bezos' tweet back and forth
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.280]   with Biden, where Biden
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.280]   I think was talking about inflation
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.280]   but then he correlated that to taxing
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.280]   corporations and Bezos said
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.280]   this is misinformation and disinformation, etc.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.280]   etc. What did you think about that whole exchange
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   then, back and forth?
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   The obvious reason for inflation is
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   that the government printed a zillion amount of
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   more money than it had, obviously
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   so it's like
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.280]   the government can't just
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   have
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.280]   issued checks for
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.280]   an excessive revenue without there being
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.280]   inflation. Velocity
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.280]   of money held constant, so unless there's something
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.280]   that would change with velocity of money
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   but it's just
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   if the federal government writes checks, they never
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   bounce, so that is effectively creation
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   of more dollars
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   and if there are more dollars created
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   then increasing the goods and services
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.280]   output of the economy, then you have inflation.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.280]   Again, velocity of money held constant.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   This is very basic.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   This is not like
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.280]   super complicated.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   If the
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.280]   government could just issue
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   massive amounts of money and
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.280]   deficits didn't matter,
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.280]   then why don't we just make the deficit 100 times
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   bigger?
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.280]   The answer is you can't because
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.280]   it will basically turn the dollar
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.280]   into something that is worthless.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.280]   Various countries have tried
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.280]   this experiment multiple times. It's not like
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   "Oh, I wonder what happens if
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   this is done." Have you seen
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   Venezuela? The poor
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.280]   people of Venezuela
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.280]   have been just run roughshod
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.280]   by their government.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   Obviously, you can't
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.280]   simply create money.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.280]   The true economy, it's
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.280]   important. The true economy is the output
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.280]   of goods and services. It's not money.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.280]   What is the output of goods and services?
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.280]   Money is simply a way
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.280]   for us to
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.280]   or anything that you call money
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.280]   is a way for us to conveniently
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.280]   exchange goods and services without having to
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.280]   engage in barter and also to shift
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.280]   obligations and time.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   Those are the two reasons that you have money.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.280]   This thing called money.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.280]   It's a database.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.280]   It's an information system
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.280]   for labor allocation
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.280]   and for exchange of goods and services
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.280]   and for translating in time.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   The quality of that information
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   is a function of...
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280]   Basically, you can apply information theory to money.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   I think it
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.280]   helps explain why
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.280]   one money system is...
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.280]   why one action is better than another.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.280]   If like...
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.280]   Just like
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.280]   an internet connection, you'd want something
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.280]   that has high bandwidth,
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.280]   low latency and jitter,
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.280]   and is not dropping packets,
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.280]   does not have a lot of errors in the system.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.280]   The same is true
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.280]   of money.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.280]   Really, like you said,
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.280]   what did PayPal really do?
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.280]   It helped improve
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.280]   the bandwidth, the speed at which
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.280]   money could move. Instead
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.280]   of mailing checks back and forth,
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.280]   which amazingly that was what people did
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.280]   in 2000,
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.280]   you could now do
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.280]   real-time exchange of
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.280]   money and
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.280]   now you could ship your goods immediately, instead
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.280]   of mailing a check and waiting for the bank
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.280]   to clear the check.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.280]   The
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.280]   ultimate thing with PayPal,
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.280]   or if it was in the X.com,
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.280]   less niche
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.280]   payments, more broad financial would be
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.280]   to simply... It doesn't
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   mediate all the heterogeneous
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.280]   COBOL databases out there running on mainframes
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.280]   doing batch processing and have
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.280]   a single real-time system
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.280]   that was
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.280]   secure and not
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.280]   batch processing.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   It would
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.280]   just be from an information standpoint
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.280]   more efficient and eventually
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.280]   all the
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.280]   batch processing COBOL mainframes operated by the
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   banks would cease to exist.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   You've spent more time
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.280]   and built more in China
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.280]   than almost anybody.
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.280]   I mean, Apple would be the only company I could
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   think of that's probably got a bigger footprint
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   but I'm not certain of that.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.280]   What have you learned about China
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280]   that you didn't know before you opened the factories
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.280]   there and started delivering cars there?
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.280]   What should we know about
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.280]   China as Americans?
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.280]   How should we think about China and our relationship
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.280]   with it? Because we haven't spent time there.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.280]   Sure.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.280]   China, first of all, is not monolithic.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.280]   It's not like... Everything is
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.280]   not some plot by the Chinese government.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:43.280]   There are many factions within China that compete vigorously within China.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   Perhaps most important is that there's just a tremendous number of hardworking, smart people in China
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   who want to get ahead and get things done.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   They're not complacent.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   They're not entitled.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.280]   They want to get things done
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.280]   and they want to make a better life for themselves.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   What we're going to see
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   with China
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.280]   for the first time that anyone can remember
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.280]   who is alive is an economy
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.280]   that is twice the size of the US,
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   possibly three times the size of the US.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.280]   It's going to be very weird living in that world.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   We better stop the infighting in the US
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   and stop punching ourselves in the face
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.280]   because there's way too much
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   of America punching itself in the damn face.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   It's just dumb.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   Think about, "Hey, we've got to be competitive here
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.280]   and there's a new kid on the block
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   that's going to be two to three times our size.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   We better step up our game
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   and stop infighting."
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   Do you think it's easier to stop infighting once we're beaten
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   or do you think that there's a way folks here can actually just get their political and commercial act together?
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:03.280]   Or does it not happen until we realize we've lost?
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.280]   Or do we need a war?
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:09.280]   I sure hope we don't need a war.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:17.280]   There will be certainly an economic competition
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.280]   that I think will blow people away
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   when they realize just how competitive they have to be
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.280]   to be competitive with companies in China.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.280]   It's very difficult.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   Tesla is competitive because we have an awesome team in China.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.280]   Do your Tesla China employees work some meaningful percentage more or harder
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.280]   than your Tesla non-China employees?
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.280]   Do you find it's two different companies, basically?
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:55.280]   I think Tesla is pretty far out there in terms of work ethic anywhere in the world.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:03.280]   The Tesla work ethic in the U.S. I think is substantially greater than any other car company
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   or any large manufacturing company that I'm aware of.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:15.280]   Tesla does have a strong work ethic in the U.S.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:27.280]   But to be totally frank, the work ethic is exceeded on balance by the Tesla China team.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.280]   That is, I think, objectively true.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.280]   So, there's not to say there aren't lots of hardworking people at Tesla U.S.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280]   There certainly are.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.280]   But if you say on average, the work ethic in China is higher.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.280]   It's just we're calling it like it is.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.280]   What about if you're an American CEO?
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:51.280]   How do you deal with, do you think, just the need for managing all these political factions
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   inside of a company?
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   You probably saw all the Sturm und Drang related to Disney and what happened to them
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   and what's continuing to happen to them on both sides between their employees
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.280]   as well as the governments, etc.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   Do you have any advice or what do you tell young CEOs that you hang out with
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.280]   about how to deal with that, how to make those decisions, where you land
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.280]   in the spectrum of dealing with all of this stuff?
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   The non-work issues that are related to now going to work every day.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:25.280]   I'm not sure I entirely understand what you mean.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.280]   Whether it's the need for political correctness or the need for having political points of view
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.280]   and having to bring that and balance that in the workplace, how do you deal with that?
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.280]   How do you give advice to other folks about having to deal with it?
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:42.280]   Look, I think the point of a company is to produce useful products and services
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.280]   for your fellow human beings.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.280]   It is not some political gathering place or a thing where…
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.280]   That's the point of a company.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.280]   I'd say politics and other stuff should…
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:58.280]   [Applause]
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.280]   Let's not lose sight of why companies should exist.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.280]   [Laughter]
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.280]   I'm actually late for speaking.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.280]   I've got to work on the rocket, guys.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   [Laughter]
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   We're going to go ahead and let you get to Mars.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.280]   I'll see you soon.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, Elon Musk.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.280]   [Applause]
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280]   Nicely done, John.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280]   [Music]
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.280]   Rain Man, David Saks.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.280]   [Music]
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.280]   And it said we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.280]   Love you, Westies.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280]   I'm the queen of quinoa.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.280]   I'm going all in.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   Let your winners ride.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.280]   Let your winners ride.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   I'm going all in.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   Besties are gone.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   I hope they're deep.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280]   Saks.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.280]   [Laughter]
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.280]   Oh, man.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   My avid asher will meet me at…
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.280]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.280]   It's like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.280]   Wet your beef.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.280]   Wet your beef.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.280]   Beef.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.280]   We need to get merch.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.280]   Besties are gone.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280]   I'm going all in.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:15.280]   [Music]
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280]   I'm going all in.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280]   [Music]
