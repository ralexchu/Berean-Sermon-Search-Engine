[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:25.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:28.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:35.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:13.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:18.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:24.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:31.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:41.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:53.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:24.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:44.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:02:00.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:29.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.620]   - Is it coming?
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.620]   Oh, sorry about that.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.620]   All right.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.620]   I wanna encourage those of you guys who are in the rooms
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.620]   to make your way on into the main meeting area
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.620]   so that we can do our review.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.780]   (audience chattering)
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.940]   (audience chattering)
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.100]   (audience chattering)
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.260]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.420]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:28.580]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.740]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.900]   (audience chattering)
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:04:18.580]   Okay.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   All right.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.900]   (audience chattering)
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:29.740]   All right, if you would, please take a moment
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.900]   to join with me in a word of prayer,
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.060]   and then we'll start the review portion.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.060]   Let's pray together.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:41.020]   Our God and Father, we take a brief moment
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:45.540]   to request, God, that you would grow our faith.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:51.580]   Lord, we pray that you would do such a spiritual work,
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.260]   God, that every time your word is opened up to our eyes,
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.940]   and God, every time we can hear the scripture,
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.140]   Lord, that you would help us to both understand,
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.580]   gain insight, feel the conviction,
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   just really lay down all of our lives
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.540]   and be open to the scrutiny of your truth
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:15.180]   so that, God, we'd be able to put off that which is earthly
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:19.420]   and continue, Lord, to pursue after the image of Christ.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.140]   We pray for that kind of spiritual blessing in our life,
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.940]   Lord, that the fruit of your word will take its effect,
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.060]   and, God, we would see the character
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.260]   that you long to see, Lord.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.740]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:36.740]   Okay, so, you know, by way of review,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:42.580]   it is to us Christian maturity
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   to be able to tell the difference,
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.100]   and what I mean by that is for us to have our senses
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.660]   so refined by the word of God
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.920]   that we can see that which is earthly, fleshly, carnal,
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.820]   and just even what the world may presume neutral,
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:04.020]   but still, nevertheless, just temporary, right,
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.140]   here on Earth, like that kind of stuff,
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.220]   versus the things of the spirit of God,
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.180]   that we wanna be able to sense that which is heavenly,
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.900]   that which is spirit-wrought, right,
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.460]   because in many ways, two people can do the exact same thing.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.780]   They can work hard at planning an event.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.260]   They can work hard at even teaching.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.700]   They can work hard here at the church,
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.980]   but there is a huge difference
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.620]   between he who is working by the inspiration,
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.340]   the motivation that comes from Christ
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.340]   and a relationship with him, walking in the spirit,
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.600]   versus one who is just doing the deed,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.480]   and so the scripture had for us this admonition
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.820]   that every single one of us walk by the spirit of God,
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.300]   and then after commanding us to do so,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.420]   he was giving us various, very specific things
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.700]   that are indicative of the spirit
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.740]   versus indicative of the flesh,
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.060]   and then at the beginning of this chapter,
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.860]   he gave us the exhortations of how to deal with one another
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.300]   and to say that we ought to restore really gently
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.260]   those who are spiritual,
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.340]   if we are spiritual, that we should do that,
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.180]   and the letter B,
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.780]   that we should bear the burdens of one another,
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.740]   and then, by way of humility,
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.780]   be open to the scrutiny of the scriptures
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.860]   that we would examine ourselves.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.460]   The passage that we have today
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.180]   is a continuation of the thoughts
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.940]   of the fruits of the spirit
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.620]   telling us that we should share all good things
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.920]   and to persevere in doing good, amen?
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.240]   So have those things in mind
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.280]   that there is these commands in there for us to do.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:38.000]   Within this passage that we have for today, then,
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.900]   I would say that there are three distinct sections.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.440]   Doesn't have to be seen this way,
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.400]   but verse six, there is this concept here
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.720]   that the one who is taught
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.640]   on the receiving end of ministry
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.440]   should share all good things,
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.520]   so that's a first principle
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.340]   that being filled with the spirit
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.560]   has this element of reciprocating the blessing you receive,
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.180]   and then, verse seven through eight,
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.920]   clearly shows us this other operating principle
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.240]   which is in the realm of God,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.840]   where God says that whatever a man sows,
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.220]   this he will reap, okay?
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.880]   And then he talks about how if you sow to the flesh,
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.320]   there you will reap from the flesh corruption,
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.280]   and if you sow to the spirit,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.080]   you will reap from the spirit eternal life.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.640]   Then, in verse nine through 10,
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   we have this exhortation and command
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.160]   to not lose heart, to not grow weary,
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.440]   but to persevere in doing good.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.300]   So, as a brief just kind of snapshot of the paragraph,
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.140]   this is the way I broke it down,
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.340]   and I hope it matches perhaps all the work
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:44.140]   that you guys have done in preparation for this lesson.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.260]   And so, here we are in part one,
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.820]   where we look at the general principle, okay?
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.820]   And I will tell you honestly, looking at this passage,
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.760]   I started giggling as I was preparing for this lesson,
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.380]   because, you know, it sounds so self-serving,
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.640]   so I'm just gonna say it from the get-go.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.820]   After the lesson, I will walk around your table
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.280]   and tax your snacks, okay?
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.100]   (laughing)
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.700]   Especially the ones over there,
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:12.340]   and Richard's in the back, okay?
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:15.020]   I mean, obviously, this is kind of interesting
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.020]   to think about, but the whole idea is,
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.900]   what is, we have to ask the question, okay,
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.560]   like, is this just a random thought he had, you know?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.020]   And because there was a lot of sarcasm,
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.820]   and Apostle Paul's like, dude, the more I love you,
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.100]   I mean, am I being hated more now,
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.660]   because I'm coming after you, I'm pursuing you?
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.540]   Am I to be hated, you know?
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.900]   Is he like, remember? (laughing)
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:39.720]   Is he having that sentiment still?
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.300]   What is he expecting?
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.380]   But again, my thought is, not making too much of it,
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.620]   but in the vein of being a spiritual person,
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.460]   if you're a thankless person,
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.600]   I don't think you're a spirit-filled person, right?
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.400]   You have no appreciation for the people,
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.740]   but rather, you have such an entitled mentality,
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.860]   it's like, you know, the people,
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.980]   especially young children who look at their parents,
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.620]   like, of course, parents are supposed to sacrifice, right?
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.180]   As soon as they gain their independence,
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.100]   the parents are so far behind them
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.980]   that they don't even give them a second thought.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.460]   If you have been blessed, the spiritual model typically is,
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.060]   you should be an incredible blessing, right?
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.980]   The thought here is, the general principle is,
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.640]   that the one who is receiving ministry
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:30.080]   is expected to respond with an open-heartedness,
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.460]   with also a reciprocating generosity, right?
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.840]   And obviously, this passage has been really,
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.320]   really misapplied by the prosperity gospel people.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.260]   It's like, show me the money.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:45.400]   You gotta share with me the good things.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.980]   I'm sure you guys sat there,
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.200]   oh, thank you for laughing, I'm not gonna joke.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.680]   But you know, I'm sure you guys sat there
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.480]   and wondered, like, what are the good things, you know?
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.080]   I don't think, obviously, he's thinking about one thing.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.200]   Why?
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Because in the text, the idea for share is really broad,
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.320]   okay, is really broad.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.440]   The term for share is essentially the verb form
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.240]   of the noun we use for fellowship, koinonia, okay?
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.520]   And so that's why there's like a broader sense
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.840]   of being associate with us, like, open your life up,
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.300]   and let's run this race together,
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:23.160]   is almost a mentality that you have within this verse.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.400]   That kind of mentality is shared
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.920]   in a lot of different passages,
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.640]   but one of the passages I want to highlight for you guys,
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.680]   it's not here on the PowerPoint, but just listen.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.640]   When Apostle Paul was talking about his ministry,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.280]   he said to the church in Thessalonica
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.440]   that we prove to be gentle among you,
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.840]   as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.920]   Having so fond an affection for you,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:48.040]   we were well-pleased to impart to you
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.480]   not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives,
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   because you had become very dear to us.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.120]   So from the ministering perspective inside,
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.880]   you have to have an open-hearted,
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.960]   generous love in your heart
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.020]   that comes out of a thankfulness for Christ
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   in order to do ministry like Apostle Paul's doing, right?
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.240]   Not a selfish one, but such a selfless one.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.280]   And essentially, Apostle Paul then
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.360]   requests the same of the church.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.860]   So here's an interesting passage in 2 Corinthians 6,
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.000]   verse 11 through 13.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.040]   Paul says, "Our mouth was spoken freely to you,
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.340]   "O Corinthians, our heart is open wide,
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.760]   "and you're not restrained by us,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.000]   "but you're restrained by your own affections.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.840]   "Now in like exchange, I speak as to children,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.360]   "open wide to us also."
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.920]   Okay, open wide to us also.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.840]   Later, he's going to, just in the next chapter,
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.000]   2 Corinthians 7, he says,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.140]   "Therefore, having these promises, beloved,
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.800]   "let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh,
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.900]   "and then of spirits, perfecting holiness
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.100]   "in the fear of God.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.640]   "Make room for us in your hearts.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.840]   "We wronged nobody.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.160]   "We corrupted no one.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.480]   "We took advantage of no one.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.820]   "I do not speak to condemn you,
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:07.560]   "for I have said before that you are in our hearts
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.380]   "to die together and to live together."
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:16.080]   What an amazing kind of mentality and attitude, right?
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.840]   And so again, I think what is expected
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.000]   is not just simply a ministry is hard,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.680]   make sure you remember and provide
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.760]   like material goods for the pastor.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.880]   That's included in other passages, right?
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.000]   Here, I think Apostle Paul would have just loved it
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.040]   if they opened up their hearts,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.400]   because so far, it seems like reading in between the lines,
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.880]   they weren't actually receptive
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.400]   of the kind of heart he was showing them,
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.680]   which was trying to correct and bring them
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.760]   out of the deceptions that they were in, right?
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.760]   So in that way, I think this idea of sharing all good things
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:58.780]   really is inclusive of a general openheartedness,
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.440]   general receptiveness, mutual encouragement,
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.520]   and maybe even just the thought of being in this ministry,
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.240]   being in this kingdom work together, okay?
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.480]   Moving forward to verse seven and eight, the second part.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.800]   The second part that we described as,
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.960]   hey, there is a universal principle,
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.840]   whatever you seed and plant and sow,
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.160]   you're going to get the fruit, right?
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.700]   And it should be so plain and obvious
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.040]   that it doesn't require like, okay, what's happening here?
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.120]   There are consequences to your decisions,
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.620]   your thoughts, your words, everything.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.280]   That's the principle, right?
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.760]   But what's really interesting is he says,
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.960]   do not be deceived and God isn't mocked.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.720]   And as soon as he says that, we're like, whoa.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.760]   The tone of that takes it to a whole nother level.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.440]   So then we have to ask the question,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.680]   who is being deceived and what kind of deceptions
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.660]   are they being deceived by?
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:56.660]   But also, why is God being mocked by their decisions?
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.300]   Why is God being mocked by their deception, right?
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.400]   We have to ask those questions.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.360]   Now, what's very clear just from the end of verse seven
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.660]   where he says, four, because whatever man sows,
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.000]   he will also reap, he gives us this principle.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.500]   If you think that because you are free,
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.940]   that you can do what you desire
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.780]   and then simply escape the consequences,
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.040]   you're dead wrong, right?
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.360]   That's the deception.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.080]   He said earlier in the previous segments of the passage
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.200]   or the chapter that those of us who feel like,
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.920]   now that because we are free, we are children of God,
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.600]   and then all of a sudden, we take full advantage of it
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.360]   to the point of cheapening his grace,
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.880]   we 100% offend God, we mock him, right?
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.680]   And just the sheer deception that sometimes people have,
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.100]   which is, I know this may be compromise,
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.340]   I know this may be sin, but I'll just repent of it later
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.620]   and get back on track.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.260]   I'll give in now, but I'll do better later, right?
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:04.420]   What kind of crazy deception for a slave of God,
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:08.100]   a child of God, in that moment to think he can disobey?
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.880]   Right?
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.960]   There are constant deceptions all around us,
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:15.760]   but one of the egregious deception is to think
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.160]   that there is no consequence.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.000]   Why?
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.800]   Why?
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.120]   Take a moment to think about that,
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.380]   and as you think, think about this photo, okay?
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.180]   What is this little boy doing?
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:30.160]   He's doing the nose up
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.760]   and doing the na-na-na-na-na thing, right, okay?
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.840]   He's mocking somebody, and the scripture says,
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.280]   if we ask the most important question
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.740]   about any decision you make,
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:41.840]   what does God think about this
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.020]   and how does he see you when you do it?
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.060]   Is he pleased?
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:51.300]   When you act like there are no consequences, you mock him.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.220]   Why?
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.780]   Because you're testing him.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.600]   You know what you're doing is, literally, the Greek word,
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.020]   it comes from this Greek term, mutsterizo,
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.820]   which comes from a root term
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.100]   that we now use for the term mucus, okay?
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.820]   Back then, can you imagine somebody who scoffed, right?
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.780]   Or if you imagine somebody who's very disrespectful,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.940]   you imagine them, like, spit on their shoe or whatever.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.600]   Back then, they used to do the runner thing
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.020]   where they put their thumb on one nostril and clear it,
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.620]   and that's the literal term.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.500]   Or you stick your nose up out of disrespect.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.900]   I guess, to make it even more modern, it's like this guy.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.740]   What you gonna do, okay?
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.300]   I wanted you to remember the thought
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.300]   the next time you are tempted to compromise, okay?
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:43.460]   For us, in our selfish, childish mind,
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.580]   the moment of compromise is chock full
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:49.220]   of risk and benefit analysis.
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.340]   But am I gonna enjoy it?
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.860]   Am I gonna miss this opportunity to have this da-da-da-da-da?
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.500]   I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm just gonna do it once,
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:57.580]   and you're just constantly calculating risk,
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:01.060]   but we're not thinking about the picture God sees of us,
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.760]   which is, I'm gonna do this thing, what are you gonna do?
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:10.660]   Have you ever considered that you test God
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.160]   each time you compromise?
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.460]   You're not gonna punish me now, you never have.
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:19.580]   You're not gonna do anything about it, you never did.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.860]   When we do that, we mock God
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:25.440]   as inconsequential to our decisions.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.460]   And scripture says, don't be fooled.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.240]   Whatever you sow, does it take time?
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.140]   Yes, because God graciously gave time.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.780]   But trust me, you will reap what you sow.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.960]   That's how the passage comes off, okay?
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.960]   So, when we think about that then, what arrogance,
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.380]   what pomp to challenge God?
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.660]   And I just wanna make mention of this idea again,
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:53.500]   that for us, we want to today talk a bit
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.060]   about the idea of motivations in our heart, yes?
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.380]   And let this be a motivation to us,
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.140]   that when we compromise in our hearts,
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.160]   we absolutely look like this individual,
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   where we offend, where we act as though God cannot do.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.380]   Okay, so then that being the case,
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.540]   we come back to this passage
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.840]   of the kind of universal principle that exists,
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.160]   verse eight and nine, where it talks about
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.620]   that if you sow to the flesh, you will reap, right?
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.320]   From the flesh, its corruptions.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.380]   And then, those who sow to the spirit
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.940]   will from the spirit reap eternal life.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:33.540]   Here is a powerful cross-reference in Proverbs,
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.620]   chapter one, verse 28 through 33.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.220]   Proverbs one, 28 through 33, it says,
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.540]   "Then, they will call on me, but I will not answer."
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:47.060]   But, "And they will seek me diligently,
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.580]   "but they will not find me, because they hated knowledge
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.300]   "and did not choose the fear of the Lord.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.860]   "They would not accept my counsel.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:55.380]   "They spurned all my reproof.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:59.340]   "So, they shall eat the fruit of their own way
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.320]   "and be satiated with their own devices,
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.840]   "for the waywardness of the naive will kill them."
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.240]   Wow, "The complacency of fools will destroy them,
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.180]   "but he who listens to me shall live securely
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.040]   "and be at ease from the dread of evil."
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.760]   Did you see that?
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.500]   In our passage, it talked about how,
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.680]   when you sow to the flesh, from that flesh,
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.040]   you will reap the consequences or the corruption, right?
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.520]   The destruction and the decay, et cetera.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.520]   This passage, what he's saying is God,
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.200]   in his own might and will, will cause us,
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:42.020]   as a kind of the regular wrath, the regular consequences,
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.040]   the judgment to come, we are going to be bound
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.440]   by those same devices.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   If we think, even just a sin of,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.020]   let's just throw a bit up there, laziness.
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.740]   You hear something, and in your procrastinating heart,
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.440]   you just say, "Later."
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.900]   Do you not think that that seed
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.780]   will also bear its fruit in due time?
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:08.460]   Interesting and convicting to think about, right?
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.980]   If we have, in here, this passage is challenging us,
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.460]   if we have an unresponsive heart to truth,
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.260]   we have a lackadaisical attitude to God's commands,
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.100]   do you not think that that will bear its rotten fruit?
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.180]   And God says it'll be so rotten
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.380]   that by that kind of naivety, that kind of ignorance,
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.260]   you will be bound.
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:33.620]   Another passage, in Hosea 10, verse 12, it says,
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.700]   "So with the view of righteousness,
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.140]   "reap in accordance with kindness.
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.820]   "Break up your fallow ground,
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.420]   "for it is time to seek the Lord
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:44.460]   "until he comes to rain righteousness on you.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:49.220]   "You have plowed wickedness, and you have reaped injustice.
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.020]   "You have eaten the fruit of lies,
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.500]   "because you trusted in your way in the numerous warriors."
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.460]   The whole rationale here is this,
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:01.440]   God often works by way of just desert.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.700]   What's really strange throughout the,
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.180]   like a thematic thing of scripture,
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:09.420]   you will find if people, this passage in Hosea,
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.420]   he's talking very specifically to Ephraim,
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.340]   which essentially played a hand
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.380]   in the destruction of Israel, right?
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:19.180]   And he says, "Because you were merciless,
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.180]   "because all of their cries for help
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:26.180]   "was fallen on deaf ears, the same happens to you," right?
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.900]   And so God has essentially,
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:34.380]   like a theme of just deserts and irony.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.420]   Those individuals craved meat
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.460]   and nothing but selfish desires,
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.380]   they died by it and choked.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.140]   Those individuals who gave themselves
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.380]   and trusted other nations,
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.460]   they died by the betrayal of those nations, right?
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.660]   And then likewise, the same way in Romans 1,
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.620]   what does God say?
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.860]   You long for these?
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.380]   You want this to be your idol God?
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.360]   Then here, have it.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.720]   Let me give you over to that which is your idol, okay?
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:03.300]   So with that said,
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.740]   I just wanna make mention of this kind of thought here,
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.960]   which is here, by way of application,
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.320]   we have a couple things to kind of think about.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.320]   One is the thought of clearly then, if we are wise,
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.320]   we're wisening up to the idea
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.840]   that even small seeds of the flesh,
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.360]   small opportunities and provisions for the flesh
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.200]   will have its growth to the fruit, right?
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.600]   And so here, there's probably something
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.620]   you guys have come across before,
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:39.360]   written by this British author, Samuel Smiles,
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.560]   "Sow a thought, reap an act.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.800]   "Sow an act, you reap a habit.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.040]   "Sow a habit, and you reap character.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.960]   "Sow a character, and you reap destiny," right?
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.320]   Quite profound.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.280]   In the counseling world, this is very, very helpful, okay?
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.400]   You may find an individual who is just like,
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.320]   let's say, for example,
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.200]   there are many sins we could fall into
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.280]   and have a moment of passionate sin,
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.360]   whether it's lust,
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.960]   and you give into pornography or something,
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.880]   or like a burst of anger, a fit of rage, right?
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.440]   So let's say an individual,
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.560]   all of a sudden, they just blow up at the house,
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.720]   they scream at the kids, they scream at the wife,
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.200]   they punch a hole in the wall,
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.440]   and then once they go outside,
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.120]   they're like, "Oh my goodness."
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.460]   They come in for counseling and they say,
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.340]   "I'm not even sure what happened.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.260]   "Something just snapped," they'll say.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.160]   But as a counselor, what do we say?
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.360]   Why don't you tell me the whole story?
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.800]   Did you have a fight with your spouse?
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.800]   It's like, you know, two weeks ago?
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:34.920]   How did you reconcile that?
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.880]   You know we didn't.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.440]   You didn't reconcile that.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.640]   How were your, what was your thought life like then
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.560]   in the last two weeks since you haven't reconciled?
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.460]   You know, we're just going back and forth.
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.400]   Was it cold in the house?
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.480]   Like, yes.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.560]   Did you ever lose sleep over it?
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.120]   Yeah, at night I was just kind of wondering,
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.560]   like, why would she say that, and da-da-da.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.840]   It's like, so, essentially, in the evening,
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.720]   at night, you're preparing to fight.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.200]   You put words in your mouth.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.860]   You're getting ready, right?
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.880]   Another way to say it is,
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.480]   people say this kind of idiomatic wisdom,
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.520]   which is, you don't go from zero to 100 just like that.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.040]   What you have is you have a moment of compromise,
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.640]   and even though maybe in your mind,
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640]   it's like, I went to the family retreat.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.940]   They said reconcile, but I didn't, right?
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:21.480]   Why did you make provision for your bitter heart
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.300]   to get ready for a fight?
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:28.360]   There are earlier compromises to trace.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.560]   You don't think that little seed of disobedience
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.240]   when God said, we'll go reconcile, and you didn't,
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.760]   that it would not bear its ugly fruit later?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.240]   Of course it does, yes?
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.480]   It's the same, even for, again, instinctual,
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.720]   like, lust sins, or things that we feel like
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.200]   it just happened.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.320]   It's like, no, most likely,
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.520]   you made compromises and provisions.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.460]   Why did you spend three hours, like,
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:54.260]   just filtering through the videos that Facebook feeds you?
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:56.120]   Why did you go watch that, I don't know,
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.440]   whatever thing it is that was just provocative?
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.140]   Why did you, there are little trails, is my point,
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.400]   and it's wise for us to trace that.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.160]   But the second part, too, the second part,
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.960]   is this passage is trying to show us,
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   by way of motivation, you know there are consequences.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.560]   And yet, in our, just like, volition to sin,
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.900]   we don't want to see it, right?
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.600]   And to quote our pastor, one time,
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.720]   I remember he just gave this hilarious,
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.080]   it's an axiom that we have, right?
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.760]   It's like, you wanna have your cake and eat it?
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.660]   And then he added to it, said, you wanna have your cake
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:32.940]   and eat it and not get fat, right?
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:36.340]   Like, all of this is in our hearts.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.540]   The desire to have everything and its benefits, too,
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.160]   even in scenarios where, yes, you can't eat the cake
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.500]   and then save it for later.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.240]   You either eat the cake or you save it for later.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.860]   But we also want to eat it, save it, have it,
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.100]   and not have any of its consequences.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:55.020]   Is that at all in your heart, right?
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.700]   Is that at all in your heart?
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.140]   Okay, with that said, let's move on
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:03.680]   to the last portion of it, which is part three, okay?
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.880]   Which is let us not lose heart in doing good, okay?
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.820]   Let us not lose heart in doing good.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:14.760]   Here, he essentially gives us such encouragement.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.440]   If some of you have been getting weary,
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.380]   if some of you have been feeling fatigued,
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.980]   he gives us challenge and encouragement in due time, right?
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.300]   In due time.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:30.380]   And what's more, this passage is, in some sense,
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.820]   very sympathetic, challenging us not to lose heart,
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.800]   not to grow weary, et cetera,
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.640]   but that while we have this opportunity,
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.120]   he gives a sense of urgency and motivation, saying,
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.360]   "Listen, this life truly is short,
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.680]   "and we have this season, yes?
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.880]   "On this side of heaven, we have this season
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.360]   "to do the work of God, to invest into the kingdom,
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.280]   "and he wants us to bear good fruit
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.180]   "and to do good works," right?
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:00.420]   And what I wanna say is, this part of it,
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:03.060]   it's chock-full, it's within so many different parts
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.040]   of scripture, that our ability to meet the needs
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.500]   of the people around us, to love the brethren,
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.540]   is going to be our definitive marker
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:12.880]   as a child of God, amen?
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.900]   And we have to ask the question,
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:19.380]   is that something that I am growing in right now,
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.700]   or is that something I'm getting tired of, right?
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.800]   And it's just an honest, genuine question for you guys.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.060]   Some of you guys, I believe our church is active.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.220]   Whenever we have sign-ups, like right now,
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:36.060]   this past weekend, we had VBS Workshop for Volunteers.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:40.160]   On the volunteer roster, there are over 140 volunteers.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.460]   To me, incredible encouragement.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:47.080]   The worry is that people will grow tired, yes?
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.640]   Okay.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.200]   But when we think about that, we have to ask the question,
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.160]   what's the problem?
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.480]   It's just too hard.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.120]   It's like, well, technically, we've done VBS every year.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.680]   I mean, it's not something that's so hard,
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.240]   it's gonna kill us, you know?
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.160]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.360]   It doesn't have to be VBS, other things too.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.540]   For us, most likely, the trouble isn't just the nature
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:14.540]   of the work itself, the trouble is motivation, right?
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.860]   The trouble is motivation.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:20.400]   Are we actually having the vision,
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.760]   are we having the goals, are we having the hope,
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.780]   are we having the kind of future hope of reaping,
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:30.520]   are we having sight and mind of what God has in store,
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.880]   what he's able to do?
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.280]   If we're not, of course we're gonna grow tired.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:40.540]   You know, just talking about the topic as an example
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.160]   of ADD and ADHD, or like the attention deficit
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.840]   or even the hyper portion of it,
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.340]   what's really interesting is if you look at the CDC
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.960]   or even the NIH, et cetera, they'll just describe
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.720]   and say, you know, individuals who have a hard time
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.920]   at work or at school because they're short
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.920]   on attention span.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.120]   More recently, they have been doing other kinds of studies,
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.320]   and those other kinds of studies,
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.040]   they would take these children and they'd put 'em in a room
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.120]   when they're watching Star Wars.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:09.300]   Guess how they did?
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.100]   Perfectly fine.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:16.000]   Not only that, but if you take a student with ADD
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.240]   and then you put them in a room just with the video game
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.600]   and leave them without their parents on their own,
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.400]   they could last for hours on end.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:27.640]   As a matter of fact, they won't even take a pee-pee break.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.040]   Why?
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.360]   Part of that is because for video games,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.780]   the reward is instantaneous.
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:36.240]   When you're working with a piece of paper,
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.720]   the rewards are super delayed.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.360]   You don't get 'em until the end of the semester.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.920]   Does that make sense?
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.760]   They have found that giving immediate reward
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.920]   for individuals with ADD, ADHD, et cetera,
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.680]   drastically changes all of their behavior,
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:52.720]   all their capacity.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.160]   Why am I talking about this?
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.120]   It's because here we're looking at motivation.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.220]   The scripture is challenging us.
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.540]   We have motivation in Christ.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.940]   We have His pure blessings.
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.880]   How does the Galatians, how does the book of Galatians
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.520]   tackle the problem of perseverance?
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.200]   He says you're free in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.000]   He says you're part of this grand promise.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.920]   You're children of promise.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.800]   You have not just simply Mount, you know,
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.200]   like Mount Sinai to look for.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.000]   You don't have an earthly mountain to look for,
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   and you definitely don't have
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.720]   just simply a system to look for.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.240]   You have the heavenly one, right?
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.360]   He gives you identity.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.920]   He gives you hope for all eternity,
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.520]   and then He says you're actually free to love.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.800]   You're free to serve the Lord.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.560]   So concluding with this kind of cross-reference here,
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.600]   it says 1 Peter chapter two.
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.240]   For such is the will of God.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:54.240]   For us, the motivation, internal to the will of the Lord,
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.560]   that by doing right you may silence
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.600]   the ignorance of the foolish men,
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.160]   act as free men, and do not use your freedom
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.360]   as a covering for evil,
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.720]   but use it as bond slaves of God.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.000]   Honor all people, love the brotherhood,
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.280]   fear God, and honor the king.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.480]   If, if we tackled, let's say for example,
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.880]   attention deficit and told a young student,
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   "Dude, grow up.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.240]   "You have to be self-motivated.
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.600]   "You have to want to succeed in life.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.520]   "You're never gonna succeed like this.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.480]   "Do it for yourself," right?
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.000]   What do you think would happen?
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.800]   Honestly speaking, what do you think would happen?
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.120]   Likewise, I hope, I hope you know
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.720]   that within the Christian faith,
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.880]   trying to motivate you, it's like,
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.360]   "Hey, just do it for yourself,"
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.160]   or just simply, "You can do it," or something like that.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.960]   If you were to find a source of energy and motivation
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.640]   deep in your heart, Scripture literally says,
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.160]   "This would be an impossible task."
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.860]   But for every single one of us, we have hope,
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.800]   hope in our Savior, hope in His promise,
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.120]   hope in the mighty hand of God
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.160]   to accomplish everything that He said He will do,
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:10.000]   not only in all of history,
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.580]   but in your specific private life, amen?
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:13.420]   Let's pray.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:22.260]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the encouragement
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.620]   and challenge of your word.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:28.240]   God, we do have tendencies, Lord,
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.880]   to sometimes be so self-focused,
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.720]   insulated, always preserving and protecting self.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.680]   But God, we know that you have called us, God,
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.160]   to express what you have given to us
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.000]   in the fullness of Christ, in an outward working of love,
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.800]   a power to be vulnerable, a power to give,
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.000]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.640]   grace, and God, even good intention.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.440]   So I pray, Lord, that you will encourage
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.200]   and challenge us to do so.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.940]   God, that we would bear good fruit to your glory.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.400]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.240]   Thanks, everyone.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.400]   (audience applauding)
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.980]   (gentle music)
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.400]   (gentle music continues)
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.820]   (gentle music continues)
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:26.240]   (gentle music continues)
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.660]   (gentle music continues)
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:34.300]   and God, we thank you for the encouragement
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:38.720]   and challenge of your word, in an outward working of love,
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.040]   a power to be vulnerable, a power to give,
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.480]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.320]   grace, and God, even good intention.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.160]   So I pray, Lord, that you would encourage
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.400]   and challenge us to do so, in an outward working of love,
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.840]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.440]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.440]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,

[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:17.080]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.080]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.080]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.200]   in thankfulness to lavish others with mercy,
